Today the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices (ACIP) met, to decide recommendations on COVID-19 vaccines for 2024.  Let's go
see what went down.  

## Agenda  

The meeting is about several things, only one of which is COVID-19.  I suppose that's good
news, of a sort, in that COVID-19 is now something we consider along with other medical
problems instead of the world-ending disaster it might have been.  This meeting also
considers Chikungunya vaccines, diphtheria/tetanus vaccines, influenza vaccines, and polio
vaccines.

We'll concentrate on just the COVID-19 part.  The agenda for that is shown here
<sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> in the morning, with voting to happen along with other
matters later in the day at 2pm. 

There's even another part to the meeting tomorrow, though nothing COVID-19-related.  

Looks pretty much like what you'd expect: some views on hospitalization and vaccine uptake
rates, a review of efficacy and an economic (!) analysis, and then reasoning from evidence
to recommendations.  

## Presentations  

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/helenbranswell.bsky.social/post/3kmi5ph73bz2m"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-helen-1.jpg" width="400" height="191" alt="Helen Branswell @ STAT: Skeet Thread on ACIP Meeting" title="Helen Branswell @ STAT: Skeet Thread on ACIP Meeting" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Mostly we'll rely on the presentations archived for the meeting, but occasionally today
we'll check in on the BlueSky skeet thread of the redoubtable Helen Branswell of _STAT
News_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, because she picks up a lot of detail and nuance,
and has been our trusted native guide in the past.  Her main point so far is that there
are at least 6 vacancies on the ACIP that have not yet been filled, no idea why, so 6 CDC
folk will sit in as _ex officio_ members on this meeting.  

I'm not going to watch the video and listen to the arguments, because that's too much
bandwidth for my Long COVID-19 befogged brain to handle.  But I _will_ go through each of
the presentations, hunting for surprises.  

### Introduction to the Meeting  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-intro.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="M Daley, CDC: Introduction to the Meeting" title="M Daley, CDC: Introduction to the Meeting" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As expected, there's not much to report here. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

It's pretty much a summary of past meetings and recommendations for the Moderna, Pfizer,
and Novavax vaccines.  There's a list of CDC personnel involved, as well as the voting
meeting members.  

The latter might be of interest if you're trying to track member voting records to analyze
for bias, otherwise this is _pro forma_ and as expected.  

(Beyond _pro forma:_ Helen Branswell might point out that there are a lot of vacancies
here, so the membership is CDC-heavy, with 11 CDC members and 2 outside advisors (slide
5).  That&hellip; needs correction.  Now.)  

### Hospital Surveillance  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-hosp-1.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance" title="COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-hosp-2.jpg" width="400" height="405" alt="Hospitalization surveillance geographical coverage" title="Hospitalization surveillance geographical coverage" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
This is a COVID-19 hospitalization surveillance report from COVID-NET, a component of the
CDC RESP-Net program.  <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  They have pretty broad coverage:
&gt;300 acute-care hospitals in 98 counties in 13 states, 9/10 HHS regions.  This reaches
about 10% of the US population.  (High coverage in Maryland is understandable given that's
where the CDC is.  High coverage in New Mexico and Michigan are harder to explain?)  

They're looking at SARS-CoV-2 positive patients within 14 days or during hospitalization,
as shown by screening or clinician-driven testing.  
- Hospitalization rates break down along age groups as you'd expect, with the older clades
  being hospitalized more often.  
- Current rates are about 40 per 100,000 among those over 75.  Among those, about 25% were
  in long-term care facilities.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-hosp-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-hosp-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="223" alt="Hospitalization death rates are high among elders" title="Hospitalization death rates are high among elders" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-hosp-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-hosp-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="221" alt="Overwhelming prevalence of unvaccinated among the hospitalized" title="Overwhelming prevalence of unvaccinated among the hospitalized" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Two other conclusions were pretty stark:  
- First, while the death rate of 1.4% at ages 18-49 sounds low, that's still a lot of
  people.  But the real point of this slide is that the death rate among elders is 5.5%.
  Basically, if you're older and get hospitalized for COVID-19, 1 in 20 of you will die.
  This is amazingly high, and should prompt a relentless vaccination education program for
  elders, particularly those in long-term care.  
- Second, the overwhelming majority of those hospitalized are unvaccinated (or for whom
  there is no record of vaccination).  At this point, remaining unvaccinated is just a
  death wish, and we desperately need to educate elders about this to get them
  vaccinated.  
  - __NB:__ There is a nuance here, since we'r observing that
    $\Pr(\mathrm{Unvaccinated} \| \mathrm{Hospitalized})$ is high, since we're looking only at
    the hospitalized population.  
  - The real risk of course is the Bayesian dual,
    $\Pr(\mathrm{Hospitalized} \| \mathrm{Unvaccinated})$ to uncover the real risks of
    remaining unvaccinated.  When we've examined that before on this Crummy Little Blog
    That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), it's been utterly damning: remaining unvaccinated
    dramatically shortens lives.  
	
### Vaccine Coverage  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-1.jpg" width="400" height="142" alt="Current vaccine coverage" title="Current vaccine coverage" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next, on to vaccine coverage. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  This, alas, is some pretty
concerning stuff!  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="279" alt="Vaccine coverage: stratifies by age, young largely not up to date" title="Vaccine coverage: stratifies by age, young largely not up to date" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- As shown in the graph here from slide 3, uptake of the 2023-2024 booster from last fall
  has been (a) low, (b) slow, and (c) stratified by age:  
  - The plateau is only 40% uptake, and that's among elders who received the most
    benefit.  Why not more of them?  No idea, here.  
  - It took almost 3 months to reach the apparently-final plateau.  Why did people take so
    long to make such an obvious decision?  No idea, here.  
  - In some ways worst of all, the uptake curves stratify by age.  Younger people took up
    the booster at measly rates of 5% &ndash; 20%.  This means they get sick, again and
    again, accumulating damage and risks of Long COVID.  They also become carriers who
    force the elders with whom the come in contact to be exposed to potentially lethal
    risks ("granny-killer" is the derisive, but apt, term).  Why such contempt for their
    own future health and that of their elders?  No idea, here.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="173" alt="Vaccine coverage: still low vaccination in Trumpy red states" title="Vaccine coverage: still low vaccination in Trumpy red states" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Ok, so who _are_ these people stubbornly refusing a booster?  We see the geographic
  distribution on slide 4, shown here.  As you can see, the concentration is miserably
  high in the American South, and some Midwestern states.  
  - These are the red/Trumpy states that resist not just vaccines, but science education
    in general, want to whitewash their complicity in slavery in the Civil War, 
    criminalize women's health care, and lots of other barbarisms.  
  - We've previously documented the undeniable relationship between county-level Trump
    voting rates and vaccine resistance rates.  The only consolation there is a dark one:
    this is evolution in action, where stupidity is given capital punishment.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="141" alt="Stubborn resistance in 40% - 60% of population" title="Stubborn resistance in 40% - 60% of population" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Is this a new thing?  Alas, no, as shown by this plot on slide 5.  It's from a survey of
  $N = 257,352$ people, asking about their intentions to get a booster (or a vaccine at
  all).  
  - We see, sustained over time the last 6 months, that there is a steady cohort of
    people who absolutely refuse vaccination (about 40%) and another cohort that is
    wishy-washy or somehow "unsure" (about 30%).  
  - That means 60% &ndash; 70% of people behave recklessly enough to explain why we have low
    vaccine uptake numbers that endanger all of us.  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-5.jpg" width="400" height="345" alt="Fears of vaccination: pretty much canards, one and all" title="Fears of vaccination: pretty much canards, one and all" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- Ok&hellip; _sigh:_ it's largely a Southern/Midwestern/Trumpy thing, and it persists over time.
  What can they possibly be afraid of this time?  Consider this extract from slide 11,
  detailing the frightening canards:  
  - They fear "unknown" side-effects in a medication that has had _billions_ of doses
    given.  I'm not sure how _anything_ can be an unknown side effect at this point, but
    rationality isn't what's going on here.  
  - They _still_ think not enough human trials have been done&hellip; in spite of
    the largest Phase IV trial in human history, where _billions_ of people have been
    vaccinated.  This is pure hallucination.  
  - They "don't trust" government or pharma companies.  I get it, but I don't get why they
    want to die for this paranoia.  
  - They think the relatively rare cardiac inflammation is _way_ more common, in spite of
    ample statistical evidence to the contrary.  
  - And, of course, they think the vaccines _don't work_.  I can't even begin to
    understand the utter bone-headed hopelessness of this view.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-6.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-6-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="213" alt="Attitudes toward vaccination have deteriorated since 2022" title="Attitudes toward vaccination have deteriorated since 2022" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Has it been getting worse?  Sadly, yes, according to the analysis from slide 17 shown
  here.  
  - Confidence in vaccines has _declined_ over the last 2 years, despite the overwhelming
    success of the mRNA vaccines in particular.  
  - In parallel, people have become quite blas&eacute; about the importance of vaccination
    and the risks of getting COVID-19.  This in spite of the increasing evidence of the
    accumulation of risk of Long COVID-19 with each infection.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-7.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-coverage-7-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="216" alt="HCP reasons not to recommend vaccines are pretty bogus, too" title="HCP reasons not to recommend vaccines are pretty bogus, too" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Ok, what about health care providers?  Surely they, as people educated in these matters,
  must be giving better reasons?  Again alas, no, not according to the data presented on
  slide 22.  The list of reasons why HCP's sometimes don't recommend vaccination (which
  can _occasionally_ be the right thing) are in fact pretty silly.  They include fear a
  patient would refuse, patients being "tired of hearing about COVID-19", community
  vaccine resistance, thinking vaccines aren't protective enough, just no time in a visit
  to discuss or give a vaccine (thanks, insurance executive MBA's!), and so on.  

Can you tell I'm incandescently angry about our low vaccine uptake?  

Public health is not a matter of personal responsibility!  Public health is a _public_
matter, in which we must be responsible for each other by practicing good preventive
medicine for ourselves and others.  

Thinking only of public health as a personal responsibility is a sociopathic level of
self-regard.  

Nevertheless, here we are.  

### Vaccine Efficacy  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-eff-1.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="Vaccine efficacy report by Ruth Link-Gelles" title="Vaccine efficacy report by Ruth Link-Gelles" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So vaccine coverage is pretty miserable; we're just not vaccinating enough people and the
reasons given are delusional.  

How about vaccine efficacy?  Maybe the vaccines are _so good_ that it won't matter?

Dream on, alas.  The report on vaccine efficacy <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> tells us
the news.  Not _exactly_ bad news, but at best mediocre.  

She starts out wisely by reviewing the definition of efficacy and debunking some of the
bonehead misconceptions about it.  If $p_v$ is the probability of getting
infected, hospitalized, or dead in the vaccinated population, and $p_c$ is the similar
probability in the control population, then vaccine efficacy is:  

$$
VE = 100\% \times \frac{p_c - p_v}{p_c} = 100\% \times \left(1 - \frac{p_v}{p_c}\right)
$$

That is, how much does vaccination lower the chance of getting infected, hospitalized, or dead,
expressed as a percent of the baseline rate $p_c$?  

It strongly depends on the outcome measure (infected at all, hospitalized with serious
disease, or death).  It also depends on the control group: totally unvaccinated people,
people with another vaccine, people with the previous vaccine but without a booster, etc.

We should _expect_ the number to change, since the background population has changed
since 2020.  We should also expect it to change since
[sensitivity and specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) of
testing has changed, too.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-eff-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-eff-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Vaccine efficacy: debunking misconceptions" title="Vaccine efficacy: debunking misconceptions" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
She then &mdash; admirably, in my view &mdash; addresses some of the public's
misconceptions about vaccines.  The problem with any sentence involving the word
"probability" is that the public will replace that with "opinion" or "can be ignored for
now".  Here on slide 5 she points out that "80% efficacy" does _not_ mean the vaccine only
works 80% of the time; it is a _population level_ statement about _lowering your risk by 80%._  

Once again, public health is a _public_ matter, requiring collective action, not just
individual responsibility.  It's good to remember that these committee meetings and their
public archives are meant to address the public, as well as professionals.  

Here we're comparing those getting the updated 2023 &ndash; 2024 booster vs those who were
eligible for it but did not receive it.  That control group has considerable built-in
immunity due to previous vaccinations and previous infections, so we should expect
efficacy lower than the initial 95% in 2020 (compared to a then-na&iuml;ve population).  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-eff-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-eff-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Vaccine efficacy of booster vs partially immune control population: about 50%" title="Vaccine efficacy of booster vs partially immune control population: about 50%" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
She looks at this multiple different ways (symptomatic infection vs hospitalization,
measuring infection by antigen test vs more sensitive tests, and stratifying by age).
That's admirable, but we can summarize: all of them give results around 50% efficacy,
i.e., the booster _reduces risk by about 50%._

Slide 10 shows this, for symptomatic infection, stratified by age and by time since
boosting.  All the results are around 50%, with error bars going from 30% to 70%.  Other
slides look at other outcomes and other test methods, but all say around 50% risk
reduction.  

Keep in mind, that's a 50% reduction in risk, _on top of_ the immunity already present in
our population with a high rate of previous infection and reasonable (though not high
enough) rate of vaccination.  Still pretty good!  

### Economics of an Additional Dose for Elders  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-econ-1.jpg" width="400" height="245" alt="Economic analysis of additional boosters for the elderly" title="Economic analysis of additional boosters for the elderly" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next up was an economic analysis of giving additional doses to the
elderly. <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  

I have to be honest: I _hate_ this sort of thinking.  
- First, there is a great deal more to life than economics.  If you let economics be your
  guide in all things, you've assumed a simpler
  [utility function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility) than I'd prefer.  The downside
  of that is the inevitability of [utility monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster),
  i.e., being forced into cruel behavior to those with little money or power.  (This is the
  source of so much cruelty in libertarianism that makes me hold it in complete contempt.)  
- Second, I used to hear this sort of argument in the workplace every couple months about
  mental health research.  It always went something like: depression costs us this many
  billions in lost work hours, so we should do research on treating it.  Really?  Work
  hours are the most important thing here?  The fact that depression makes people
  miserable and kills many is _not enough?_  
  
And so it is here.  Boosters save lives.  Shouldn't that be enough?  

But as it is for many people not enough&hellip; here we are.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-econ-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-econ-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Economic analysis: payoff in $/QALY is only for seniors" title="Economic analysis: payoff in $/QALY is only for seniors" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
I won't go through their analysis, because it was hard enough to stop the gorge rising the
first time through.  But here's their result, on slide 14.  
- They're measuring the cost in \$/QALY
  ([quality-adjusted life year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year),
  sort of medical calculation including number of years of life extension and the quality
  of life for those years).  
- The outcome says you make a "profit" in doing this for seniors, but not others.  (Those
  lives are too expensive to save, apparently.)  

(The analysis was done multiple ways, looking at 1-dose vs 2-dose strategies and measuring
various outputs, but the results indicated a similar outcome.)  

### Evidence to Recommendation Analysis of Additional Dose for Elders  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-e2r-1.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Evidence to Recommendations: what should policy be?" title="Evidence to Recommendations: what should policy be?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Ok, enough with the economic analysis.  The FDA and CDC have a formal process in place for
this, called Evidence to Recommendations, or E2R.  It's supposed to be a transparent way
of reasoning from what we see in nature to what we should do about it, policy-wise.  I'm
sure it's a nightmare in some ways, but it at least covers _some_ of the cases previously
seen, so let's at least try it.

That's the thrust of the next presentation: what does E2R say we should
do? <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  

They go through about the sorts of things you'd expect:  
- history of previous vaccinations,
- the response in terms of hospitalization &amp; death rate decreases, 
- seroprevalence of SARS-CoV2 stratified by infection history and age, 
- the immunology of aging, 
- whether the policy will have equitable impact, 
- rates of waning of vaccine-induced immunity, 
- vaccine safety in the affected groups, 

&hellip; and so on.  There's a _lot_ of stuff here.

I wasn't able to discern any mathematics in the E2R work, as apparently it's a way of
structuring arguments in the CDC committees.  But&hellip; it came out the same as above,
that seniors should get a booster.  

### Next Steps in the Vaccine Program  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-future-1.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="Future COVID-19 vaccine policy" title="Future COVID-19 vaccine policy" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Finally, they took a look forward at what vaccine policy should be in the future and what
strains should be included. <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>  

One big item was basically how to move faster!  Last year, we settled on the BA.2.86
strain with glacial slowness; consequently we're now using a vaccine based on BA.2.86
while the current dominant strain is JN.1.  Yes, there's some cross-reactivity, but not as
much as we'd like and it won't necessarily be that way next time.  So there was some
critical review of the timelines from last year.  

The annual flu vaccine manages to do this, as we've pointed out numerous times previously.
Now perhaps the CDC will put the COVID-19 timelines on a similar scale, and hope for a
similar result.  

And&hellip; that's basically it.  No discussion of future multivalent strains, or rapid
response of changing vaccine strains.  

A bit disappointing, but at least they acknowledge they've been too slow in the past.  


## Voting Results  

For this section, I watched live.  Started at 2:06pm, only 6min late, which is kind of
impressive, as these things go!  

Voting proposition: "ACIP recommends that persons &ge;65 years of age should receive an
additional dose of 2023-2024 formula COVID-19 vaccine."  
- Discussion point: 40% of elders don't have even the first shot, so improve that too.
  Also, dosing later than June if there's a new formulation this fall is suboptimal, so do
  it soon if at all.  
- Votes: Yes: 11, No: 1, Abstain: 1. All voters reported "no conflicts", i.e., not employed
  by or heavy stock ownership in a vaccine provider.  (On some of the other non-COVID-19
  votes, a few members had conflicts, declared them, and recused themselves.)  No
  discussion about the no vote or the abstention vote.  

So: by a vote of 11-1-1, the recommendation of a spring booster passed.

The venerable Globe reported this result the same evening. <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>
They emphasized that COVID-19 is _not_ seasonal, so there's year-round risk.  Boosts in
the elderly tend to wear off in about 180 days, so twice-yearly boosting just makes
sense.  The initial language saying this group "may" receive a booster was promoted to
"should", because why be wishy-washy when people will just use that as an excuse not to
listen?  Still, vaccine booster uptake remains disappointingly low.  

Now, how soon can I call my local pharmacy and expect them to have a clue what I'm talking
about?  I bet it'll take at least a week to percolate through insurance, PBMs, and
corporate bureaucracy.  


## Vaccine Composition Going Forward  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-vrbpac-1.jpg" width="400" height="181" alt="FDA VRBPAC meets 2024-May-16 to discuss vaccine strains for coming year" title="FDA VRBPAC meets 2024-May-16 to discuss vaccine strains for coming year" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So what about vaccine strains going forward, for this fast-evolving virus?  

The FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meets on
2024-May-16 to decide exactly that.  <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>  All we know for
now is that that's the agenda:  

> __Agenda__  
>  
> On May 16, 2024, the Committee will meet in open session to discuss and make
> __recommendations on the selection of strain(s) to be included in the 2024-2025 Formula for
> COVID-19 vaccines.__ The meeting presentations will be heard, viewed, captioned, and
> recorded through an online teleconferencing and/or video conferencing platform.  

The CDC's ACIP promises to meet in June to review previous results and bless (or not) the
new mix proposed by the FDA's VRBPAC.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-weekend-publisher-and-assistant.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-28-acip-covid-2024-recs-weekend-publisher-and-assistant-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher, ensconced in their executive chair" title="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher, ensconced in their executive chair" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

That's&hellip; more or less as expected?  

The Weekend Publisher and the Assistant Weekend Publisher, shown here in their top
management executive chair, agree that this is what _they_ expected.  

It seems quite obvious &ndash; though here we are, _a posteriori_, where it darn well
_should_ be obvious &ndash; that since immunity fades quickest in elders and
hospitalization is most likely lethal in elders, a boost for elders is sensible.

So why do these committee meetings always seem to take the long way 'round to reach a
conclusion that's sitting right there in front of them?  Before you resort to the
"government bureaucracy" slur, consider that they might be practicing "defensive
medicine", i.e., carefully documenting each decision to avoid it being used against them
(and against public health).  

They're just as aware as the rest of us, and probably more so, of the delusional
conspiracy thinkers who hallucinate various threats around vaccines.  By doing things this
way, they can just point people to the _public_ meeting record to show they've done the
required work, and done so transparently.  

They've dotted all the i's, crossed all the t's, and&hellip; for all I know, checked every umlaut
for b&ouml;&ouml;by traps.  You _can't_ credibly accuse CDC/ACIP of taking shortcuts, or
that not enough trials have been done, or not enough side effects have been considered, as
the crackpots were shown to believe above.  (But you _can_ credibly identify crackpots, when
they utter such arguments.)  

Yes, that's sad.  Also, surprising: I would not have thought pre-pandemic that we'd be
dense as a sack of bricks.  But, as all the existentialists say, here we are.  

So go get boosted if you're old enough.
