It's now 2 days into my course of paxlovid for COVID-19.  


## Another bit of a rough night  

The first night on paxlovid was the nightmare of never-ending diarrhea.  (Where did it all _come_
from?!  Must my intestines wind through
[a Hilbert space of mind-boggling dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space),
to hold that much, ummm&hellip; _ordure?_  Apparently so!  But none of my professors, when
teaching Hilbert space, ever used this example.  I wonder why&hellip;)  

The second night on paxlovid &ndash; last night &ndash; was the sore throat from hell.  I
had trouble swallowing even saliva, painful enough to stop getting to sleep.  I eventually
discovered that if I lay very still, breathed shallowly, and _pretended_ to be asleep,
saliva production would go down as if I _were_ asleep.  Then I wouldn't be jolted awake
when I had to swallow.  

Again, not ideal.  But probably closer to ideal than hospitalization for COVID-19 would
have been for me.

The protein shake is my usual fairly low(ish) carb, high protein breakfast.  It felt
_excellent_ against the sore tissues in my throat.  

The chaser, of course, is 2 tabs nirmatrelvir and 1 tab ritonavir.  

The patient-proof packaging, as we demonstrated yesterday, has been helpfully gnawed open
by the neighborhood velociraptor. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  


## Agenda du jour  

On today's agenda is a teleconference with the new doctor, partly to establish care
formally so she can renew prescriptions, but presumably also to review the paxlovid.  

For the latter purpose, the data this morning are: 
- sore throat quite annoying at night,  
- 1.0&deg;C fever, 
- diarrhea mostly resolved, and  
- joint/muscle aches mostly resolved.  

The sore throat and fever are the main things right now, so we'll see what aspirin can do
about that, and what the new doctor is like.  Symptoms seem to abate rapidly after taking
each dose of paxlovid, but that's likely psychosomatic, no?  

The video call was quite pleasant, basically going over medical history, renewing
prescriptions, and checking out my paxlovid experience (none of which was unusual).  Also,
turns out one _can_ take Mucinex to control coughing while on paxlovid, so that's good.  

Overall, the healthcare system did what I wanted here.  So far.  


## Spread within Ch&acirc;teau Weekend  

Confusingly, though gratifyingly, the Weekend Editrix continues to test negative.  That
may have something to do with the field of land mines she has laid at the base of the
stairs, to keep me confined to the 2nd story of the house. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
She's busy wrestling with some gnarly dental treatment right now anyway; COVID-19 is the
_last_ thing she needs!

Still, we're hoping the COVID-19 saga here at Chez Weekend remains confined to your humble
Weekend Editor.

<a id="fn1">1</a>: Initially, I was against the idea of having a neighborhood
velociraptor.  

"Won't it just eat us?", I plaintively asked the neighbors.  Fortunately,
they ignored me.  (On the other hand, _everybody_ usually does that, so no new information there.)  

Though, really, they should have sold me on the idea of a fast predator with a mouthful of
teeth serrated on the back side by explaining that it could open difficult containers for
neighborhood residents.  Obscurely sturdy blister packs of medication, maybe jars of
tomato sauce, that sort of thing.  

Dinosaurs, given the opportunity, can be quite helpful.  Who knew?  [↩](#fn1a)

We haven't been able to teach him pandemic discipline any more than the
unmasked nimrods on the MBTA shuttle bus who infected me last Saturday.[↩](#fn2a)
