Right-wing strategy: when [reality has a well-known liberal bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Reality_has_a_well_known_liberal_bias&redirect=no)&hellip; you can use legal gag orders to _force_ delusions upon people.  


## Ivermectin and Hydroxychloroquine: Zombie Ideas  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-20-ivermectin-gag-order-bi-1.jpg" width="400" height="173" alt="Constant @ Business Insider: Nobel laureat Paul Krugman on right-wing 'zombie ideas'" title="Constant @ Business Insider: Nobel laureat Paul Krugman on right-wing 'zombie ideas'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine as treatments for COVID-19 constitute one of those
_id&eacute;es fixe_ that the Trumpy conservatives simply _will not let go._  It's in fact
what Nobel laureate Paul Krugman calls a 'zombie idea': so thoroughly debunked that it's
thoroughly dead, "demonstrably false", but somehow stupidly shambles along eating people's brains 
anyway. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  We've even debunked it here on this Crummy
Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR): [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/ivermectin-bitterman-published/),
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/ivermectin-revenant/), and
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/ivermectin-takedowns/).  

But right-wingers are _still_ trying to make us pretend ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine
are good for COVID-19, in their fascist fables of medicine.  Their latest outrage, pointed
out by Missouri activist Lindsey Simmons, is a _gag order explicitly forbidding
pharmacists from discussing specifically ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine:_  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Specifically, "a pharmacist shall not contact the prescribing physician or the patient
	to dispute the efficacy of ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets for human
	use..." unless the doctor or patient specifically asks.

She's referring to bill HB 2149 <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> whose text, upon checking,
says exactly that:  
- It starts out, bizarrely enough, talking about licensing physical therapists.  But then
  it went into conference committee. The resulting tug of war stuck all sorts of crap
  all over it.  
- Since apparently they know ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine _don't work for COVID-19_,
  they carved out an exception forbidding the licensing boards from taking any action
  against a pharmacist who fills a scrip for them.  In spite of the fact that
  _they don't work for COVID-19_.  
- Even more Orwellian, there is a __gag order:__ pharmacists are _forbidden from discussing
  the effects of specifically ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine_ unless the patient thinks
  to ask.  This is _explicitly in conflict with the code of ethics for pharmacists_, which
  is always to discuss medications with patients to make sure they take them properly
  (documented by Simmons in the Twitter thread above with extracts from the Missouri code
  of ethics for pharmacists).  In the case of ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine for
  COVID-19, the proper way to take them is _not to take them at all!_  

## A Bitter Irony  

The motto of the state of Missouri is:   

> Salus populi suprema lex esto  
>  
> (Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law)  

But now, apparently Missouri Republicans want the supreme law to be deference to fascist
medical fables, and the lives of mere people be damned.
