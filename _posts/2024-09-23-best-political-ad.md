I just saw The Best Political Ad Ever.  Most of them are terrible, but this one is warm,
artful, and competent.  


## Ok, Political Ads?  Really?!

Yes, I know about political ads.  They are uniformly and drearily low-brow.  They're
always trying to make you angry or afraid.  The Republican ones also want you to hate
scary brown-skinned people who might wish to become your neighbors.

So against that background, I was actually _delighted_ to see this one from Tim Walz.  He
makes a few remarks about the general incompetence billionaires in general and Trump in
particular, sure.  

But most of it is about him working on his car: a 1979 International
Harvester Scout.  No computers, everything analog.  He explains how the cruise control is
his latest problem, and that it works using air pressure against a weight to be accurate
to within a mile/hr or two.  

Also, it's titled "The Manual", i.e., the maintenance manuals that used to come with cars
and would tell you everything you needed to know to fix it.  

Now, over a number of years in software development and later as a scientist specializing
in applied statistics, "Read the Manual" was sort of my mantra.  People will go to
_enormous_ efforts to avoid doing this, in fact expending far more energy than simple
manual-reading would take.  Once, when somebody asked how I knew so much Lisp Machine
lore, I pointed to the _Encyclopaedia Symbolica_
([here's someone's attempt to preserve some of it](https://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/symbolics/software/genera_8/);
no idea how complete it is compared to the hardcopy now sitting on a shelf in my study) on
my shelf and noted that "If you read the manual, you'll end up knowing a lot of stuff."
(Also if you read the source, which was a thing we could do, back in those days.)  

So, in addition to being warm, artful, and competent: Coach Walz is also a manual-reading
sort of guy.  

Now I like him even more.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The heart of the matter, for US eligible voters:  
- Register to vote.  
  - Then check your voter registration, at least once a week until the election.
    ([Republican trickery to do mass de-registrations is all over the place.]({{ site.baseurl }}/voter-reg-2024/)
    Refuse to be a victim.)  
- Vote for Harris/Walz.  In fact, vote Democratic up and down the ticket:  
  - We need a Democratic Senate to get any judges confirmed (or any confirmations at
    all, really).  
  - We need a Democratic House to do anything else.  Unless you like federal government
    shutdowns, in which case I remind you that
    [a Republican House is the single best predictor of federal government shutdowns]({{ site.baseurl }}/springtime-for-shutdowns/).
    Maybe don't enable that?  
- And, as always, ya gotta respect the classics: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)  


## Addendum 2024-Sep-27: Ow! Ow!  You're making me wag my tail too hard!

Ok, look.  Tim.  Buddy.  You gotta take it down a notch here.  I already like you.  You
don't have to push my buttons _this_ hard!  

That subtle dig about JD Vance being unable to order donuts? <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
When you said "Look at me &ndash; I have no problem picking out doughnuts"&hellip; that
was _tight,_ man.  Well done.  

But when you shouted "Sold!" to the guy describing an apple cider donut cut in half
and filled with Whoopie Pie cream filling&hellip;  Dude, it's _maddening_ that I
can't figure out where to get such a thing in Boston.  Now I'm gonna have to look up
recipes for cream fillings.  

You do realize, don't you, that Candidate for Vice President is not typically this full of
_joie de vivre_?  Good job there, breaking the stereotypes: I didn't know a VP candidate
could be smart, competent, and _fun._
