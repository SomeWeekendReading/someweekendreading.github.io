The US stock market has become a crazy bet on AI and the regulators have been corrupted, so
it's time to make some defensive moves&hellip; _again._  


## Vanguard's New Portfolio Recommendation  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-fortune-1.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="Tully @ Fortune: Vanguard recommends lowers stock percent" title="Tully @ Fortune: Vanguard recommends lowers stock percent" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
This summer, _Forbes_ landed an interview with Vanguard's chief investment officer, Greg
Davis. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  This is a measure of how seriously Vanguard takes
this information: one does not get an interview like that easily, so Vanguard must really
_want_ to get the news out.  (Though, strangely, _Forbes_ spent a paragraph describing how
Davis was _dressed,_ as if that meant something.  I will _never_ understand why reporters
are just obsessed about The Narrative, trying to make everything about the personalities
of people with power.)  

They're lowering the percentage of US stocks they recommend in portfolios for a pretty
straightforward reason: stocks are expensive, as measured by P/E ratio or the even better
Shiller CAPE (cyclically averaged P/E ratio, also adjusted for inflation).  
- __The P/E ratio__ of a stock, or better yet and index, is the price to earnings ratio.
  Divide the price of a stock by the trailing 12 months of earnings (or your estimated
  earnings going forward, if you're daring).  
  
  This tells you how much you're paying to buy the earnings of the business.  A high P/E
  ratio (say, 20-30) means the stock is expensive compared to its earnings.  This might be
  because investors think there's a lot of growth possible, and that future earnings will
  be even higher.  But&hellip; still expensive.  
- __The Shiller CAPE, or Cyclically Adjusted P/E ratio,__ attempts to account for inflation
  and for the business cycle.  
  
  It looks back 10 years, inflation-adjusting all the earnings and averaging them.  The 10
  year lookback means you're asking about the performance of the stock over (usually) an
  entire business cycle.  
  
  With the 10 year lookback, CAPE is more data hungry than the simpler P/E ratio, which
  makes Wall St types impatient with it.  

Davis says Vanguard's models predict the next decade will average about 1/3 of the returns
in the previous decade:  

> "Our investment strategy group's projection is that U.S. equity market returns are going
> to be much more muted in the future," Davis warns. "Over the past ten years, the S&P
> returned an average of 12.4% annually. We’re predicting the figure to drop to between 3.8%
> and 5.8% (midpoint of 4.8%) over the next decade."  

Is the high CAPE ratio a reasonable concern?

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-morningstar-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-morningstar-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="278" alt="Rekenthaler @ Morningstar: Redoing Finke's study with Morningstar data shows CAPE still works" title="Rekenthaler @ Morningstar: Redoing Finke's study with Morningstar data shows CAPE still works" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
It appears so.  

Finance professor Michael Finke did a study <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> which was
picked up by John Rekenthaler at Morningstar a few years ago.<sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
Rekenthaler, showing admirable skepticism, redid Finke's regression using the
inflation-adjusted CAPE and inflation-adjusted stock market returns data from
Morningstar's own databases.  

As you can see from the plot, the fit is excellent.  Finke reports an $R^2 \sim 90\%$ or
better.  That's pretty astounding, given that it hasn't really worked _that_ well in
previous periods.  

As I write this, 
[the US CAPE ratio ("Shiller PE") stands at 40.30.](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)
Armed with that fact, look at the regression plot that predicts the next 10 years of
inflation-adjusted stock returns being _negative,_ and then tell me about your risk
appetite for stocks!  

Though, let's be fair: if CAPE went from previously not working to predict stocks to
working now, nothing prevents it from going back to not working in the next decade.  As 
[Yogi Berra is alleged to have said](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/quotes/#:~:text=Prediction%20is%20hard%2C%20especially%20when%20it%E2%80%99s%20about%20the%20future.%E2%80%9D),
"Prediction is hard, especially when it's about the future."  

So Davis says people who would normally have a 60/40 (60% stocks/40% bonds) portfolio should not
only rebalance, but rebalance to 40/60, leaning hard into bonds.  That's&hellip; _bold._  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-bi-1.jpg" width="400" height="192" alt="Edwards @ BI: Vanguard recommending 30/70 allocations" title="Edwards @ BI: Vanguard recommending 30/70 allocations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-bi-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-bi-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="344" alt="Vanguard's 30/70 portfolio, quoted in BI" title="Vanguard's 30/70 portfolio, quoted in BI" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
A couple weeks later, in August, _Business Insider_ ran a similar article <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>,
claiming Vanguard said:  
- Vanguard's models forecast 3.3% - 5.3% annual stock returns, vs 4% - 5% for bonds over
  the next 10 years.  
- People &ndash; like your humble Weekend Editor &ndash; who would normally prefer a 60/40
  portfolio should move to a 30/70 portfolio.  

So they ran the mighty Vanguard Capital Markets Model (VCMM) to estimate future returns
and their uncertainties, and they ran the equally mighty Vanguard Asset Allocation Model
(VAAM) to construct recommended portfolios.  The image here shows the results, tagged as
having come from a run on 2025-Jun-30.  It compares a 60/40 benchmark portfolio (top) with their
proposed 30/70 portfolio (bottom).  

Now&hellip; the _Fortune_ interview where they recommended 40/60 was published
2025-Jul-24, and this _Business Insider_ article recommending 30/70 was published
2025-Aug-06.  So it's just 2 weeks later, and they've gotten quickly _more_ defensive?
Why is the recommendation changing so rapidly, by such a large amount, and to an extremely
defensive position?  Do they know something the rest of us don't?  

It _could_ be that the picture darkened dramatically in the 2 weeks between these
publications.  But it also could be that the VCMM and VAAM are just very sensitive to the
input conditions, and don't produce stable outcomes.  In the latter case, it's important
not to be too fixated on the precise numbers, but rather to look at the general scenario:
very high CAPE valuations, reasonable returns on bonds, and therefore low equity risk
premia.  In that situation, it makes sense to tilt more toward bonds, though it's
debatable exactly how much.

So we decided to check at the original source <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, because
getting information filtered through journalists obsessed with The Narrative is frustrating.

Here we see Vanguard's updated portfolio, with data current as of 2025-Oct-31.  (Compare
the _Business Insider_ reporting using a Vanguard model run of 2025-Jun-30.)  They've gone
back to a 40/60 recommendation, which is quite a bit less extreme than the scary 30/70
allocation.  

Interestingly, there's also some helpful information on suballocations, i.e.,
tilting the stocks toward value (away from high-P/E growth stocks), and small cap (away
from the Magnificent 7 big tech stocks).  I found that gratifying, because for many years
I've been using Vanguard's US small-cap value index fund and international small-cap fund
for that exact purpose.  Now even Vanguard is cautioning people not to lean to heavily on
US large-cap growth stocks.  

Also gratifying, for a quantitative old nerd like your humble Weekend Editor, is the
inclusion of a table of portfolio characteristics.  The table compares the 40/60
portfolio with the "benchmark" 60/40:  
- On the second line, we see that the standard deviation of returns is about 1/3 less,
  which we would expect from a larger bond allocation.  
- But on the first line, we see that the mean returns are within a few 10ths of a percent
  of each other (5.5% vs 5.2%) and _slightly higher_ for the bond-heavy portfolio!  So
  this is about earning roughly the same, just with far, far less volatility.  I'm
  starting to like this plan!   
- As risk measures, consider the 3rd &amp; 4th lines:
  - The Sharpe ratio is the return beyond the risk-free rate, divided by the amount of
    risk:  
	
	$$
	S = \frac{E[R] - R_f}{\sigma[R]}
	$$
	
	That means it measures the amount of additional return you get for each unit of risk
	you take.  Higher is better.  
	
	The 40/60 portfolio is at 0.33, while the 60/40 benchmark is at 0.18.  So the 40/60 is
	a _more efficient risk taker_, getting more return for the risk it takes.  
  - The max drawdown is how much the portfolio might go down, peak to trough.  Closer to 0
    is better.  We see here the max drawdown is only about 1/3 of that for the 60/40 portfolio!
    Again, that's to be expected with bonds, but it's nice to see a projection of the
    protection.  
- Finally, on the last line of the table, is the thing I always want to see in any
  statistical model: what's the probability this will work?  Without that, I always wonder
  if somebody just forgot, or if they're hiding it.  Vanguard says there's a 47% chance
  the 40/60 portfolio will underperform the 60/40.  Ok, it would be nice to see that
  lower.  
  
  But, really: a null hypothesis would say that the portfolios are the same, and the
  probability of underperformance would be 50%.  The fact that it's 47% is very close to
  that, and says _this is about volatility reduction, not return maximization!_  
  
So all of that looks pretty sensible to me.  

One other thing to check, just to make sure we've nailed everything down tightly, is
exactly what the VCMM projections of market returns were, and how they differ from other
predictions by people who _aren't_ urging this much caution.  

So we looked at Vanguard's report on the VCMM run of 2025-Oct-31 <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
and what Morningstar's financial analysts came up with <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> as
a part of their recommendations on retirement withdrawal rates.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-vanguard-4.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="Vanguard Capital Markets Model, 2025-Dec-10" title="Vanguard Capital Markets Model, 2025-Dec-10" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-vanguard-5.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-vanguard-5-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="612" alt="Vanguard Investment Strategy Group: 10-year annualized forecasts for various asset classes" title="Vanguard Investment Strategy Group: 10-year annualized forecasts for various asset classes" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
First consider Vanguard (click through on these charts to see them full-size):  
- __Method:__ Vanguard's forecast is a sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation, done by
  people whom I think are some of the best available.  It's estimating annualized returns
  over the next 10 years.  
- __Stocks:__ The stock market return forecasts are in the blue bars at the top of their
  chart.  
  - Note that most of them are in the range of 3% - 5%, no more.  
  - US Large Growth is the most miserable sector.  
  - Things are much brighter if you tilt toward value stocks, small stocks, and ex-US
    international stocks, which are not so over-priced.  So tilting to small-cap and value
    stocks, and strongly tilting to outside the US makes perfect sense.  
- __Bonds:__ The bond market return forecasts are in the yellow bars at the bottom of
  their chart.  
  - First, note that these bond returns are _in every way comparable to the stock returns!_
    If you could get returns comparable to stocks while not having to take stock-like risk, 
    wouldn't you accept that bargain?  
  - Second, Vanguard tends to like total bond market funds, including corporates.  Here at
    Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, we tend to like US Treasuries, TIPS, and foreign government
    bonds (with a currency hedge back to the dollar).  

    As we've previously written here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads 
    (CLBTNR) <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>, corporate bonds look like a Treasury bond
    with a small amount of stock market risk added.  If you're trying to diversify away
    from some stock risk, you can't do that by adding more stock.  Hence our choice of
    bonds will be a bit more restrictive than Vanguard's (_q.v._).  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-morningstar-3.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="Arnott, Benz, and Kephart: Morningstar projections" title="Arnott, Benz, and Kephart: Morningstar projections" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-morningstar-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-morningstar-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="248" alt="Morningstar projected returns for various asset classes, 2024 &amp; 2025" title="Morningstar projected returns for various asset classes, 2024 &amp; 2025" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Now compare with Morningstar:  
- __Method:__ Morningstar is making a 30 year forecast, since they're doing it for projecting retirement
  spending levels.  They don't quite say what they did, except to say it's got a "top-down"
  portion from things like valuations and earnings growth rates and a "bottom-up" phase
  involving human input from their equity analysts.  They're a bit more traditional in that
  regard than Vanguard, for better or worse. (Mostly worse, I think, given that equity
  analysts can be crowd followers as much as anybody else.  But it's a point of comparison
  to Vanguard.)  
- __Stocks:__ Note that their forecasts for stock returns (30 years, vs Vanguard's 10
  years) are _seriously_ higher, at 8% - 12%.  That's more of a "business as usual"
  forecast, not one that is aware of the high CAPE and the rampant political instability
  &amp; corruption.  Maybe they think in 30 years none of that will matter?  
- __Bonds:__ Morningstar's bond predictions look to be pretty much in line with
  Vanguard's.  
- __Safe withdrawal rates vs equity percent:__ You might think that if Morningstar
  analysts think stocks are having such high returns, they'd recommend more stocks in
  their retirement portfolios, right?  
  
  Not so: they figure out the withdrawal rates a portfolio will support, with 90%
  probability of not running out of money, as a function of stock percent.  For a 30 year
  period, this maxes out for portfolios between 30% stock and 50% stock!  
  
  It's somewhat surprising that this result is so low, given their rather sunny forecast.
  But it's just realistic: if you must sustain withdrawals for decades, then the
  volatility of a high stock portfolio tends to kill you.  Or at least bar you from
  getting their 90% success rates.  
  
So while Morningstar forecasts much higher stock returns than Vanguard, they both come out
with similar portfolio recommendations for sustainability looking forward 10 years or 30
years.  

Again, this makes perfect sense to me.


## What We Did  

As we've written previously on this CLBTNR about the Weekend Portfolio 
<sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>,
our neutral policy portfolio would be the good ol' 60/40 stock/bond allocation.  However,
high valuations and catastrophic political destruction had forced us to get more
conservative at a 50/50 stock/bond allocation.  We even increased our ex-US stock and bond
holdings.  

Now, Vanguard and &ndash; in a different way &ndash; Morningstar have pushed me to think
that this might not have been enough.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-portfolio-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-portfolio-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="331" alt="New portfolio: tax location and major asset class allocation" title="New portfolio: tax location and major asset class allocation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-portfolio-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-01-02-weekend-portfolio-trump-3-portfolio-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="New portfolio: specific fund allocations" title="New portfolio: specific fund allocations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The question is, how much?  We saw above that Vanguard's allocation recommendations swung
from 30/70 to 40/60 over just a couple weeks.  So the important thing is to take the
general advice that bonds have better prospects, and allocate a portfolio we can live
with.  I settled on 40% stocks, 60% bonds.  
- __Tax location:__ As you can see, the tax-free (Roth IRA) component has increased a
  bit.  That's because all the stuff likely to grow faster is in the Roth, with only bonds
  in the Trad IRA.  Also, we're continuing our campaign of doing annual partial Roth
  conversions, to get as much money put in the tax-free part of the portfolio before RMDs
  begin.  That is, we're _diversifying the tax structure_ of the portfolio at the same time
  as the rst of this.  
- __Overall allocation:__ 40% stocks/60% bonds.  
- __US/International stock allocation:__ 40% US/60% international.  This applies both to
  stocks in general and to REITs.  It amounts to a moderate bias_away from the US._  
- __US/International bond allocation:__ 50% US, equally between intermediate Treasuries
  and TIPS, and 50% international.  The international bonds are mostly government bonds of
  developed nations, with a currency hedge back to the dollar, as Vanguard recommends.  
- __Tilts:__ We tilt fairly heavily away from US Large Growth stocks, in favor of US small
  value stocks, international small stocks, and REITs both US and international (another
  form of value stock, really).  

I think that covers the bases:  
- adjust the stock/bond ratio to be more in favor of bonds,  
- tilt to small, value, and international stocks,  
- have a large portion of international developed nation government bonds,  
- continue to do partial Roth conversions to get a little more tax armor.  

## The Weekend Conclusion  

Vanguard's market forecasts are pretty dim, and bonds are offering pretty good competition
with reasonable returns and less risk.  The US CAPE ratio is currently quite high, at 40.30.  Those
2 facts combine to lower the equity risk premium and lower the expectation of stock
returns.  

Tanking up on bonds _just makes sense,_ particularly for a retiree who is in the
capital preservation phase of life.  

Look, I'm not saying it's time to run for the hills and lay in a supply of food and
water.  And this _extremely_ conservative (for me) portfolio is not the way I'd invest in
normal times.  But these are decidedly not normal times.
