[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tag/SomebodyAskedMe) (really it's the same "somebody" behind all of these) about the Moderna
COVID vaccine phase 3 start.  Basically, it looks like the start of a reasonably designed
Phase 3 trial: the beginning of a long slog to test safety &amp; efficacy.

_How to volunteer:_ See the good folk at the [coronavirus prevention network](https://www.coronaviruspreventionnetwork.org/). Trial sites are all around the US concentrated in cities, one of them my home.  Somewhat of a puzzle to me that all sites are in the US, not internationally?!  Who even _does_ that nowadays?  I imagine it will fill up fast -- I asked the Weekend Editrix if we should volunteer, and got a somewhat equivocal response.  

## Some Details

A few details from reading the clinical trial registry entry:  

* ~30k volunteers.  
* Complex inclusion/exclusion criteria, but basically over 18 and unlikely to get
pregnant.  A few things about not taking immunosuppressants, not having had COVID-19, not
having had terrible reactions to vaccines in the past, etc.  But basically a broad
population, including those with relevant pre-existing conditions (as is relevant here in
an _efficacy_ trial, no longer a _safety_ trial).  Eligibility criteria [here on ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04470427#eligibility).   
* 2 injections, on days 1 and 29.  Presumably some blood draws, on days of injection and assessment days, but I didn't read deeply enough to find out how many.  (Nope, I take it back -- Time Frame: Day 1, Day 29, Day 57, Day 209, Day 394, and Day 759.  So not bad -- only 6 blood draws.  I thought there would be more!)  
* Placebo controlled.  Placebo is a saline injection.  (I'm slightly surprised they don't
give you something to induce mild fever and aches, so you won't know which arm of the
trial you're in.  Because _everybody_ gets aches &amp; pains &amp; fever in Phases 1 &amp; 2.  Perhaps a
flu vaccine in the control arm?  For example, in a trial for ketamine injections to treat depression, where I had a personal interest a couple years ago, the control arm gets an unrelated benzodiazepine, so they'll feel woozy and not know which arm of the trial they're in.)  
* Quadruple blinded: participant, caregiver, investigator, and data analyst.  They're being _verrry_ careful, which warms the heart of this skeptical, flinty, grizzled old statistician.  (Well, not exactly _warm_-hearted, but slightly less cold than usual.)  
* Preliminary readout at end of October 2020, but official monitoring for 759 days (basically 2 years) for absolute final readout (so something like July 2022, but thumbs up/down for at least _initial_ FDA approval likely by end of this year or early next year; apparently Lonza &mdash; Moderna's partner &mdash; is already doing at-risk manufacturing mostly in Switzerland).  

I'd have been interested in volunteering if the Weekend Editrix had said ok, but for now with "ambiguous" health insurance status at least for a while, maybe it's not the time for me to be confusing our rather cruel &amp; arbitrary health care delivery system.  

Unsurprisingly, as of a couple days after that announcement, there were over 100,000 volunteers for this 30,0000 person trial.  They'll pick a subset to ensure diversity over pre-existing condition, age, body mass index, gender, race, and so on.  Probably little chance to get in, should you still be interested at this point.  

## Multiply-Blinded, Placebo Controlled Design

What's remarkable is the number of times when designs are _not_ thoughtful, when the MDs running the trial think they have no need of a statistician to design the experiment.  (Of course, I'm a grizzled old statistician, so I would say that, wouldn't I?)  

For example, this trial -- [NCT01920555](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01920555)
-- looks at the use of ketamine for rapid treatment of major depressive disorder.  I have
both a personal interest in depression, and I also know some of the people involved
(mainly the research anesthesiologist who had to administer the doses was a good friend,
so alas, I couldn't volunteer).   But to make sure subjects couldn't tell which arm of the
trial they were in, they gave ketamine to the treatment arm and midazolam (unrelated
benzodiazepine) to the control arm.  Everybody gets to feel a little woozy for 30min or
so, and the average person off the streets can't tell the difference.  (Probably an
anesthesiologist _could_ tell the difference, as could a ketamine abuser, but they wouldn't recruit such a subject.)  

This was an example of a good design.  

An earlier trial of ketamine -- [NCT00088699](https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00088699) -- was a mediocre design: the placebo was "an inactive substance", probably saline.  So subjects could _probably_ tell the difference, if they knew what ketamine was (and anybody in a trial would probably look it up).  They tried to compensate with a crossover design, where at the second dose they swapped treatment and control arms -- so every subject got 1 treatment and 1 control dose.  But by the second dose, I bet the subjects could _definitely_ tell which was which!  

This sort of thing makes research statisticians sad.  But it very defiitely _doesn't_ seem
to be a pitfall with the Moderna/Lonza COVID trial.  So good on them.
