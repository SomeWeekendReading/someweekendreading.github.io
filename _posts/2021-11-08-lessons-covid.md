COVID-19 has taught us some lessons about (a) how mind-numbingly stupid and corrupt we can
be, and (b) some forms of corruption that are so confusing that I can't tell if they are 
[the divine madness]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#TheDivineMadness) or instead just 
[&Gammad;&Tau;&Phi;]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#ϜΤΦ).  


## Some people react to stress with corruption  

There's no question COVID-19 had stressed us all.  And by _all_, I mean _humanity_, not
just Americans.  People respond to stress in different ways: sometimes admirably rising to
the occasion, and sometimes descending into chaos and corruption.  

Today some examples of the latter slithered into my awareness.  


### Lesson 1: Why are all the ivermectin studies misdesigned, inconclusive, or outright fakes?  

Ashish Jha, Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, has an interesting
question for us today:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    So frustrating<br><br>

    Why do these &quot;mix-ups&quot; keep happening to Ivermectin studies?<br><br>

    I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence that so many of these studies
	highly touted on Twitter and Facebook end up getting retracted

Yes, that is an _excellent_ question.  Ivermectin, and before it hydroxychloroquine, were
the "miracle medications" that the Trumpsters swore up and down were a safe, easy, and
cheap cure for COVID-19.  People believed that, and then they died.  

Now, ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine are perfectly reasonable drugs &ndash; in the
applications for which they are known to work.  Those applications are invertebrate
parasite infestations and malaria, respectively. Neither of them has _anything_ to do with
COVID-19.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-08-lessons-covid-ivermectin-retraction.jpg" width="400" height="188" alt="Medscape Retraction Watch: Ivermectin study retracted" title="Medscape Retraction Watch: Ivermectin study retracted" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So why are the studies of real COVID-19 therapies like vaccines and molnupiravir so
ethically squeaky clean, whereas the Republican-amplifed crap around ivermectin and
hydroxychloroquine is medically useless and scientifically corrupt?  Today came news from
_Retraction Watch_ that the study they all cite about ivermectin has been 
retracted. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  
- The forensic journalism by the BBC, quoted in _Retraction Watch_, initially found that
  the data was _clearly faked:_ there were big blocks of patient data that had been copied
  &amp; pasted repeatedly, i.e., some of the patients didn't even exist.  The authors
  admitted it was "rigged, sabotaged, or mistakenly entered" &ndash; their exact words.  
- However, in their official retraction, they admitted no such thing.  They claimed what
  got submitted was a file of data meant to "train a research assistant" instead of the
  real data.  They claim this was an 'innocent mistake'.  They also claim the results
  still hold up, but have not released any data or analyses to support that claim.  
  
Fishy as hell.  Nobody should believe a single word of what they say, even if they
resubmit a "corrected" article, until _some other research group independently confirms_
the result.  Their credibility is pretty much trash now.  

This is why you don't take medical advice from right-wing political actors.  Ever.  


### Lesson 2: Vaccines in Greece and how doctors respond  

From Greece comes word of an interesting moral quandry:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    In Greece, antivaxxers have been paying doctors 400 euros to give them shots of
	bacteriostatic water instead of th 
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#COVID19</a>
	vaccine.<br><br>

    Except the doctors have been pocketing the money and giving them the
	real shot anyway: <a href="https://t.co/cAX9fbmDW6">https://t.co/cAX9fbmDW6</a>

</blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-08-lessons-covid-greece.jpg" width="400" height="340" alt="Greece: Drs take 400 euro bribes to vaccinate with water, give real vaccine instead" title="Greece: Drs take 400 euro bribes to vaccinate with water, give real vaccine instead" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Apparently vaccine defiance has reached a fever pitch in Greece: instead of taking a free,
safe, and effective vaccine people are sometimes attempting to bribe a doctor to 'vaccinate'
them with water. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

Now, I've worked with several Greek reserach scientists and doctors.  They were, to a
fault, extremely competent, reliable, and funny.  I really liked them.  But this
news&hellip; I just don't know _what_ to think:  
- On the one hand: people stupidly spending good money on a bribe for a fake vaccine card
  is regrettably&hellip; well, not exactly _understandable_, but at least familiar.  
- On the other hand: this puts the doctors and nurses doing the vaccinating in an
  interesting and frustrating 3-way bind:  
  - If they outright refuse the bribe, then something annoying happens where they probably
    have to call the cops.  Nobody wants cops in their clinic.  Plus, cops probably shut
    the place down for the rest of the day, depriving other people of their vaccinations.
    So nothing good happens down that path (aside from discouraging bribery, which I admit
    is important!).  
  - If they take the bribe and give the water sham vaccination, they've just practiced
    _corrupt_ medicine and damaged public health and likely the health of their patient.  No
    bribe is worth that.  
  - If they take the bribe and vaccinate for real anyway, they've practiced _bad_ medicine by
    administering treatment without proper consent.  The patient could later sue them (though
    only by admitting they had attempted bribery, so _that's_ unlikely).  
	
The last course avoids cops in the clinic, doesn't damage public health, and only
causes legal exposure to somebody attempting to sue them for not honoring illegal bribery.
So apparently that's the way out: take the bribe, and vax 'em anyway.  In some ways,
everybody gets what they deserve: a small bonus for the medical folk, and a vaccine for
the deluded patient.  It's just&hellip; _lacking in consent_ that bugs me.  

I just don't know how to feel about this.  I both want to laugh and cry, simultaneously.  

I honestly don't know what I would do in that situation.  What would you do?  


###  Lesson 3: The example of Japan says we could have done much better  

Instead of responding constructively to COVID-19, some of us engage in mask resistance, vaccine
defiance, corrupt studies &amp; conspiracy thinking around ivermectin, and a general
pretense that this isn't a big deal (at least not for right-wing manly men):  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    For people who tell me the average mortality rate for COVID is less than 2%, so what’s
	the big deal, I have two questions:<br><br>

    1) What is 2% of 330 million Americans? (6.6 million)<br><br>

    2) What percentage of Americans died in World War II? (0.32%) In the Civil War? (2.5%)

I remind you that the American Civil War was _also_ fought because the conservative and
more or less fascist American South wanted a culture war to resist moral change (in that
case, so they could remain _slavers_).  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-08-lessons-covid-japan.jpg" width="400" height="234" alt="Reuters Japan: First day of 0 COVID-19 deaths in last 15 months" title="Reuters Japan: First day of 0 COVID-19 deaths in last 15 months" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Consider, the better example of Japan, currently at 73.6% fully 
vaccinated <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>.  They're actually doing rather well right
now.  In fact, they've done very well:  
- The US has 330 million people, and so far over 750,000 deaths (227.27 dead per 100,000).  
- Japan has 125 million people, and so far only 18,000 deaths (14.40 dead per 100,000).  

That means the US/Japan risk ratio says we in the US have almost _16 times more risk than Japan:_  

$$
\mbox{Risk Ratio} = \frac{227.27}{14.40} = 15.78
$$

TBD: And yeah, I oughta calculate 95% confidence limits on that, using the fancy new
[beta ratio stuff that I've been working on]({{ site.baseurl }}/beta-ratios/), right?  But
for now, let's do the usual crude binomial confidence interval we've been using as a
stopgap measure until I get my brain in gear on numerics of ${}\_{3}F\_{2}()$ in the
large parameter regime:  

```R
> library("gsDesign")
Loading required package: xtable
Loading required package: ggplot2
> nUS  <- 330000000; nUSDead  <- 750000
> nJPN <- 125000000; nJPNDead <-  18000
> round((nUSDead / nUS) / (nJPNDead / nJPN), digits = 2)
[1] 15.78
> round(ciBinomial(nUSDead, nJPNDead, nUS, nJPN, scale = "RR"), digits = 2)
  lower upper
1 15.55 16.02
```

We conclude that for COVID-19 deaths compared to Japan, the US has 15.78 times the risk
(95% confidence limit: 15.55 &ndash; 16.02).  So&hellip; yeah, we're _pretty darn sure_
the US has about 16 times the COVID-19 death rate of Japan.  

Compared to the US, Japan is doing _fantastic!_  Everybody wears a mask, because that's
_customary_ when you have even a cold, to prevent spreading it to others.  And their vax
uptake was initially slow because of silly bureaucratic reasons, but after that it sped 
right up.  

Result:

Wouldn't you rather live in a society like that?  Wouldn't you rather _behave_ in a way that
we collectively _make_ a society like that?
