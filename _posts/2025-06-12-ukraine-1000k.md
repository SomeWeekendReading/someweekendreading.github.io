Russian dead in Ukraine: 1,000,000.  I hardly know what to say.  


## How We Got Here

Yes, we've been writing, here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), about
the outrage in Ukraine for quite a while now.
<sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
<sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup> <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>
<sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>
<sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup> <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>
But the thing is&hellip; the outrage just _keeps going on and on,_ beyond the bounds of
sanity for even the most power-obsessed dictator.  

We've been using the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence's figures for Russian casualties.  Of
course, one could object that they are a biased source.  But when we looked at other
sources, they were kind of in the middle of the pack.  Some sources were wildly inflated,
while others had extremely hard to believe small numbers.  (The latter were institutions
that insisted on a very high standard of evidence, like geo-location, identities,
photographs, and so on.  This leads to a very severe under-count, so people usually take
their estimates and apply a multiplier derived&hellip; somehow.)  The Ukraine MoD says
they _count_, every day.  That might even be true.  But they seem reasonably credible
compared to others, and they are the ones on the spot.  So we'll take their figures.  

Today, sadly, it appears that Russian casualties have reached the 1 million mark:  

<a href="https://x.com/DefenceU/status/1933028255767941303"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-12-ukraine-1000k-ukrmod-1.jpg" width="550" height="619" alt="Ukrainian Ministry of Defence @ X/Twitter: Russian casualties reach 1 million" title="Ukrainian Ministry of Defence @ X/Twitter: Russian casualties reach 1 million" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>
They've blown a hole in the demographics of Russia: as we calculated before when the
casualties hit 700k, this is around 4% of the population of Russian males of military
age:  

$$
144\ \mbox{million Russians} \times 0.5\ \mbox{males} \times 1/3\ \mbox{military age} = 23.7\ \mbox{million}
$$

&hellip;so 1 million dead is _approximately 4.2% of that generation of Russian men._ (See
[700k post on mortality statistics]({{ site.baseurl }}/ukraine-700k/#:~:text=WorldOMeter%20estimates%20the%20Russian%20population%20as%20of%20today%20at%20144%2C535%2C500.)
for sources, mainly WorldOMeter for population &amp; Wikipedia for demographic mortality curve.)  

I've seen estimates that a comparable number (ca. 900,000) Russian men of military age
have prudently left Russia to live in other countries.  That would just about double the
demographic hole to _about 8% of Russian men ages 18-44 being dead or absent._  

Again, a slight misquote of Bertrand Russell is in order:

## Comparison Against Our Casualty Rate Model  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-12-ukraine-1000k-regress-DayNum1000k-on-Soldiers.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-12-ukraine-1000k-regress-DayNum1000k-on-Soldiers-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Russian casualties in Ukraine vs time; regression model trained on first 100ish days of war, more recent casualties in red" title="Russian casualties in Ukraine vs time; regression model trained on first 100ish days of war, more recent casualties in red" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Alas, our [regression model of Russian casualties that we built on the first 116 days of the war.]({{ site.baseurl }}/russian-casualty-data-update3/)
remains sadly relevant:  
- Shown here is the plot of casualties (vertical axis) versus time in days since start of
  the war (horizontal axis).  
- In the lower left you see the first 116 days of casualties, up to 200,000 dead in blue
  points.  
- The regression fit to those first 116 days is the dashed line, while the 95% confidence
  limits and prediction limits are shown in gray bands around it. (If you don't
  quite grasp what those mean, the practical import is that the regression model is very
  good and provides relatively tight predictions.)  
- In the upper right you see in red dots the more recent data (450k, 500k, 600k, 700k,
  800k, 900k, and now 1,000,000 dead) plotted against the model trained on the data with
  less than 200k dead.  
  - The practical import of that is we can compare casualty rates now versus those at the
    beginning of the war.  
  - The red dots are:  
    - _Above_ the trend line,  
    - _Statistically significantly_ above it (outside the gray bands).  
- For a while there appeared to be some evidence that the red dots were supralinear, i.e.,
  Russian deaths were increasing faster than linearly in time, or _accelerating._  This no
  longer looks to be the case, since we have enough of the red dots to see that
  they're sort of linear.  It just appears that, around day 400 of the war, the Ukrainians
  got really good at causing more Russian casualties.  Or perhaps the Russians started
  resorting to human wave, meat grinder attacks.  (In the 800k post, we showed some
  evidence pointing to improved Ukrainian tactics being at the root of the death rate increase.)  

__Conclusion:__ Russians are _still_ dying faster than at the beginning of the war.


## From _The Economist:_ The Economics of Causing Deaths in Your Own Population  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-10-ukraine-1000k-economist-1.jpg" width="400" height="418" alt="International | Deathonomics @ The Economist: Putin's sickening statistic" title="International | Deathonomics @ The Economist: Putin's sickening statistic" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
A couple weeks ago, there was an informative article in
_The Economist_ <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup> anticipating today's sad progress mark
of 1,000,000 Russian dead.  

First, it appears that the Russian population is unsurprisingly, but aggressively,
propagandized by the Putin r&eacute;gime:  
> &hellip; convincing most Russians that they are engaged in a war against an imperialistic NATO
> and that there is glory in death, with increasingly lavish contracts for those willing to
> sign up.  

That's certainly consistent with the 
[Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) idea having taken
firm root in the minds of Russian leadership.  

The problem, of course, is how everybody _else_ deals with a nation that does not value
the lives of its citizens:  
> Yet Russia’s ability to shrug them off and to keep recruiting men to throw into
> meat-grinder attacks ought to also pose sobering questions for NATO’s European members:
> how can democracies that value the individual deter an adversary so unconcerned about
> the lives of its soldiers that it will sacrifice them, year after year, in a punishing
> war of attrition?  

They've coined the term 'deathonomics' for Putin's ideological militarization of Russia,
basically printing money to buy human sacrifices:  

> By the end of last year, according to Elena Racheva, a Russian former journalist who is
> now a researcher at Oxford University, the signing on bonus had reached 1.19m roubles
> ($15,000), while the average annual pay for a contract soldier was between 3.5m and 5.2m
> roubles, or up to five times the average salary. If a contract soldier is killed, his
> family will receive between 11m and 19m roubles.  
> &hellip;  
> Mr Golts says that the impact can be seen in small towns across Russia where recruitment
> has been most brisk. New houses are being built, smarter cars are turning up on the
> streets, and nail bars and gyms are opening.  
> &hellip;  
> For the families of the dead and injured, huge payouts “alleviate&hellip; their grief, such as
> feelings of injustice &hellip; and allow society to avoid moral responsibility for the casualties
> and injuries they endure,” Ms Racheva wrote. In other words, the contract is not just
> between the soldier and the state. The question which nobody can answer is how long that
> contract will hold.  

Some other disturbing facts from _The Economist:_  
- __Scale:__ Russian casualties are on same scale as US losses in WWII, since the US population then
  was similar to Russia's today.  
- __Severely wounded:__ The ratio of severely wounded to killed is generally about 4:1, so
  we should expect there to be about 4,000,000 severely wounded Russians.  (I have some
  doubts here, since there is evidence that the Russian military isn't very good at combat
  search and rescue or medical evacuation.  The Ukrainians have been taking prisoner a lot
  of abandoned wounded Russian soldiers.)  
- __Ukrainian casualties:__  We don't have much on Ukrainian casualties, but in December
  last year Zelensky said they had 43,000 dead + 370,000 wounded Ukrainians total. 
  That's&hellip; startlingly low compared to Russia, and indicates a wounded:killed ratio
  of about 8.6:1, instead of 4:1.  So&hellip; no idea what to make of that.  
- __Technology:__  Drones today are like machine guns were in WWI.  Machine guns made
  infantry too expensive to use  until new tactics and machinery were brought to bear in
  WWI, like tanks.  What the counter to drones will be, nobody knows.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Psychopaths like Putin and Trump are seeking power through modern-day versions of the worship
of [Huītzilōpōchtli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu%C4%ABtzil%C5%8Dp%C5%8Dchtli).
and [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/).  

You just can't _believe_ they'll be that evil, so they can get away with it for such a
long time.  It's past time for the rest of us scream "Stop!" at both of them, and pull
their fangs with demonstrations, general strikes, slowdowns, document leaks, and all the
rest of the methods of nonviolent resistance.  

Such worship of [Moloch](http://localhost:4000/ukraine-700k/#the-weekend-conclusion) is
shameful.  Just as Moloch required sacrificing your children by burning them a red-hot
metal idol, so it is here.
