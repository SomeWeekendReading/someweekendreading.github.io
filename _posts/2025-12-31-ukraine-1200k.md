Let's check in again on the sad state of affairs in Ukraine.  


## The Human Sacrifice Goes On&hellip; and On&hellip; and On  

Here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), we've for some time been
having&hellip; _opinions_ about Ukraine.

As we've been saying for a couple years now, we're tracking the Russian casualty figures
provided by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence:

Regrettably, it now appears the Russian casualty figures are above 1.2 million dead (and
considerably more who are injured, many disabled for life):  

<a href="https://x.com/DefenceU/status/2004447261833753034"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-31-ukraine-1200k-ukr-mod-1.jpg" width="550" height="763" alt="Ukraine Ministry of Defence: More than 1,200,000 Russian dead" title="Ukraine Ministry of Defence: More than 1,200,000 Russian dead" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

(As you can see, the number of casualties is just a hair above 1.2 million on
2025-Dec-26.  Judging by the rate, it would have hit 1.2 million on about 2025-Dec-24.  I
missed that &ndash; holiday preparations, you know.  Since Musk has turned X/Twitter into
a Nazi bar, I refuse to have an account there and can't look back far enough to see.  But
this is close enough!)  

The hole being blown in the middle of the Russian demographic of 18-44 year old males,
i.e., those more or less qualified for military service, continues to be enlarged.  By our
reckoning:  

$$
144\ \mbox{million Russians} \times 0.5\ \mbox{males} \times 1/3\ \mbox{military age} = 24\ \mbox{million}
$$

So 1.2 million dead is about $100\% \times 1.2 \mbox{million} / 24 \mbox{million} = 5\%$
of the military-age male population.  

The Russian emigration and COVID-19 deaths (see previous post <sup>[[15]](#fn15)</sup>: 
900,000 men of military age emigrated and about 67,000 dead of COVID-19),
we get about an extra million, for a total loss of 2.2 million.  That's
$100\% \times 2.2 \mbox{million} / 24 \mbox{million}$, for a
total loss __about 9.17% of the Russian men of military service age.__

These are men who will never return to work in the Russian economy. Their children will
either grow up without fathers or not exist at all.  Many women in the middle demographic
of Russia will face the impossibility of finding husbands.  This is the sort of thing
that starts revolutions.  (Though in the case of Russia, one never knows: they've
tolerated worse in the past, when it comes to authoritarianism and mass deaths.)  

As always, Bertrand Russell never _quite_ said these exact words, but it's right on the mark:  

> "The mark of a civilized man is the capacity to read a column of numbers and weep."
> &ndash; often attributed to Bertrand Russell, who said things __like__ this if not __exactly__
> this, but would in any case almost certainly agree with the sentiment  

At the last Ukraine update on this CLBTNR, we said something that just encapsulates all
the venom and malevolence of Russian, US, and Israeli governments, along with the rise of
right-wing racist parties in Europe:  

> When we look at the deaths in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the deaths in Israel's
> invasion of Gaza, the wholesale dismantling of public health in the US in favor of
> superstition, summary military executions of people in boats in the Caribbean, and masked
> men kidnapping people from the streets of the US with no due process _at all_&hellip; it
> is arguable that we can no longer claim to be civilized. We are, perhaps, just clever barbarians?  
>  
> We have allowed right-wing populism turn us into vicious, superstitious, and venomously racist
> savages.  And somehow we have done this on a planet-wide basis.  

I _wish_ that didn't seem so accurate.  


## Comparison Against Our Casualty Rate Model  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-31-ukraine-1200k-regress-DayNum1200k-on-Soldiers.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-31-ukraine-1200k-regress-DayNum1200k-on-Soldiers-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Current soldiers killed vs day number, compared to initial regression model" title="Current soldiers killed vs day number, compared to initial regression model" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here's the updated plot, with all the depressing news:  
- Time is on the horizontal axis, for the first 1000 days of the Russian invasion.  
- Number of Russian soldiers reported dead by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence is on the
  vertical axis.  
- The blue points in the lower left are the initial training data, about 100ish days into
  the war.  The resulting regression is the dotted line and the gray uncertainty intervals
  around it.  Rather than rehash the $F$-statistic, let's just say the linear fit is
  excellent.  
- The red points in the center to upper right are new data, collected approximately every
  100,000 increment in casualties.  
  
Note that the new data points are all well above the initial regression line.  Sometime
around day 450 (2024-Apr-10), the Russian death rate went up by about 43%, from about 700/day to
about 1000/day.  Either:  

- the Ukrainians got smarter or more efficient at killing Russians, or 
- the Russians started human wave attacks that made cheap sacrifice of their newly recruited troops.  

(Or both, which is actually the most likely conclusion, to my mind.)  

The data is practically screaming for a segmented regression model with a hinge function,
which is unbearably fancy-pants language for "a line with a kink".  Perhaps next time I'll
do that, but I'm just too discouraged now.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

I used to wonder when we would awaken to the malevolent insanity and depraved indifference
of our times and our leaders.  

I no longer wonder that.  Now I wonder _if_ we will ever awaken.
