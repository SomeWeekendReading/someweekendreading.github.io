There's a new SARS-CoV2 variant.  How bad does it look?  Nobody _really_ knows, but it's
got the potential to be very, very bad.  


## So, nu?  

The next letter of the Greek alphabet available was &nu; (nu).  I had a whole raft of
jokes based on the
[Yiddish expresson "so, nu?"](https://forward.com/culture/12736/just-say-nu-01335/)
meaning something like "so, go on and tell me more?"  "So, nu?" is never going to be a
COVID-19 joke, more's the pity.  Sort of.  

The next letter after that in the Greek alphabet is &xi; (xi, or as we were taught in my
mis-spent youth, chsi).  Alas, there is a certain autocrat who might take unbrage at the
use of his family name for a virus originating in his country, especially when his
propaganda apparatus is pushing the story that SARS-CoV2 originated in America instead of
China.  No point in poking the dragon with a sharp stick, unless you have plans for what
to do after that.  

So&hellip; &omicron; (omicron) it is, then&hellip; according to the World Health
Organization's Technical Avisory Group (yes, it's really called the
"WHO TAG team"). <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  


## Our safari guide  

Having been deprived of our opportunity for humor, let's get down to business.  Our safari
guide in these matters is [your local epidemiologist](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com),
a.k.a. [Katelyn Jetelina](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/about). <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
She's a professor in the department of epidemiology at the University of Texas Health
Science Center at Houston, with a PhD in epidemiology &amp; biostatistics, and is an
editor of _BMJ_.  Ok, she's convinced me to listen.  (Feel free to make up your own jokes
about "epidemiologists going viral".  I'm still grumpy at being deprived of "so, nu?")  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-yle-1.jpg" width="400" height="83" alt="YLE: New concerning variant B.1.1.529" title="YLE: New concerning variant B.1.1.529" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
She posted yesterday about the Omicron variant. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  Let's go
through what she wrote, see what we can simplify, and examine her primary sources to see
if we can add anything of our own.  (Hint: Not much.  She's _good._  Really, really good.)  


## Where did this thing come from?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-b-1-1-529-lineage.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-b-1-1-529-lineage-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="196" alt="PANGO/NextStrain generated cladogram of SARS-CoV2 lineages" title="PANGO/NextStrain generated cladogram of SARS-CoV2 lineages" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

It's been given the name B.1.1.529, meaning it's a descendant of one of the very early
B.1.1 variants.  It is, in particular, _not_ a descendant of the more recent Delta
variant.  The only public cladogram I can find is the blurry one shown here (click to
embiggen). <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>   (The
[relevant PANGO/NextStrain servers](https://nextstrain.org/fetch/genome.ucsc.edu/trash/ct/subtreeAuspice1_genome_17ae0_cf96f0.json)
are not responding to me when I try to generate my own, probably because _every scientist
on the planet_ is asking them questions right now!)  

So let me attempt to guide us through this a bit:  
- Everything starts with the original Wuhan virus.  
- The horizontal axis is the number of mutations, increasing to the right.  
- When a new strain occurs, the mutations are compared to the existing strains to tell us
  where to put it into the tree, i.e., the parental strains from which it evolved.  This
  is all rule-based, i.e., nobody's making decisions here that might be biased.  
- The assigned name is generated by walking the tree, e.g., our boy today being called
  B.1.1.529 means it's one of many variants of B.1.1, which was a very early variant near
  the root of the tree.  
- The red line is 3 samples of the the Omicron variant.  __NB:__ Pay careful attention to
  how high up the tree it branches off!  It does _not_ branch of Delta, which would be
  somewhere up at the top of the plot.  Instead, it's a whole pile of mutations on top of
  one of the ancestral B.1.1 strains.  
  
It looks like somebody caught an older version of COVID-19 (which is less likely with
Delta in the wind, but still possible).  If this person were immunocompromised, then they
wouldn't be able to clear the virus for a long time.  So the virus just hung around in
their body, mutating, and mutating, and mutating&hellip;  

Et voila: Omicron!  It just has a boatload of mutations, making it quite different from
the other strains.  What will turn out to be important is _where_ those mutations occur,
and what they _do_.  


## But is it a _threat?_  

According to the WHO TAG team, possibly.  They've designated it a "variant of concern"
(VOC), which is what we named things like Delta.  The crucial questions are, in a world
where Delta is now almost the only SARS-CoV2 strain worth worrying about:  

1. Does it transmit more than Delta?  (If not, Delta will out-compete it; if so, it will
   out-compete Delta.)  
2. Does it cause more severe disease than Delta?  (If not, then at least it's less bad
   than Delta and may give partial immunity to Delta; if so, then we want to avoid it at
   all costs.)  
3. Does it evade current vaccines?  (If not, just push harder on getting people vaccinated
   _and boosted;_ if so, then we need a vaccine specific to Omicron &amp; possibly Delta
   also as soon as possible and _then get everybody re-vaccinated!_  Imagine how much fun
   that will be&hellip;)  
   
What's the evidence that any of those are issues?  Consider where the mutations in the
spike protein lie.  Here our primary informant is [Jeffrey Barrett](https://twitter.com/jcbarret),
CSO of Nightingale Health and leading the COVID-19 genomics issue at the Sanger
Institute.  He's classified them (click to view the entire table in the tweet, not the
cut off version here):  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">

</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

His explanations of the details of that table in following tweets are quite worth
reading, explaining in detail why each color is bad news.  But for now, let's go with
Jetelina's summary:  
- Red: Known bad. These are mutations seen in previous VOC's that have made the virus more
  deadly.  Just what we need, eh?  
- Purple: New mutations not seen in the wild, but _in vitro_ data suggest they might be
  bad.  
- Yellow: They're near an important site on the protein, but nobody knows what they do.  
- Blue: Never seen before, no lab data, nobody knows.  
- Green: Mutation seen lots of times before, basically fixed in the genome all the way
  back to 2020.  Nothing to worry about.  
  
Note there is _not much green in the list!_  Some of them are in important places where
vaccine-induced antibodies bind, and thus could muck up vaccine immunity.  Others are in
places like the receptor binding domain (RBD) that could make it stick better to the human
ACE2 receptor, and thus become more virulent.  Yes, those statements involve the modal
word "may", but they still make everybody queasy at the number of gambles being taken.

Jetelina quotes this slide from a video presentation by the South Africa Health Ministry.
(This is extremely early data; we don't have the actual slides, and are reduced to
YouTube screen scrapes!  Click to embiggen.)  They show where the mutations lie along the
sequence of the spike protein, and color the regions by the function of that particular
domain: NTD, RBD, S1/S2 furin cleavage site, a deletion characteristic of evading the
innate immune system, and some other junk associated in other variants with increased
infectivity.  

_All that together, in one viral package._  I do not like this.  At _all._  

Sure, we're gonna have to spend serious time and effort understandint what all those
gizmos do&hellip; but what are the chances they're mostly benign?  Not much, I think.  


## Some empirical data  

Ok, enough noodling around with genomic information that _might_ be bad.  Let's look at
what it's actually been _seen_ to do in South Africa.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-yle-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-yle-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="YLE: Increase in positive test rates in Gauten, South Africa, over 2 weeks" title="YLE: Increase in positive test rates in Gauten, South Africa, over 2 weeks" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Jetelina points us at this slide from the South African National Institute for
Communicable Diseases (NICD).  Note that in the Gauteng region (top right), positive test
rates went from 1% to 30%, _in two weeks!_  That's&hellip; _terrifyingly fast._  

So that's one bit of evidence in favor of increased infectiousness for Omicron.  

Now, to be sure, it's likely the population there is largely unvaccinated.  This is the
cost of vaccine inequity: we leave the developing world defenseless, and in the process of
being victims of SARS-CoV2 they become breeding grounds for variants that can come back
and kill the rest of humanity.  If it's not enough to make the moral argument that we
should all be each other's keepers, then pay attention to the selfish argument that you
don't want variants breeding and coming back to kill you.

The estimates from modeler [JPWeiland](https://twitter.com/JPWeiland) say that while Delta
is 70% more transmissible than SARS-CoV2 classic, Omicron appears to be 700% more
transmissible.  When you compare that with the share of sequenced cases in South Africa,
that number is about right.  Jetelina shows us this (approximated) graph from 
[John Burn-Murdoch](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch), chief data reporter at the very
pink _Financial Times_ (click to embiggen). Whatever's going on, Omicron is spreading
_more rapidly than Delta_, at least in a largely unvaccinated population.  

I haven't tried to fit a logistic curve like these guys have, because the data isn't out
yet.  But if they're even _mostly_ right, Omicron is spreading fast.  

__Conclusion:__ Omicron is very likely to be _more infectious than Delta._  


## Some good(?) news  

Jetelina points out 3 potentially good signs:  

1. Omicron can be distinguished from other variants by a PCR test, instead of requiring a
   sequencing machine.  
2. We've seen it very, very early and have a little bit of time to figure out what to do.
   The South Africans have been completely amazing and deserve our respect and gratitude.  
3. mRNA vaccines can be rapidly "reprogrammed" to make new proteins.  (Though
   manufacturing, distribution, and getting shots in arms are other matters, as we
   discovered to our sorrow this year.)  

   But people are estimating 6 weeks to do the mini-trial, then a week or so for the FDA
   &amp; CDC to approve/EUA it.  In an article today from NPR <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, 
   Moderna said it was working on booster vaccines anticipating mutations like Omicron,
   and is ramping up efforts on a Delta-specific and Omicron-specific vaccine; Pfizer and
   BioNTech said once they have enough information in the next 2 weeks, they could have
   Omicron boosters ready to ship in 100 days.  

So maybe we can fight it with vaccines&hellip; if people will _take_ the vaccines!  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

1. It's _important_ to protect the immunocompromised members of our community!  It's not
   just the moral thing to do, but it also is good for _everyone_ to prevent the
   occurrence of sources of mutations.  
2. For the same reason, it's _important_ for everybody to get vaccinated!  In Jetelina's
   words:  
   > Get vaccinated. Get boosted. Ventilate spaces. Use masks. Test if you have
   > symptoms. Isolate if positive. And encourage others to do the same.  
3. The crucial questions are, as above: 
   1. Does it transmit more than Delta?  
   2. Does it cause more severe disease than Delta?  
   3. Does it evade current vaccines?  
   
We should fervently hope the answers to all 3 of those questions are "no".  Otherwise,
we'll be breaking out the [Omicronomicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necronomicon).


## Addendum 2021-Nov-28: ZDogg MD's Omicron Opinion  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QxZ4Jmjtric"
allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen
style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
ZDoggMD (a.k.a. Dr. Zubin Damanya) weighed in with this video on omicron.  He and I don't
always agree: he's more cavalier about no mandates &amp; letting unvaccinated people stay
unvaccinated in spite of the damage to the healthcare system; he's more cautious about
advising masks; he wants more finely sliced advice on boosters; he's much more interested
in meditation&hellp; and so on.  But we _do_ agree that vaccination is the best policy.
He's much better at capturing the "story" that hooks people's interest, whereas I'm just
annoyed by "story".   

So basically he's a good, responsible doctor who is a good science and medical advice
communicator.  He covers most of the points about omicron that are relevant.  The crucial
questions are still the 3 questions above.  

For people who need to see a human face and hear advice in the form of a story, this is
as good a starting place as any.  Probably better.  


## Addendum 2021-Nov-29: Your Local Epidemiologist, Again  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-yle-3.jpg" width="400" height="108" alt="YLE: Omicron update" title="YLE: Omicron update" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Katelyn Jetelina, writing in her blog _Your Local Epidemiologist_, has now updated twice
on omicron. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  When an
epidemiologist starts offering you daily updates, _it's time to pay attention._  (As we used
to say in my lab: when the chemist is running away&hellip; _try to keep up._)  

She points us at the fact that the CDC has issued an Omicron
update <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>.  It's nice
to see that the CDC expressed gratitude to the South African government and scientists for
catching this so early and being transparent with their data.  (It's _really_ unfortunate
that the rest of the world is punishing them with travel bans, a severe disincentive to
good behavior in the future!)  The CDC's advice:  

> We know what it takes to prevent the spread of COVID-19. CDC recommends people follow
> [prevention strategies](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html) such as wearing a mask in public indoor settings in areas of
> substantial or high [community transmission](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/%22%20/l%20%22county-view), washing your hands frequently, and
> physically distancing from others. CDC also recommends that everyone 5 years and older
> protect themselves from COVID-19 by getting [fully vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html). CDC encourages a COVID-19
> vaccine booster dose for those who are eligible.  

There were a number of border closures today, including Japan and Israel.  Your humble
Weekend Editor would like to remind everyone of Your Local Epidemiologist's comments on
the ineffectiveness of border closures from 2021-Nov-26 <sup id="fn3a">[[3]]</sup>:  

> __Travel bans are not evidence-based:__ It may seem like travel bans for individual
> countries are a necessary step, but I cannot stress enough that they do not work. For
> example, we had a travel ban with China in March 2020, only to be infiltrated with a
> European strain. Travel bans are a political move; a tool to show the public that the
> government is responding. Travel bans can do a lot of damage, though, like perpetuate
> disease related stigma. This variant has already spread. A travel ban is not an
> evidence-based solution unless you stop all travel from every country.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-reuters.jpg" width="400" height="255" alt="Reuters: 61 / 600 arriving from SA test positive" title="Reuters: 61 / 600 arriving from SA test positive" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
One disturbing anecdote from _YLE:_ Reuters reports that in Amsterdam, 2 planes from South
Africa landed and all 600 passengers were tested.  61 came back positive, or about 10%
positive. <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> As if that's not sufficiently stupefying, _all
tested negative when they boarded the flight._ It is not yet known how many of those were
Omicron infections, or how many passengers were fully vaccinated.  The Dutch government
responded the same day with a complete ban on travel from South Africa, despite what we
now know about the uselessness of travel bans.  (Though travel bans on _unvaccinated_
people might make sense?)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-nature.jpg" width="400" height="305" alt="Nature: High genetic barrier to SARS-CoV2 escape from polyclonal antibodies" title="Nature: High genetic barrier to SARS-CoV2 escape from polyclonal antibodies" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Let's turn to the subject of whether Omicron might evade vaccines, given that it has 32(ish)
mutations in the spike protein with about half of them in the receptor-binding domain
(RBD).  Jetelina points us to an article in _Nature_ pointing out there is an upper limit
to the number of spike protein mutations a virus can have, before it no longer binds well
to its target ACE2 receptor.  

Basically, this is not your immune system's first rodeo: it knows a thing or two about how
to cope with mutations in infectious pathogens.  It generates lots of different
(polyclonal) antibodies to the spike protein.  In order to evade _all_ of those, the spike
protein would have to change so much it might not be able to bind to the ACE2 receptor in
your lungs any more.  Vaccine efficacy might be reduced, sure; it will almost certainly
not be eliminated.  Vaccines are still good, useful, and something you _should_ do.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-medrxiv.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="MedR&chi;iv: Boosters increase ab levels and diversity" title="MedR&chi;iv: Boosters increase ab levels and diversity" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Boosters not only raise the _number_ of antibodies, but also the _diversity_ of antibodies
to various spots on the spike protein. <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup> So it's
important to get a booster once you're eligible: you not only get short- to
intermediate-term increased immunity from antibodies, you also get long-term increased
immunity because your antibodies check more carefully for mutations in the spike protein,
giving broader immunity to variants.  That's _in addtion_ to antibody maturation, where
your immune system refines the antibodies over time to get better and better; your memory
B-cells are _busy._  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-moderna.jpg" width="400" height="102" alt="Moderna: variant-specific boosters" title="Moderna: variant-specific boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
And if all _that_ doesn't turn out to be enough, the mRNA vaccines can be modified quickly
(though getting them manufactured, purchased, distributed, and into arms is a very gnarly
problem we fought through earlier this year, with difficulty).  For example, Moderna
recently issued a press release <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup> on their strategy for
variants in general and Omicron in particular:  
1. They've tested higher doses of the original vaccine (100&mu;g) in a booster.  Tests are
   underway to see if sera from high booster recipients are active against Omicron.  
2. They have 2 multi-valent booster candidates already in clinical trials:  
   - mRNA-1273.211 was originally started for the Beta variant, but Beta has many
     mutations in common with Omicron.  
   - mRNA-1273.213 was originally designed against both Beta and Delta, but also has a
     number of mutations covered that occur in Omicron.  
   - Sera from subjects in those trials will be tested against Omicron samples when
     available.  
3. They're working furiously on an Omicron-specific booster, mRNA-1273.529.  They seem to
   be able to go from initial knowledge of the sequence to clinical testing in 60-90
   days.  (I cannot emphasize enough: _this is a stupendous improvement._  Previous
   vaccines would take years to get to clinical trials.)  

So there _are_ sensible defenses being prepared.  

Jetelina's closing words:

> system. We also have thousands of scientists around the world working on our questions
