There's a new SARS-CoV2 variant.  How bad does it look?  Nobody _really_ knows, but it's
got the potential to be very, very bad.  


## So, nu?  

The next letter of the Greek alphabet available was &nu; (nu).  I had a whole raft of
jokes based on the
[Yiddish expresson "so, nu?"](https://forward.com/culture/12736/just-say-nu-01335/)
meaning something like "so, go on and tell me more?"  "So, nu?" is never going to be a
COVID-19 joke, more's the pity.  Sort of.  

The next letter after that in the Greek alphabet is &xi; (xi, or as we were taught in my
mis-spent youth, chsi).  Alas, there is a certain autocrat who might take unbrage at the
use of his family name for a virus originating in his country, especially when his
propaganda apparatus is pushing the story that SARS-CoV2 originated in America instead of
China.  No point in poking the dragon with a sharp stick, unless you have plans for what
to do after that.  

So&hellip; &omicron; (omicron) it is, then&hellip; according to the World Health
Organization's Technical Avisory Group (yes, it's really called the
"WHO TAG team"). <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  


## Our safari guide  

Having been deprived of our opportunity for humor, let's get down to business.  Our safari
guide in these matters is [your local epidemiologist](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com),
a.k.a. [Katelyn Jetelina](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/about). <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
She's a professor in the department of epidemiology at the University of Texas Health
Science Center at Houston, with a PhD in epidemiology &amp; biostatistics, and is an
editor of _BMJ_.  Ok, she's convinced me to listen.  (Feel free to make up your own jokes
about "epidemiologists going viral".  I'm still grumpy at being deprived of "so, nu?")

She posted yesterday about the Omicron variant. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  Let's go
through what she wrote, see what we can simplify, and examine her primary sources to see
if we can add anything of our own.  (Hint: Not much.  She's _good._  Really, really good.)  


## Where did this thing come from?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-b-1-1-529-lineage.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-b-1-1-529-lineage-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="196" alt="PANGO/NextStrain generated cladogram of SARS-CoV2 lineages" title="PANGO/NextStrain generated cladogram of SARS-CoV2 lineages" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

It's been given the name B.1.1.529, meaning it's a descendant of one of the very early
B.1.1 variants.  It is, in particular, _not_ a descendant of the more recent Delta
variant.  The only public cladogram I can find is the blurry one shown here (click to
embiggen). <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>   (The
[relevant PANGO/NextStrain servers](https://nextstrain.org/fetch/genome.ucsc.edu/trash/ct/subtreeAuspice1_genome_17ae0_cf96f0.json)
are not responding to me when I try to generate my own, probably because _every scientist
on the planet_ is asking them questions right now!)  

So let me attempt to guide us through this a bit:  
- Everything starts with the original Wuhan virus.  
- The horizontal axis is the number of mutations, increasing to the right.  
- When a new strain occurs, the mutations are compared to the existing strains to tell us
  where to put it into the tree, i.e., the parental strains from which it evolved.  This
  is all rule-based, i.e., nobody's making decisions here that might be biased.  
- The assigned name is generated by walking the tree, e.g., our boy today being called
  B.1.1.529 means it's one of many variants of B.1.1, which was a very early variant near
  the root of the tree.  
- The red line is 3 samples of the the Omicron variant.  __NB:__ Pay careful attention to
  how high up the tree it branches off!  It does _not_ branch of Delta, which would be
  somewhere up at the top of the plot.  Instead, it's a whole pile of mutations on top of
  one of the ancestral B.1.1 strains.  
  
It looks like somebody caught an older version of COVID-19 (which is less likely with
Delta in the wind, but still possible).  If this person were immunocompromised, then they
wouldn't be able to clear the virus for a long time.  So the virus just hung around in
their body, mutating, and mutating, and mutating&hellip;  

Et voila: Omicron!  It just has a boatload of mutations, making it quite different from
the other strains.  What will turn out to be important is _where_ those mutations occur,
and what they _do_.  


## But is it a _threat?_  

According to the WHO TAG team, possibly.  They've designated it a "variant of concern"
(VOC), which is what we named things like Delta.  The crucial questions are, in a world
where Delta is now almost the only SARS-CoV2 strain worth worrying about:  

1. Does it transmit more than Delta?  (If not, Delta will out-compete it; if so, it will
   out-compete Delta.)  
2. Does it cause more severe disease than Delta?  (If not, then at least it's less bad
   than Delta and may give partial immunity to Delta; if so, then we want to avoid it at
   all costs.)  
3. Does it evade current vaccines?  (If not, just push harder on getting people vaccinated
   _and boosted;_ if so, then we need a vaccine specific to Omicron &amp; possibly Delta
   also as soon as possible and _then get everybody re-vaccinated!_  Imagine how much fun
   that will be&hellip;)  
   
What's the evidence that any of those are issues?  Consider where the mutations in the
spike protein lie.  Here our primary informant is [Jeffrey Barrett](https://twitter.com/jcbarret),
CSO of Nightingale Health and leading the COVID-19 genomics issue at the Sanger
Institute.  He's classified them (click to view the entire table in the tweet, not the
cut off version here):  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

His explanations of the details of that table in following tweets are quite worth
reading, explaining in detail why each color is bad news.  But for now, let's go with
Jetelina's summary:  
- Red: Known bad. These are mutations seen in previous VOC's that have made the virus more
  deadly.  Just what we need, eh?  
- Purple: New mutations not seen in the wild, but _in vitro_ data suggest they might be
  bad.  
- Yellow: They're near an important site on the protein, but nobody knows what they do.  
- Blue: Never seen before, no lab data, nobody knows.  
- Green: Mutation seen lots of times before, basically fixed in the genome all the way
  back to 2020.  Nothing to worry about.  
  
Note there is _not much green in the list!_  Some of them are in important places where
vaccine-induced antibodies bind, and thus could muck up vaccine immunity.  Others are in
places like the receptor binding domain (RBD) that could make it stick better to the human
ACE2 receptor, and thus become more virulent.  Yes, those statements involve the modal
word "may", but they still make everybody queasy at the number of gambles being taken.

Jetelina quotes this slide from a video presentation by the South Africa Health Ministry.
(This is extremely early data; we don't have the actual slides, and are reduced to
YouTube screen scrapes!  Click to embiggen.)  They show where the mutations lie along the
sequence of the spike protein, and color the regions by the function of that particular
domain: NTD, RBD, S1/S2 furin cleavage site, a deletion characteristic of evading the
innate immune system, and some other junk associated in other variants with increased
infectivity.  

_All that together, in one viral package._  I do not like this.  At _all._  

Sure, we're gonna have to spend serious time and effort understandint what all those
gizmos do&hellip; but what are the chances they're mostly benign?  Not much, I think.  


## Some empirical data  

Ok, enough noodling around with genomic information that _might_ be bad.  Let's look at
what it's actually been _seen_ to do in South Africa.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-yle-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-27-so-nu-yle-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="YLE: Increase in positive test rates in Gauten, South Africa, over 2 weeks" title="YLE: Increase in positive test rates in Gauten, South Africa, over 2 weeks" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Jetelina points us at this slide from the South African National Institute for
Communicable Diseases (NICD).  Note that in the Gauteng region (top right), positive test
rates went from 1% to 30%, _in two weeks!_  That's&hellip; _terrifyingly fast._  

So that's one bit of evidence in favor of increased infectiousness for Omicron.  

Now, to be sure, it's likely the population there is largely unvaccinated.  This is the
cost of vaccine inequity: we leave the developing world defenseless, and in the process of
being victims of SARS-CoV2 they become breeding grounds for variants that can come back
and kill the rest of humanity.  If it's not enough to make the moral argument that we
should all be each other's keepers, then pay attention to the selfish argument that you
don't want variants breeding and coming back to kill you.

The estimates from modeler [JPWeiland](https://twitter.com/JPWeiland) say that while Delta
is 70% more transmissible than SARS-CoV2 classic, Omicron appears to be 700% more
transmissible.  When you compare that with the share of sequenced cases in South Africa,
that number is about right.  Jetelina shows us this (approximated) graph from 
[John Burn-Murdoch](https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch), chief data reporter at the very
pink _Financial Times_ (click to embiggen). Whatever's going on, Omicron is spreading
_more rapidly than Delta_, at least in a largely unvaccinated population.  

I haven't tried to fit a logistic curve like these guys have, because the data isn't out
yet.  But if they're even _mostly_ right, Omicron is spreading fast.  

__Conclusion:__ Omicron is very likely to be _more infectious than Delta._  


## Some good(?) news  

Jetelina points out 3 potentially good signs:  

1. Omicron can be distinguished from other variants by a PCR test, instead of requiring a
   sequencing machine.  
2. We've seen it very, very early and have a little bit of time to figure out what to do.
   The South Africans have been completely amazing and deserve our respect and gratitude.  
3. mRNA vaccines can be rapidly "reprogrammed" to make new proteins.  (Though
   manufacturing, distribution, and getting shots in arms are other matters, as we
   discovered to our sorrow this year.)  

   But people are estimating 6 weeks to do the mini-trial, then a week or so for the FDA
   &amp; CDC to approve/EUA it.  In an article today from NPR <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, 
   Moderna said it was working on booster vaccines anticipating mutations like Omicron,
   and is ramping up efforts on a Delta-specific and Omicron-specific vaccine; Pfizer and
   BioNTech said once they have enough information in the next 2 weeks, they could have
   Omicron boosters ready to ship in 100 days.  

So maybe we can fight it with vaccines.  If people will _take_ the vaccines!  

## The Weekend Conclusion  

1. It's _important_ to protect the immunocompromised members of our community!  It's not
   just the moral thing to do, but it also is good for _everyone_ to prevent the
   occurrence of sources of mutations.  
2. For the same reason, it's _important_ for everybody to get vaccinated!  In Jetelina's
   words:  
   > Get vaccinated. Get boosted. Ventilate spaces. Use masks. Test if you have
   > symptoms. Isolate if positive. And encourage others to do the same.  
3. The crucial questions are, as above: 
   1. Does it transmit more than Delta?  
   2. Does it cause more severe disease than Delta?  
   3. Does it evade current vaccines?  
   
We should fervently hope the answers to all 3 of those questions are "no".
