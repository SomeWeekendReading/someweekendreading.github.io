Today the US FDA's Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) met
to discuss the composition of COVID-19 booster vaccines for fall 2024.  Let's check out
the science content.  


## VRBPAC Meeting Announcement  

People act as if COVID-19 is "over".  The virus begs to differ.  We're looking at summer
and winter waves into the indefinite future.  People will die of COVID-19, or &ndash; like your
humble Weekend Editor &ndash; will have Long COVID brain fog and other problems.  

Fortunately, our regulatory bodies are not ignoring this and are on the case for updated
booster vaccines.  Getting the public, even the non-knucklehead public who are not
conspiracy theorists, to take the vaccines&hellip; well, that's another matter.  We can
solve the vaccine design problem; thus far we have not solved the public vaccine uptake
problem.  

Today we look at the latest meeting of the FDA VRBPAC, to consider the strain composition
of the vaccine for this fall.

We start, of course, with periodic monitoring of the FDA's advisory committee
calendar. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

There we see, postponed from 2024-May-16 to allow for more data collection, the VRBPAC meeting
today on vaccine strain composition. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> 

At the bottom of that page are links to all the presentation materials, as well as a
livestream on YouTube <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, for those of us who want to watch
and hear all the discussion.  


## The Usual Administrivia  

The usual boilerplate was boiled and plated thusly:  
- There were 24 members, including temporary members, of which it appears 17 were in
  attendance.  <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  (Though, as you'll see below, there were
  16 votes counted.)  
- Interestingly, there were no conflicts of interest reported for
  waivers! <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  

  That's a bit unusual, since almost always _somebody_ has some stock, or a consulting
  agreement, or some research funding from industry.  Not enough to be a red flag, but an
  interesting fact behind which there's probably a story.

The meeting agenda <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> contains the usual things:  
- Start with introductions and administrivia.  
- Most of the day will be scientific presentations.  
- Then there's an hour of public commentary (for which, by tradition, everybody pretty much goes
  away because it's usually too much to bear for mere mortals).  
- Finally the discussion and voting will be at about 2:30pm.  It's all about whether the
  current monovalent XBB.1.5 vaccination should be updated to the current strains (JN.1
  lineage: JN.1, KP.2, KP.3, LA.2, &hellip;).  
  
You'd think this should be pretty much a slam-dunk "yes" vote, but let's see what
_actually_ happens: they're allocating 2 hours for this discussion and voting.  


## The FDA Briefing Document  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-6.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-6-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="FDA Briefing Doc, Figure 1: Recent antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States" title="FDA Briefing Doc, Figure 1: Recent antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
There's always a formal briefing document <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> filed by the
FDA itself for a meeting like this.  It's&hellip; dense, as is the custom of the tribe.  

However, Figure 1 is outstanding.  It tells us the current set of strains active in the
US, and how they have changed over time.  
- It shows each variant of concern (VOC) with circulating above 1% over 2-week periods from
  February through May.  (It's slightly unclear just what population is being measured:
  hospitalized patients (if so, where?), wastewater (from where?), etc.  Probably digging
  into the CDC web site shown at the bottom of the figure would answer those questions.)  
- In February, the JN.1 variant had completely displaced the XBB.1.5 variant that was the
  big noise last fall.  
- However, by mid-May, JN.1 was itself crowded out by other variants.  We'll see later
  that these are in the same variant family as JN.1.  The virus is honing the
  infectiousness of JN.1 at quite a rapid rate, to have this fast turnover.  
  
This is graphic evidence that SARS-CoV2 is not done with humanity.  It doesn't help that
we've given up any protective measures, and decided upon helplessness and ignorance as a
strategy.  This will not end well.  

However, at least the the problem we _can_ solve, vaccine composition, the course is
clear.  Target the JN.1 lineage, whether via monovalent or multivalent formulation.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-7.jpg" width="400" height="200" alt="FDA framework for the meeting" title="FDA framework for the meeting" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
There was a (very) short presentation by Jerry Weir of the FDA <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>,
documenting the FDA vaccine process as a flowchart, and asking the discussion question and
voting questions above.  Seems pretty clear: the JN.1 lineage, broadly speaking, is the
current villain, and does everybody agree we should do something about that?  

__My prediction:__ everybody will agree on JN.1 family, but there will be argument over
monovalent vs multivalent formulations, and which age groups get it when.  


## Science Presentations  

### Ruth Link-Gelles, CDC: Effectiveness of Current Formulation  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8.jpg" width="400" height="210" alt="Link-Gelles: Effectiveness of current formulation" title="Link-Gelles: Effectiveness of current formulation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
First up was Ruth Link-Gelles of the CDC and a familiar face at FDA VRBPAC and CDC ACIP
meetings on COVID-19 vaccines.  She's reviewing the efficacy of last year's XBB.1.5
vaccine versus current strains.  <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> This is an achingly
significant topic!  

She's got a lot to say, but the high points for me were on 5 of her slides:  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8a.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8a-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="331" alt="Link-Gelles: uptake of booster stratifies STRONGLY by age" title="Link-Gelles: uptake of booster stratifies STRONGLY by age" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- First, booster uptake vs time and stratified by age was pretty miserable!  
  - Elders were most eager to get boosted, but among them only about 40% managed to do it.
  - After that, the plateau after about 5 months of availability stratifies by age, with
    younger cohorts doing demonstrably worse.  In fact, only about 10% of people in their
    20's managed to get boosted: they're walking Petri dishes, passing the virus around,
    giving it human lab space to try out mutations.  
  - This is one reason why COVID-19 _won't go away._  Really, to me the question is: are
    we making it that _difficult_ to get vaccinated, or do we keep it secret so nobody
    knows they need it, or are we just _stupid_?  (At least we can do something about the
    first 2 possibilities. For the 3rd possibility, we can only resort to Schiller:
    ["Mit der Dummheit kämpfen Götter selbst vergebens"]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#:~:text=Mit%20der%20Dummheit%20k%C3%A4mpfen%20G%C3%B6tter%20selbst%20vergebens).  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8b.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8b-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="208" alt="Link-Gelles: context is ADDITIONAL protection beyond infection-acquired" title="Link-Gelles: context is ADDITIONAL protection beyond infection-acquired" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Next, she goes on to point out that vaccine efficacy in this context means incremental immunity
    _over and above_ the already-existing immunity from previous vaccination or
    infection.  This makes a bit of a difference, especially among the young: they've been
    reckless about vaccination &amp; prevention, so they've been infected a lot, but that
    means they have some more immunity.  Boosters are especially important the older you
    are.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8c.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8c-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="Link-Gelles, ICATT: VE of 2023-2024 vs symptomatic infection, by age" title="Link-Gelles, ICATT: VE of 2023-2024 vs symptomatic infection, by age" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Then she looks at the ICATT data, to see the protection vs symptomatic infection, by age
  cohort and time since boost.  We see that it's about 50% (incrementally above
  pre-existing immunity), though it declines faster in elders.  After 6 months in those
  over 50, the error bar overlaps 0, which is why we _really_ want to see twice-yearly
  boosters for those over 50.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8d.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8d-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Link-Gelles, S-gene target failures showing difference with new strains" title="Link-Gelles, S-gene target failures showing difference with new strains" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- But of course the virus is a genetic moving target!  The sequencing methods using
  primers from the older variants _fail_ to detect part of the spike gene in the newer
  variants.  The plot here shows the rate of S-gene target failure, over time.  This
  exactly correlates with and explains the rise of the Omicron-descended variants JN.1,
  BA.2.86, and others.  They are _different._  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8e.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-8e-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="Link-Gelles: efficacy vs symptomatic infection, by S-gene target failure" title="Link-Gelles: efficacy vs symptomatic infection, by S-gene target failure" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Ok, they're different, but do they require a different vaccine?  The last plot shows the
  vaccine efficacy vs non-JN.1 and JN.1 variants.  The change to JN.1 causes a loss of 20%
  of efficacy; among those older than 50 this is enough to wipe out the immunity grant.
  So, conclusion: yes, we need an updated vaccine!  


### Natalie Thornburg, CDC: Current epidemiology &amp; genomics  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="Thornburg, CDC: Current epidemiology and genomics of SARS-CoV2" title="Thornburg, CDC: Current epidemiology and genomics of SARS-CoV2" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next up was Natalie Thornburg, also of the CDC, on the current epidemiology and genomics
of SARS-CoV2. <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>  

Basically: where is it, and what variants are out there with which we have to deal?  It's
always better to know your opponent's presence and capabilities, so your defense and
counterattack can be more effective!  

There were 7 slide in her presentation that stood out to me, documenting the continuing
rates of infection, and the importance of the JN.1 lineage:  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9a.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9a-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="Thornburg, CDC: weekly trends in death and seropositivity rates" title="Thornburg, CDC: weekly trends in death and seropositivity rates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- We have 4 years of COVID-19 history.  Thornburg first examines this, looking at about
  4.4 years of weekly death rates and weekly test positivity rates.  (Though I don't know
  exactly where the test positivity rates come from, given that people almost _never_
  report home test results.  There's something called the National Respiratory and Enteric
  Virus Surveillance System, about which I know nothing but which looks interesting.)  The
  lesson is clear:  
  - Before about 2022-Apr, death rates and positivity rates were highly correlated.
    People got COVID-19 with some probability, and they died with some additional
    probability.  
  - But after 2022-Apr, they decoupled somewhat to the extent that while they are still
    clearly related, the death rates went down by a factor of 2 or 3.  This is because of
    population-wide immunity: people either got vaccinated (the smart way) or they rolled
    the dice and happened to survive COVID-19 (the stupid way).  Either way, there was
    more immunity and less death.  

  _This is a vaccine success story._  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9b.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9b-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="Thornburg, CDC: Seroprevalence of various kinds of immunity in US blood donors over time" title="Thornburg, CDC: Seroprevalence of various kinds of immunity in US blood donors over time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Next we look at the seroprevalence of various immunity markers in the US population,
  over time.  
  - Some immunity comes from vaccination, some from infection, and some from both.  
  - This graph tells us 2 things: 
    - At this point, 90% or more of the population has some kind of exposure like this.  
    - The vaccine-only group is shrinking, as they gradually get infected.  However,
      because they're vaccinated, it's usually a low-consequence infection.  There are
      "breakthrough" infections, but vaccines still keep you out of the hospital.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9c.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9c-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="221" alt="Thornburg, CDC: Winter 2023-2024 rise of the JN.1 lineage" title="Thornburg, CDC: Winter 2023-2024 rise of the JN.1 lineage" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- The lineages active winter 2023-2024 are a rather sad tale.  In summer 2023, the FDA
  approved a monovalent vaccine based on XBB.1.5.  This is what subsequently happened:
  - XBB.1.5 quickly died out, being replaced by mostly JN.1.  JN.1 is _not_ a descendant of
    XBB.1.5, but rather a _de novo_ strain from much higher up in the phylogentic tree of
    SARS-CoV2 strains.  Thus, cross-immunity from an XBB.1.5 vaccine was limited.  
  - It's a story of being behind the virus, always deciding on a strain and then letting
    the virus mutate away from it.  We have to move faster, and make more sure of the
    relevance of our vaccinations.  
  - Right now, the big bears in the woods are JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3 (_q.v._).  Fortunately, they're
    all closely related (_q.v._), so a vaccine against JN.1 will work against the
    others.  But who knows what will happen this winter?!  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9d.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9d-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="Thornburg, CDC: Weighted & nowcast showing JN.1 becoming KP.2 and KP.3" title="Thornburg, CDC: Weighted & nowcast showing JN.1 becoming KP.2 and KP.3" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- The 'nowcast' confirms this.  Since February, JN.1 has been dominant.  But now t is
  being supplanted, by KP.2, KP.3, and JN.1.7.  Have a look at the variant names in the
  table on the right: every name there with prevalence &gt; 1% is in the JN.1 family, as
  you'll see on the lineage diagram that comes next.  Clear Lesson: JN.1 and its
  descendants are dominant now.  There's nothing on the horizon _now_ that looks more
  important, though it's impossible to know what will happen by winter.  Still, if you
  have to bet &ndash; and, alas, you do &ndash; then betting your vaccine strain on the
  JN.1 family is the best bet known for now.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9e.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9e-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="219" alt="Thornburg, CDC: Relationship of recent SARS-CoV2 lineages" title="Thornburg, CDC: Relationship of recent SARS-CoV2 lineages" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- How are all these variants related?  We have a statistical technique that can take the
  genetic sequence and arrange it into a _phylogenetic tree_, as shown here, based on the
  similarities and the mutations.  It's not perfect &ndash; people argue _all the time_
  about the relevance of "lumpers" and "splitters" &ndash; but it's good enough for what
  we want to know.  
  - The XBB lineage, toward the bottom, is what last winter's booster targeted.  
  - The JN lineage, toward the top, is what's happening now.  They are very different!  
  - However, KP.2 and KP.3 are direct descendants of JN.1, so we should expect a JN.1
    vaccine to work well for them too, if they supplant JN.1.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9f.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9f-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Thornburg, CDC: Mouse sera antigenic distances between JN.1, KP.2, KP.3" title="Thornburg, CDC: Mouse sera antigenic distances between JN.1, KP.2, KP.3" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- If we move beyond sequence similarity/difference and look at how an actual immune system
  responds, then we have this slide on "antigentic distance" (in mice).  Now, there's a
  lot going on here: multidimensional immune readouts represented in 2 dimensions with a
  variety of techniques (multidimensional scaling, principal components, singular value
  decompositions, tSNE clusters, &hellip;).  But suffice to say that "close in this plane"
  means "close in terms of how mouse immune systems respond".  
  - The point: JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3 are all close in terms of immune response.  
  - Therefore, the _biologically_ murine immune response confirms the _sequence_ based
    phylogenetic tree above.  So there's hope a JN.1 vaccine would work nicely for KN.2 and
    KN.3.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9g.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-9g-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="218" alt="Thornburg, CDC: Clinical odds ratios with XBB and JN lineages" title="Thornburg, CDC: Clinical odds ratios with XBB and JN lineages" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Finally, we have to ask if this is really worth it.  If JN.1, KN.2, and KN.3 were
  remarkably _milder_ than the previous strains, we might not bother.  That's the point
  here, looking at odds ratios for the need of various hospital interventions like oxygen,
  between XBB infections and JN infections.  Note that all the odds ratios are _not_
  statistically significantly different from 1, i.e., the severity is about the same.  So:
  yes, this is worth it.  

### David Wentworth, WHO: Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-10.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="Wentworth, WHO: TAG-CO-VAC statement on COVID-19 vaccine composition" title="Wentworth, WHO: TAG-CO-VAC statement on COVID-19 vaccine composition" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
David Wentworth of the World Health Organization spoke next.  He's part of something
called the Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition, or TAG-CO-VAC.  Silly
abbreviations aside, this seems exactly on-point for the meeting and was a perspective on
the world outside the US that we too frequently ignore.  <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>  

Alas, your humble Weekend Editor didn't get a great deal out of this talk, beyond the fact
that they recommended a monovalent JN.1 composition for the next vaccine, which is pretty
much where everybody else went anyway.  They looked at a fair amount of data, some even
unpublished, on genetics, antigenic characterization, immunogenicity of neutralizing
antibodies, vaccine efficacy of current vaccines against XBB and JN lineages, and so on.
So it's not an idle recommendation, I just couldn't follow it all that well.

He did present important information showing that nearly all the viral sequences observed
in infected patients (selected how?) across the world are either JN.1 or within the JN.1
clade.  

The rest was data similar to that presented above, all of which indicated that XBB.1.5
immunization had some cross-immunity with JN.1, but was not ideal.  

So basically all the evidence so far points to JN.1 as the root of the clade for which we
want a vaccine.  I'd think a multivalent vaccine with JN.1, KP.2, and KP.3 would be ideal,
but it appears people preferred just JN.1.  

### Frances Priddy &amp; Darin Edwards, Moderna: Vaccines Update  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-11.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Priddy & Edwards, Moderna: Vaccines update" title="Priddy & Edwards, Moderna: Vaccines update" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next was the Moderna presentation. <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  It seems they've
developed at-risk vaccines based on both JN.1 and KP.2, which is in the JN.1 lineage but
seems to be overtaking JN.1 now.  We can only applaud this effort to get ahead of the
situation and vaccinate against the VoC that's _growing._  

There was a  nice review of the safety of the current XBB.1.5 vaccine (summary: very
safe), and cross-neutralization against the new strains (summary: ok, not great).  

Then they confirmed what everybody else said, namely that JN.1 is the Big Bad for today,
and its lineage (KP.2, KP.3) will probably be the Big Bad for this coming winter.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-11a.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-11a-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="Priddy & Edwards, Moderna: Antigenic similarity in the JN lineage" title="Priddy & Edwards, Moderna: Antigenic similarity in the JN lineage" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
I'll skip over their murine neutralizing antibody experiments (summary: better antibody
response with new vaccine vs new virus), and simply note that the JN.1 lineage variants
are more similar than we sometimes think.  This slide shows Venn diagrams of the
overlapping mutations.  Note the very, very small counts unique to each strain (0, 1, 3); these are
_really_ small variations on a theme.  

The conclusion from this sequence data is that a JN.1 vaccine should be effective vs KP.2
and KP.3.  The immunologic data above confirmed this _in vivo_ in mice, so it's pretty
believable at this point.  

They're prepared to make either a JN.1 or a KP.2 vaccine, whichever gets licensed, for the
market starting 2024-Aug.  That's&hellip; _very_ good news.  

### Kayvon Modjarrad, Pfizer/BioNTech: Preclinical & Clinical Supportive Data  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-12.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="Modjarrad, Pfizer: Vaccine formula supportive data" title="Modjarrad, Pfizer: Vaccine formula supportive data" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next was the Pfizer/BioNTech presentation. <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>  Like
everybody else, Modjarrad wanted to talk about (a) epidemiology, (2) performance of the
existing XBB.1.5 vaccine, and (iii) preclinical data on their JN.1 vaccine.  

There's lots of murine data, but the summary is about what you'd expect: the XBB vaccine
works well against XBB.1.5 and less well vs JN lineage; the JN.1 and KP.2 vaccine works
better against the JN lineage.  

Like Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech is prepared to supply either JN.1 or KP.2 vaccines upon
approval.  Again, good news.  

### Robert Walker, Novavax: Data in Support of Vaccine Update  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-13.jpg" width="400" height="229" alt="Walker, Novavax: Vaccine update support data" title="Walker, Novavax: Vaccine update support data" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The final commercial presentation was from Novavax. <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup>
In a way, we kinda have to admire them, for still being in the game with a protein vaccine
despite the general superiority of the mRNA vaccines.  

But we also have to ask _why_ they're still doing this.  Apparently the point of having a
protein vaccine, comparable or slightly less effective than mRNA, is to appeal to people
who fear the mRNA vaccines.  Given the data, that fear must be regarded as superstitious
at this point.  But it's a real fear, and if the only way we can vaccinate them is this
way, then&hellip; I guess we do it this way.  

They report the same stuff: epidemiology, XBB vaccine performance, and preclinical data on
a JN.1 vaccine.  Most of that says the same thing as everybody else, so we'll concentrate
on their novel contributions with their vaccine.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-13a.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-13a-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Walker, Novavax: Protein vaccine design" title="Walker, Novavax: Protein vaccine design" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Their vaccine is a protein-based vaccine.  They've taken an insect protein (_S
frugiperda_, the fall armyworm moth) and decorated it with multiple copies of the
SARS-CoV2 spike protein.  There's also what's called an _adjuvant_, which is basically
something designed to drive your immune system nuts so it reacts more strongly.  
  
I gotta say, if people are scared of mRNA, I don't get why they're _not_ scared of a
fall armyworm protein decorated with viral proteins.  Clearly the anti-vax propaganda is
very specific in its effect on them!  

The vaccine shows antibody responses about where you might expect.  I didn't see a
head-to-head comparison with either mRNA vaccine, probably because they're not available
to Novavax to use in their labs.  

Novavax is prepared to manufacture a JN.1 vaccine for shipment to US warehouses in
2024-Aug, though no word about international availability.  The slower speed and
difficulty of retargeting the protein vaccine platforms means they probably can't supply
internationally, and can't cope with a target change away from JN.1 if the VRBPAC were to
mandate that.  

Fortunately for Novavax, it looks at this point as though the stars are aligning toward
JN.1.  


### Jerry Weir, FDA: FDA Recommendations on Vaccine Composition  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-14.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="Weir, FDA: Recommendations for vaccine formula" title="Weir, FDA: Recommendations for vaccine formula" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The final presentation was from the FDA itself. <sup id="fn15a">[[15]](#fn15)</sup>  

They start out explaining how we got here in previous VRBPAC meetings.  This is important,
because it illustrates the _need_ to get out ahead of the viral variants.  Being too
conservative means giving a vaccine in the fall that is marginal instead of extremely
good.  Particularly for elders, this is life and death, and now the whole VRBPAC
understands that.  (I hope.)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-14a.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-06-05-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-fall-2024-FDA-14a-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="***" title="***" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
</a>
Epidemiologically, they show the same information as everybody else: the JN lineage is
pretty distant from the XBB lineage, and it's more or less completely dominant now in the
US and in much of the world.  KP.2 and KP.3 are catching up, but as we saw in the Venn
diagrams above, these are minor elaborations on the theme of JN.  I particularly liked the
way they elaborated the phylogenetic tree of lineages, showing the XBB and JN lineages in
separate dashed boxes: it's illustration rather than statistics, but it makes the point.  

They confirm what everybody else says: JN.1/KP.2/KP.3 are dominant, XBB vaccines are only
sorta ok-ish against them, and JN.1 vaccines will be better.  


## Discussion &amp; Voting  

### Discussion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hmpf.png" width="400" height="160" alt="Hmpf." title="Hmpf." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Interestingly, the chair Arnold Monto, was asked about multivalent formulations, and said
"I'm gonna rule that out of order", because the voting question was already fixed.  Seems
unfortunate, since multivalent mRNA vaccines are not much harder than monovalent.  Really
all we have to show is that they don't cause stronger immune reactions?  Hmpf.

This is a 2-stage decision: first decide the lineage (JN.1 or not) and then the specific
viruses.  Who decides the specific virus, since the manufacturers differ right now in
their prior choices?  Does the CDC do that?  

Looks like it was indeed a slam-dunk in favor of JN.1 lineage, as I predicted.  (Chair
Monto: "The committee is unusually silent and in agreement.")  

### Voting  

There are 8 voting members + 8 temporary voting members, for 16 in total.  Polled the
committee, everybody gets 1 minute to pontificate, an opportunity to change minds at the
end, and then after that votes are locked in.  

Oddly, they went silent on Zoom and escorted all non-voting members out of the room during
voting.  I _completely_ fail to see what a secret ballot adds here, unless somebody was
afraid of being intimidated in public?  Weird.  

__Results:__  Called by name (_defeating_ vote secrecy?!) 16 yes to 0 no to 0 abstain.  


### More Discussion  

Arnold Monto suggests they discuss here which strain of the JN.1 variants should go into
the monovalent vaccine:  
- Whatever we recommend today probably won't be the one circulating in winter, but the
  cross-protection is strong.  So JN.1 is a strong candidate on the basis that it's "the
  trunk of the tree" and not some random branch.   *** SARS CoV2 lineage figure to show
  "trunk of the tree" meaning  
- Given Novavax, the only non-mRNA vaccine, is JN.1 there will be problems if we switch
  because Novavax can't move fast.  That may cause equity problems for those reluctant to
  accept an mRNA vaccine.  
- Having both a protein-based and an mRNA-based vaccine at the same time is probably
  good.  But let's not get into this position in the future, where we're constrained by
  the slowest manufacturing type.  
- Don't know if most prevalent variants will mutate back toward JN.1, or away from it.
  And if away from it, we don't know what the cross-immunity will be.  Also, KP.2 and KP.3
  appear to be evolving in different directions away from JN.1, so it's not even just one
  choice.  
  - _Weekend Editorial:_  Seems to me that's a good argument for a multivalent formulation!  
  - A couple others agree, e.g., JN.1 and KP.2 or KP.3.  But we can't do that, because it
    will make Novavax different and introduce complexity in getting physician and patient
    compliance.  
- Monto: previously when we did a multivalent formulation, we had very different strains,
  but here they're pretty similar.  
- The main adverse events are anaphylaxis and myocarditis, but those are so rare you
  really need large studies to see them with any statistical significance.  
  - _Weekend Editorial:_  Because the effect size is so small!  
p- KP.2 is probably too specific, and JN.1 is a safer bet?  
- Pragmatism: "If we make a good recommendation that people are simply _not_ going to follow, that's
  harmful to vaccination in general."  

Adjourned at 3:26PM EDT, endorsing a monovalent JN.1 formulation for 2024-2025.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

They got 1 "hmpf" + 1 "weird" from me today.  A couple of other oddities:  
- JN.1 pronounced as "Jane-1", like "your evil sister Jane"  
- "FLiRT mutations" is of course always fun:  
  - These variants, JN.1 and descendants, have mutations F456L, V1104L and R346T.  
    - F456L means at position 456 on the spike protein, an amino acid phenylalanine (F)
      was changed to leucine (L).  
    - V1104L, similarly changed at position 1104 a valine (V) to leucine (L).  
    - R346T means at position 346, an arginine (R) was changed to a threonine (T).  
  - Somebody looked at F456L and R346T and decided the abbreviation "FLiRT" was a mnemonic
    (though it left out all the other mutations, e.g., V1104L and a host of others).

It looks like they converged on a monovalent JN.1 vaccine, rejecting multivalent
alternatives as out of scope and possibly because cross-immunity from JN.1 would be
sufficient.  

Clear enough.  Good enough.  

When it's available in the fall, the Weekend Editrix and I will fire up the Weekend
Zeppelin for a trip to go get it.  Probably along with a flu vaccination.  Possibly with
an RSV vaccination, though I don't know if those are annual or not.
