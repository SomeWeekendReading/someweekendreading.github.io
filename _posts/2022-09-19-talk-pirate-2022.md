Today, September 19, is [International Talk Like a Pirate Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day).  


## Arrr&hellip; ahoy, maties!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day.png" width="200" height="200" alt="International Talk Like a Pirate Day" title="International Talk Like a Pirate Day" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Also, the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.  

[This cannot be a coincidence, because nothing is a coincidence](https://unsongbook.com/),
as Scott taught us all.  Will there be pirate talk at the funeral?  

Also also, the birthday of [Hermione Granger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger),
were she so unfortunate as to become a real person in times like these.  

Also also also, the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) should be renamed
to "Arrr" just for the day, if it were up to me.  (Of course it is not up to me.  We will
here pause briefly that you may offer thanks to the deity of your choice that I am in
charge of very little indeed.)  

Just think of the possibilities.  Just _think._
