Today, September 19, is [International Talk Like a Pirate Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day)!  


## Arrr&hellip; ahoy, maties!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day.png" width="200" height="200" alt="International Talk Like a Pirate Day" title="International Talk Like a Pirate Day" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Also, the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.  (Who will give the Pirate Oration at the funeral?)  

Also also, it would be the birthday of
[Hermione Granger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermione_Granger),
were she so unfortunate as to become a real person during times like these.  

Also also also, the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) should be renamed
to "Arrr" just for International Talk Like a Pirate Day, if it were up to me.  (Of course
it is not up to me.  We will here pause briefly that you may offer thanks to the deity of
your choice that very little indeed is up to me.)  

[This cannot be a coincidence, because nothing is a coincidence](https://unsongbook.com/),
as Scott taught us all:

> The timer read 4:33, which is the length of John Cage’s famous silent musical
> piece. 4:33 makes 273 seconds total. -273 is absolute zero in Celsius. John Cage’s piece
> is perfect silence; absolute zero is perfect stillness. In the year 273 AD, the two
> consuls of Rome were named Tacitus and Placidianus; “Tacitus” is Latin for “silence” and
> Placidianus is Latin for “stillness”. 273 is also the gematria of the Greek word eremon,
> which means “silent” or “still”. __None of this is a coincidence because nothing is ever a
> coincidence.__  

Just think of the possibilities.  Just _think._
