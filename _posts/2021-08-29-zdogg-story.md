I'm a data-driven guy who detests persuasian by emotional anecdotes.  But most people are,
to my dismay, different in that regard.  ZDoggMD does a good job today of persuading
them.  

## Data analysis vs emotional anecdotes  

I'm a really data-driven guy, who is largely persuaded by logical and mathematical
arguments.  (Ok, not _totally,_ but largely.)  I _detest_ media reporters who are obsessed
with emotional anecdotes and manipulative storytelling rather than giving me enough
information to know if something is newsworthy.  

Still&hellip; I have to admit that though I am what I am, the world nonetheless is what it
is, and neither of us is inclined to change to suit the other.  If you want to persuade
most people, you have to have an anecdote and tell it in the properly emotionally
manipulative manner.  This seems to me a bit of the Dark Arts; nonetheless, with care, it
can be done in the service of good.  


## ZDoggMD shows how it is done

That brings us to today's video by ZDoggMD <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, whom we've
mentioned before on this crummy little blog that nobody reads.  

Today he tells the story of one of his viewers who was a bit vaccine hesitant, ended up
getting COVID with post-infection mental debilitation, infecting his wife, infecting some
of his kids, and most heartbreakingly, his parents.  His father will likely die.  

The viewer, of course, feels an incredible burden of guilt.  In expiation, he has
personally persuaded 3 people to get vaccinated, which is a good first step of repentance
in my book.  

I sort of liked Zubin's conclusion:  
- First, deep sympathy.  It's important to listen to, and respect people's pain.  
- Second, asking him to forgive himself and explaining _why:_  
> &hellip; we all do the best we can with the information we have.  Please don't beat
> yourself up.  Seriously, forgive yourself.  We do the best we can, in the face of
> conflicting information, misinformation, disinformation, poor communication from
> authorities that are supposed to be looking out for us, who somehow can't understand
> that shaming people into submission on vaccines is not gonna work.  
> &hellip;  
> Now, the truth is, &lt;_name_&gt; should forgive himself because it could have been that
> they were all vaccinated weeks or months in advance and still got infected.  It could
> have been that his parents were in the small group of individuals that _still_ got very
> sick, despite vaccine.  It could be that he and his family still got infected with
> Delta, even though they were vaccinated.  __But the truth is, the statistics say that
> all those things were much, much less likely had they gotten vaccinated.__
>  
> And that's what I want to stick with you, that if we're talking about risk, if we're
> talking about our loved ones, if we're talking about not just ourselves, but those
> around us: getting vaccinated is still the lowest risk for the highest reward because
> natural COVID infection for many people is just not safe.  
>  
> And so we're doing the best we can.  
> &hellip;  
> And &lt;_name_&gt;, this is me, I'm looking right at you.  Really, you did the best you
> could.  

(Boldface emphasis added, because it introduces statistics as a way of seeing past the
anecdote to the general case.)  

I'm significantly less tolerant of vaccine resistance than he is, and more prone to
things like mandates.  Maybe Zubin's just a nicer man than me.  He's using that to
persuade people to Do The Right Thing in ways that I cannot.  

Good for him.
