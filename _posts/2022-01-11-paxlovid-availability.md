Paxlovid is a remarkable early therapeutic for people who've caught COVID-19.  But&hellip;
it's very scarce for the next few months, ironically during the Omicron wave.  Where can
you score some paxlovid?!  


## More supply chain frustration?!  

Remember last spring when vaccines were being rolled out?  The glacial speed, bungled
supply chains, and general chaos?  (Not to mention the Republican disinformation
campaigns!)  

Welcome to the second act: the rollout of antiviral therapies like paxlovid and
molnupiravir&hellip; with glacial speed, bungled supply chains, and general chaos.
(Though so far, the conservative disinformation campaign seems to consist largely of
people claiming that paxlovid and molnupiravir are just ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine
repackaged at a higher price.  The people saying that seem to be utterly fact-proof.)

Part of the problem is the supply right now is approximately 0, and it's hard to
manufacture.  Derek Lowe, the awesome med-chem blogger at _In the Pipeline_, offered an
especially well-informed opinion a few days ago on where the bottlenecks
are. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

1. _Quantity:_  The dose is two 150mg tablets of nirmatrelvir twice a day for 5 days, and
   100mg of ritonavir twice a day for 5 days.  That adds up to great, whacking gram-level
   quantities of these very complex molecules:  
   - 150mg nirmatrelvir/pill $\times$ 2 pills/dose $\times$ 2 doses/day $\times$ 5 days =
     3 _grams_ of nirmatrelvir per course of treatment!  
   - 100mg ritonavir/pill $\times$ 1 pill/dose $\times$ 2 doses/day $\times$ 5 days =
     1 _gram_ of ritonavir per course of treatment!  
   So if you want 10 million courses of treatment, you need 30 megagrams = 30,000 kg = 30
   metric tons of nirmatrelvir and 20 metric tons of ritonavir.  This is&hellip;
   _daunting._  All that has to be made, then formulated (formed into tablets with
   appropriate bulk materials), packaged, shipped, delivered to pharmacies/hospitals/clincs&hellip;
   and it all has to be done as soon as possible.  
2. _Synthesis:_  Metric-ton level synthesis does not happen in funky little laboratories
   with peculiar bits of glassware all over.  It takes a big, noisy, smelly chemical
   plant.  Some of them are special-purpose, making only 1 precursor.  
3. _Chemical supply chain for reagents:_  There are a lot of inputs, so you won't make
   them all yourself.  You'll buy them.  Or, at least attempt to buy them.  The resulting
   chemical supply chain involves dozens of factories all over the world.  
4. _Foreign suppliers:_ Inevitably, most of the inputs to the process are from overseas,
   mostly Chinese because apparently that made sense to some MBAs at some point.  (__NB:__
   Like many scientists, I use "MBA" in its rather more pejorative sense.)  The US does
   not have that kind of capacity any more because of outsourcing, and we can't build it
   in less than probably a decade.

   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-11-paxlovid-availability-synthesis.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-11-paxlovid-availability-synthesis-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="264" alt="Owen, et al. @ Science: paxlovid synthesis of a few hundred grams for clinical trial" title="Owen, et al. @ Science: paxlovid synthesis of a few hundred grams for clinical trial" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   Last year, the paxlovid team published their data, including the synthesis (see
   Supplementary Info, package 1, at the end of the article for synthesis of all 6 candidate
   molecules). <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  The synthesis shown here (click to embiggen)
   is what they had to go through in order to make a measly few hundred grams of
   nirmatrelvir for the clinical trial (the ritonavir they could just buy, since it's
   already approved for HIV).  Lowe walks us through the whole thing, explaining what the
   various steps do (at least, if you're a synthetic organic chemist, so you can
   understand the explanation).  
   
   Many of the reagents are common, but some are decidedly _not:_ Lowe points out that the
   Boc-protected t-butylglycine used in T14 is something you can order in gram quantities,
   but very few suppliers would even attempt to deliver in ton quantities.  As always, it
   turns out that all those putative independent vendors are ordering from 1 guy in
   China.  So&hellip; there's a single point of failure, even if the vendors work hard to
   conceal it.  
   
   Very weirdly, some of the reagents depend for their synthesis on quantities of sodium
   metal.  There's not enough sodium metal around right now beause the brute-force
   synthesis requires lots of electricity, which is also in somewhat shorter supply.
   (Though, if we could shut down the stupid crypto miners, that would be fixable.  Do you
   think people would pause their speculative nonsense in favor of provably life-saving
   medicine?  I don't either, but then I'm a grumpy old man.)  
   
Lowe's summary of the chemical synthesis problems for paxlovid:  

> That's how it goes in the fine chemical business - there's a compound that no one really
> cares much about, until they do and they care hugely, and then suddenly no one cares
> about it again, until some other bizarre reason emerges to put it back into
> demand. Multiply that by the thousands of things that are or have been commercially

> &hellip;  
> What it all means is that when someone says "Oh, we can just make Paxlovid in plants all
> over the world", they have left out the rest of the sentence, which is ". . .if we can
> get the starting materials". And for now, supply of those starting materials is going to
> be tight.  

So it's not as simple as just letting other people (try to) build paxlovid plants!  


## Still&hellip; how can I get me some of that stuff?  

So that's one reason why paxlovid is hard to find.  It _will_ get better, though not on
the timescale by which Omicron gets worse.  What can you do in the meantime, if you need
paxlovid and want to know how to beat the crowd?  

I'm a little conflicted by this: shouldering your way to the front of the line might be
good for you, but it's bad for everybody who's pushed back.  That does real social damage
to us as a community.  So&hellip; conflict.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-11-paxlovid-availability-locator.jpg" width="400" height="114" alt="HealthData.gov: COVID-19 Public Therapeutic Locator" title="HealthData.gov: COVID-19 Public Therapeutic Locator" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
From NPR comes an article <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> which mostly points out the
obvious, that paxlovid is in short supply.  However, it does perform one very valuable
service: it points us to a US Department of Health &amp; Human Services web site for
finding various COVID-19 therapeutics, the
[COVID-19 Public Therapeutic Locator](https://healthdata.gov/Health/COVID-19-Public-Therapeutic-Locator/rxn6-qnx8/data).  <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

It can find [paxlovid]({{ site.baseurl }}/paxlovid-approved/),
[molnupiravir]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-molnupiravir/), and
[evusheld]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-evusheld/) for you.  (Did you forget evusheld?
Remarkably many people do.)   Of course, we're most interested in paxlovid.  It can also
do a number of visualizations like scatterplots and maps.  More interestingly to a
grizzled old stats nerd like your humble Weekend Editor, it also supports data downloads
for independent analysis.  

I think we need to say "well done" to the HHS on this one.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-11-paxlovid-availability-weekend-publisher-unconcerned.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-11-paxlovid-availability-weekend-publisher-unconcerned-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="The Weekend Publisher is unconcerned about your COVID-19 stuff." title="The Weekend Publisher is unconcerned about your COVID-19 stuff." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Ok, your humble Weekend Editor does not (yet) have COVID-19.  Nor do the Weekend Editrix
nor the Weekend Publisher.  But are we gonna try this thing out anyway?  (glares out the
screen at you)  

Of course we are.  

So I imagined the unwelcome scenario where I had to hunt down a way to fill a paxlovid
scrip for one of us here at Chez Weekend.  (Well, maybe not the cat. He, as you can see
here &ndash; click to embiggen &ndash; is unconcerned about your COVID-19 stuff.  It's a tomcat thing.)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-11-paxlovid-availability-locator-filter.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-11-paxlovid-availability-locator-filter-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="547" alt="HealthData.gov: filters based on US state, counties, paxlovid, and availability" title="HealthData.gov: filters based on US state, counties, paxlovid, and availability" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
So I put in the parameters for Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, hoping (without much hope) to find
paxlovid available somewhere within sailing distance in the Weekend Zeppelin.  The
associated filter is shown here (click to embiggen):  
- Set the state to Massachusetts.  
- Set the county to Middlesex, Suffolk, Norfolk, or Essex: the Boston-adjacent counties.  
- The medication ("Order Label") is paxlovid.  
- The courses available are &ge; 0, i.e., not sold out.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-11-paxlovid-availability-locator-result.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-11-paxlovid-availability-locator-result-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="61" alt="HealthData.gov: search results" title="HealthData.gov: search results" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The result is pretty interesting, shown here (click to embiggen).  There are exactly 3
vendors in the extended metro Boston area that have paxlovid in supply (18-20 courses of
treatment available).  That's 58 courses of treatment for about 4.87 million people
(0.000019 courses/person)!  

Yes, I think that officially qualifies as "hard to find".  

Interestingly, when I first ran this query a couple hours ago researching this article,
there were something like a dozen vendors (in just Middlesex and Suffolk counties).  So
over the course of a couple hours, most of the vendors sold out.  

So this is not a complete solution.  Empirically, we observe that paxlovid courses of
treatment sell out in a matter of minutes. And making it (marginally) easier to find
vendors still doesn't fix the supply problem, it just makes it easier for flash-mobs to
dogpile on the few places that have what little stock there is.  

Remind you of [seeking out vaccine apppointments in March of 2021]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot/)
yet?  

We got work to do.  


## Addendum 2022-Jan-12: Comparison to the Omicron tsunami  

I took a look at the IHME dataset for predictions of the Omicron tsunami (we can't really
call it just a _wave_ any more, right?).  The big question is: Will paxlovid become
available in time to save us from Omicron?  The big answer is: No.  

So check out [tomorrow's post]({{ site.baseurl }}/paxlovid-availability-vs-omicron-wave)
for that.
