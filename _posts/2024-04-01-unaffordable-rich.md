Can we afford to live in a world with billionaires?  It seems not!  


## What Are the Consequences of Tolerating the &Uuml;ber-Wealthy?

Yes, it's April Fool's Day.  

No, this is not a joke post.  

See&hellip; the world is in terrible condition.  We seem _determined_, world-wide, to
plunge into our most racist, xenophobic, fascist depths.  We are paralyzed by
disinformation perpetrated by governments.  We are crippled by billionaires accruing all
economic gains to themselves, and corporations evading monopoly law to gouge prices.  

It's not pretty.  I can't really muster the humor for it.  

So let's try to get a grip on the consequences of late-stage capitalism, in this case the
pernicious effects of severe economic inequality.  

The text for today's sermon is 2 commentaries and an editorial at the scientific journal
_Nature_.  

For those of you who are not scientists, or at least not so inclined, _Nature_ is an
absolute top-shelf journal.  This is where some of the finest papers get published.  The 3
items we're citing here are not scientific papers _per se_, but they are opinion
representing the absolute top of the field.  So when there's not just consensus, but 
_repeated consensus_, it's time to pay serious attention.  

### Why we can't afford the rich any more  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-nature-a.jpg" width="400" height="269" alt="Wilkinson &amp; Pickett @ Nature: Why the world cannot afford the rich" title="Wilkinson &amp; Pickett @ Nature: Why the world cannot afford the rich" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-nature-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="An encampment of homeless people next to a wealthy office district in Los Angeles" title="An encampment of homeless people next to a wealthy office district in Los Angeles" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Our first source <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> is from Wilkinson &amp; Pickett, authors
of the famous 2009 book [_Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spirit_Level_(book)) (recommended!).  

Their thesis: some degree of economic equality (or at least, less _inequality_ than we
have now) is essential for sustainability and for a civil society in which people
accommodate each other, rather than striving for fascism to favor their "side".  The picture
the editors chose to accompany their article, shown here, is bitterly ironic: a homeless
encampment in front of posh office buildings in Los Angeles.  

Why does _anyone_, with any sort of moral sensibility at all, tolerate this?  

It's not a recent phenomenon, since it goes back to the Reagan administration in the US,
when so many things began to fray apart (or were forced to fray by conservative policy).
But it has accelerated in the last few years: 

> Between 2020 and 2022, the world’s most affluent 1% of people captured nearly twice as
> much of the new global wealth created as did the other 99% of individuals put together,
> and in 2019 they emitted as much carbon dioxide as the poorest two-thirds of
> humanity. In the decade to 2022, the world’s billionaires more than doubled their
> wealth, to almost US$12 trillion.  

Does that matter?  After all, if a few people do spectacularly well, don't the rest of us
at least do reasonably well?  That's the usual argument offered from the right, though
nowadays they avoid the phrase "trickle-down economics".  The truth is rather brutal:  

> The evidence gathered by social epidemiologists, including us, shows that large
> differences in income are a powerful social stressor that is increasingly rendering
> societies dysfunctional. For example, bigger gaps between rich and poor are accompanied
> by higher rates of homicide and imprisonment. They also correspond to more infant
> mortality, obesity, drug abuse and COVID-19 deaths, as well as higher rates of teenage
> pregnancy and lower levels of child well-being, social mobility and public trust. The
> homicide rate in the United States — the most unequal Western democracy — is more than
> 11 times that in Norway (see go.nature.com/49fuujr). Imprisonment rates are ten times as
> high, and infant mortality and obesity rates twice as high.  
> &hellip;  
> Violence and bullying are also linked to competition for social status. Aggression is
> frequently triggered by disrespect, humiliation and loss of face. Bullying among
> schoolchildren is around six times as common in more-unequal countries. In the United
> States, homicide rates were five times as high in states with higher levels of
> inequality as in those with a more even distribution of wealth.  

So: is this a real, measurable effect in the world, or is it just complaining?  Evidence
points to the former: real, statistical measures show significance and strength to back
their conclusion.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-gini-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-gini-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="512" alt="Wikipedia: The Gini coefficient as a measure of economic inequality" title="Wikipedia: The Gini coefficient as a measure of economic inequality" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Economic inequality is usually measured by the
[Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient).  If you rank-order
people by their economic status (income, net worth, etc.), then you can assign to each
person a percentile rank in the population.  The Lorenz curve plots this: how many people
are there, up to a certain percentile rank?  See the curve shown here, from Wikipedia:  
- A straight line from 0% to 100% is perfect equality: everybody makes/possesses exactly
  the same amount of money.  (Not an economically desirable situation.)  
- A flat line from 0% to 100% with a spike at 100% is perfect _inequality:_ one person has
  all the wealth, and everybody else is just a slave.  (Also not a desirable situation,
  for many reasons beyond the economic.)

The Gini coefficient starts with the Lorenz, and computes a score which ranges from 0 to 1
for the entire population.  Considering the areas of the regions marked $A$ and $B$ in the
diagram, the Gini coefficient is:  

$$
G = \frac{A}{A + B}
$$

$G = 0$ is the (undesirable) situation for absolute equality of income/wealth.  $G = 1$ is
the (even more undesirable) situation for all wealth held by a single person.  In between
is where we get to argue about whether society is fair and healthy.  

So why all this mathematical muttering about inequality?  

First: c'mon, this is my blog; it's what we _do_ here! You should know by now that your
humble Weekend Editor's default position is that anything which _can_ be sensibly modeled
mathematically, _should_ be.  That's how we convince each other we're telling ourselves
the truth about the world, not just our preferences.  Poking holes in such models is how
we learn _what matters._  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-nature-2.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-nature-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="370" alt="Regression shows a relationship between income inequality and health/social/environmental problems" title="Regression shows a relationship between income inequality and health/social/environmental problems" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Second: it _matters._  Consider the plot shown here:  
- The horizontal axis is our new friend the Gini coefficient.  It shows countries of the
  world ranging from 0.25 (low inequality) to 0.45 (high inequality).  
- The vertical axis is a score assembled by Wilkinson &amp; Pickett in their social
  epidemiology research.  It combines an environmental score and a health &amp; social
  problems score.  
  
  The environmental component includes measures of 5 factors:  
  > five environmental areas: air pollution; recycling of waste materials; the carbon
  > emissions of the rich; progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development
  > Goals; and international cooperation (UN treaties ratified and avoidance of unilateral
  > coercive measures).  
  
  The health &amp; social problems score includes measures of 10 factors:  
  > infant mortality, life expectancy, mental illness, obesity, educational attainment,
  > teenage births, homicides, imprisonment, social mobility and trust.  

Now, I don't know the details of their environmental and social health score.  They also
don't report their data, so I can't reproduce their regression.  They don't even report
the slope coefficient and its 95% confidence limits, or even the $F$-test $p$-value of the
regression.  So about all we can do is admire the picture.  

But the picture is damning:  
- The US is in the upper right, with high inequality and a high degree of environmental
  and social problems.
- Look in the lower left, at all those well-developed European countries.  Very good on
  economic inequality control, and also very good in terms of social health and
  environment.  
- Also look at Japan: middling performance on economic inequality, but superb performance
  on environmental and social health.  Japanese culture is a very peculiar beast: the
  _ethos_ of "we're all in this together" is _very_ strong with them.  So while there's
  certainly _room_ to be culturally exceptional, it's clear Japan does this and the US
  clearly does _not._  

The medicines Wilkinson &amp; Pickett prescribe for our illness are:  
- __More progressive taxation world-wide, to pay for transition to carbon-neutrality.__  In
  the US, for example, the top tax bracket is only 37%, after decades of tax giveaways to
  the wealth &ndash; for most of the 20th century it was 70%.  
- __International agreements must close tax havens and corporate loopholes.__  The
  &uuml;ber-wealthy conceal their wealth in places like the Cayman Islands (as exposed by
  the [Panama Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/panama-papers)), and
  corporations do "inverse mergers" to get their headquarters in tax-favorable places
  unrelated to their actual businesses.  
- __It might be wise to experiment with a _consumption tax:_ a levy paied on income minus
  savings.__  If you save &amp; invest a lot, you don't pay much; if you spend a lot, then
  you get taxed.  This would reduce some of the status-signalling expenditure,
  particularly on the part of the wealthy, though really for all of us.  
- __Global legislation is needed on corporate governance, to ensure that especially the
  large corporations are run fairly and transparently.__  The ratio of top to bottom pay
  rates of more than 200:1 is just not sustainable, since it concentrates wealth in the
  hands of a few while impoverishing the rest.  
  
Will we do that?  Almost certainly not.  

Will we pay the consequences of _not_ doing that?  Almost certainly so.  

### Why _don't_ we reduce inequality?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-nature-b.jpg" width="400" height="252" alt="Nature editorial staff @ Nature: Reducing inequality benefits everyone - so why isn't it happening?" title="Nature editorial staff @ Nature: Reducing inequality benefits everyone - so why isn't it happening?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Our second source today is an unsigned editorial in _Nature._  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
(Again, consider the source here: one of the top-flight science journals.)  

They note as a starting point that researchers from 67 nations wrote an open letter to the
UN Secretary-General and World Bank president urging them to "redouble efforts to address
rising extreme inequality".  This was one of the 17 goals on the UN Sustainable
Development Goals, at which humanity is failing completely, as this goal has been "largely
ignored."  

They point out that Wilkinson &amp; Pickett's _The Spirit Level_ was widely admired among
the political elites&hellip; and widely ignored when they set policy.  That's particularly
frustrating, since research cited by this editorial points out that reducing inequality
would help with _almost all the other sustainability goals._   

> Researchers are right to urge leaders to prioritize inequality. They would do even
> better to study the efforts of Pickett, Wilkinson and others, and determine the reasons
> why these did not bear fruit.  

So&hellip; perhaps we don't address inequality because our leaders don't know
it would help with _almost everything else?_  Or&hellip; perhaps they do know, but
_refuse to believe_ in reducing inequality, as it's antithetical to the interests of the
wealthy and the corporations, who fund their campaigns.  

That's a choice between ignorance and corruption, neither of which is a good look. 

### Maybe stop chasing growth, or at least growth at the cost of all else?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-nature-c.jpg" width="400" height="254" alt="Costanza @ Nature: To build a better world, stop chasing economic growth" title="Costanza @ Nature: To build a better world, stop chasing economic growth" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Our third source today is another commentary in _Nature_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>,
attempting a root cause analysis of our problems.  It places at least some blame on our
relentless pursuit of economic growth, at the expense of literally everything else.  

It cites a startling fact: the bottom 50% of humanity own as much wealth as
_8 individual &uuml;ber-wealthy individuals,_ according to Oxfam in 2017.  

[David Brin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brin) suggests the problem is worse,
since many assets have no clear owner.  All traces disappear into a maze of shell
corporations to conceal ownership and evade taxes.  He proposes a
["world ownership treaty"](https://davidbrin.blogspot.com/2013/12/the-chief-threat-to-our-great.html#:~:text=%3D%3D%20A%20transparency%20alternative%20%3D%3D),
that anything with no
clear ownership can be escheated to a government; holders can avoid this penalty
simply by openly declaring their ownership.  

> Crises are now normal in this global economic system that depletes natural and social
> capital, energy and time in the name of economic growth at all costs.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-ssc-1.jpg" width="400" height="109" alt="Scott Alexander (Siskind) @ SlateStarCodex: Meditations on Moloch" title="Scott Alexander (Siskind) @ SlateStarCodex: Meditations on Moloch" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

If you fetishize economic growth over all else, you are taking Moloch's bargain, in the style of
[Scott Alexander's masterful essay, "Meditations on Moloch"](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/).
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

Moloch is not one of The Good Guys: he was a Canaanite deity, whose bargain was: he gives
you military victory, power, and wealth in exchange for sacrificing everything else you
love, in this case by burning your children to death in a red-hot metal idol.  The video
here is from Fritz Lang's masterful 1927 movie, _Metropolis._ It portrays an upper-class
na&iuml;f discovering the hellish life of workers who are human sacrifices to production
quotas, personified by Moloch as a direct economic comparison.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-04-01-unaffordable-rich-ssc-2.jpg" width="400" height="111" alt="Scott Alexander (Siskind) @ SlateStarCodex: The Goddess of Everything Else" title="Scott Alexander (Siskind) @ SlateStarCodex: The Goddess of Everything Else" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
For a counter to Scott's Moloch essay, see his essay,
[The Goddess of Everything Else](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/17/the-goddess-of-everything-else-2/) <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>:
once in a great while, just very occasionally, emergent phenomena conspire to let us rise
above our social Darwinist origins to pursue social justice.  

It used to be that corporate leaders were capable of pursuing multiple goals: profit for
the shareholders, of course, but also the needs of their workforce, their customers, their
host communities, and so on.  [Milton Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Friedman),
the famous conservative economist, put an end to that: we now pursue growth of shareholder
value, and nothing else, in the fervent, but near-idolatrous, hope that markets provide.  

The article documents the the Beyond Growth conference at the European Parliament,
sponsored by the European Commission.  At least people were _talking_ about moving beyond
GDP, to considering the health and welfare of people.  To be sure, GDP is one component of
welfare, but it's not the only one.  

Indeed, monomaniacal pursuit of economic growth may be the cause of our economic inequality
problems, which in turn are at least a partial cause for all our other problems:  

> As the European conference emphasized, GDP was never designed to measure societal
> well-being — only market production and consumption. GDP says nothing about the
> distribution of income, unpaid work or damages to natural or social capital. The misuse
> of GDP as a policy goal is driving societies towards an unsustainable future that
> benefits an increasingly small proportion of the population while impoverishing the vast
> majority.  

They propose that we should (a) develop better measures of social well-being, (b) model
the complex dynamics of those measures in our economic system, and (c) set policy
accordingly.  

It sounds hard to argue against that, but I have a deep and bitter faith in people's
endless ability to obstruct anything that leads to a better life.  

### Maybe 'rich enough' includes a lot of people?  

It may be, of course, that people fear reduction in economic inequality will reduce their
own wealth.  To that end, it's worth considering how likely that is.  

In the US, one can be reasonably prosperously retired, even in a high cost of living area,
if one pays off all debt and saves a couple million dollars.  That's a lot of money, to be
sure.  But it's _not_ unattainable if one remains employed and saves at a reasonable rate
in a tax-sheltered retirement plan (IRA, Roth IRA, 401(k), Roth 401(k)) over a career.  

Indeed, right here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads, we wrote
[a piece on Stanley &amp; Danko's _Millionaire Next Door_]({{ site.baseurl }}/bayes-mnd/). <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
We pointed out that it's very difficult indeed to join the top 1% in wealth, but it's not
terribly difficult to have a pretty good shot at the top 10%, or 20% worst case.  

Being in the top 1/5th of the wealth distribution is a reasonably comfortable outcome for
a career.  These are not the &uuml;ber-wealthy!  They're just middle-class people who
saved for the future.  Taxation aimed at the multi-billionaires is not even going to be
noticeable for them, except that everything else around them gets better.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

["Eat the rich"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_the_rich) is a popular slogan among
young folks in the West now.  Better slogans might be: "tax the rich", and "expose the rich" to
public scrutiny of what they own.
