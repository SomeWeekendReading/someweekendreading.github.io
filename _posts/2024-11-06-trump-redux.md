So&hellip; Trump again.  Honestly, I don't know how we survive this.  Survive as a
planetary civilization, survive as democracies, or even how I survive personally.  I just
don't know how to gather the energy to live through this.  

## Elegies  

> The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;  
> Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;  
> Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;  
> For nothing now can ever come to any good.  
>  &mdash; [WH Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden), ["Funeral Blues"](https://allpoetry.com/funeral-blues)  

> Nature’s first green is gold,  
> Her hardest hue to hold.  
> Her early leaf’s a flower;  
> But only so an hour.  
>  
> Then leaf subsides to leaf.  
> So Eden sank to grief,  
> So dawn goes down to day.  
> Nothing gold can stay.  
>  &mdash; [Robert Frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost), ["Nothing Gold Can Stay"](https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay)  

For those who somehow thought this election not important enough to vote, we invite your
consideration:  

> ["One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors." &ndash; Plato, __Republic__, Book 1, 347c.]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COne%20of%20the%20penalties%20for%20refusing%20to%20participate%20in%20politics%20is%20that%20you%20end%20up%20being%20governed%20by%20your%20inferiors.%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%93%20Plato%2C%20Republic%2C%20Book%201%2C%20347c.)  

As [EB White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._B._White) wrote in an essay in
[_The New Yorker_](https://www.newyorker.com/) on 1944-Jul-03 (later collected into
[_On Democracy_](https://www.harpercollins.com/products/on-democracy-e-b-white) in 1947):  

> Democracy is the recurrent suspicion that more than half of the people are right more
> than half of the time.  

This is the _other_ half of the time: half of us are proudly ignorant and venomously racist.  

I don't quite see, yet, how the rest of us can survive that.
