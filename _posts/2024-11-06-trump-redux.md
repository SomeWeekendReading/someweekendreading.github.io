So&hellip; Trump again.  Honestly, I don't know how we survive this.  Survive as a
planetary civilization, survive as democracies, or even how I survive personally.  I just
don't know how to gather the energy to live through this.  

## Elegies  

> The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;  
> Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;  
> Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;  
> For nothing now can ever come to any good.  
>  &mdash; [WH Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden), ["Funeral Blues"](https://allpoetry.com/funeral-blues)  

> Nature’s first green is gold,  
> Her hardest hue to hold.  
> Her early leaf’s a flower;  
> But only so an hour.  
>  
> Then leaf subsides to leaf.  
> So Eden sank to grief,  
> So dawn goes down to day.  
> Nothing gold can stay.  
>  &mdash; [Robert Frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Frost), ["Nothing Gold Can Stay"](https://poets.org/poem/nothing-gold-can-stay)
