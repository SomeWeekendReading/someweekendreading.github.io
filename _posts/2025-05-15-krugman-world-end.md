Paul Krugman asks: Is this the year we doom civilization?  Because it's come to that.  


## Krugman?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-pk-1.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="Paul Krugman @ Substack: The Year We Doom Civilization?" title="Paul Krugman @ Substack: The Year We Doom Civilization?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Paul Krugman: famous academic economist (MIT, Yale, Princeton, now CUNY), Nobel laureate,
and former _New York Times_ columnist (until the pusillanimous editors began watering down
his columns).  He's now on Substack (which, as a platform, is sometimes regrettable and
sometimes readable).  His latest <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> is about our generally
stupidity around green energy, preferring to subsidize fossil fuels that feed the greed of
our oligarchs.  

It's actually enough to doom civilization: a _bad_ version of climate change, which is
where we are determinedly headed, would collapse agriculture, ignite more pandemics, and
flood coastal cities worldwide.  Between the famine, deadly heat waves, pandemics, and
worldwide depression, that could end our civilization.  

No, I mean that: literally.  


## Doom 1: Economic Stupidity  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-irena.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-irena-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="IRENA: Renewables are now CHEAPER than fossil fuels" title="IRENA: Renewables are now CHEAPER than fossil fuels" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
A lot of it is frustrating because it's economically _stupid_ to avoid green energy and
the shutdown of fossil fuel extraction.  

Green energy is now _cheaper_ than fossil fuels, as shown in this graph Krugman exhibits
from the International Renewable Energy Agency. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
Over the last decade and a half, we have had quite a series of miracles happen in solar
and wind energy.  As you can see, green energy in all forms is comparable to fossil
energy, and in most cases cheaper.  (The only near tie involves solar concentrators, which
take huge expensive mirror arrays.  Even they are _comparable_ to fossil fuels.  (__NB:__
"LCOE" on the vertical axis is the "levelized cost of energy", i.e., fairly accounting for
the cost of building and operating facilities.)  

The only conclusion a reasonable person can draw is that there remains _no reason whatsoever_
to continue fossil fuel production and consumption.  

However&hellip; fossil fuels accrue wealth to the incumbent corporations and the oligarchs
who own them.  They would _very_ much prefer to keep their high status, regardless of
costs to the public.  And in our wounded political system, they can just buy a government
of Republicans who will do exactly that: support existing private wealth concentrations over
public wealth.  

There are no subsidies needed for green energy any more, just get out of the way and
_stop subsidizing oil!_  Unfortunately, as Krugman cites in this article from the 
_Houston Chronicle_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, our politicians are extremely
hostile to that idea:  

> Texas Republicans are getting closer than ever to killing the state’s renewable energy
> boom, according to the clean energy industry — not only by halting new development in its
> tracks, but also by possibly sending scores of existing projects to an early grave.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-eia.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-eia.jpg" width="400" height="271" alt="EIA: Wind &amp; solar take off in response to lower costs" title="EIA: Wind &amp; solar take off in response to lower costs" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
At the same time, we can see that the market sees through this political charade.  One
need only look at the growth of installed capacity for green energy over the years.  Wind
and solar capacity is clearly expanding rapidly (possibly exponentially, but I haven't
tested that statistically).  This is happening on a scale of trillion-BTU levels, i.e., The
Big Time.  

It's just all so _stupid:_ we could _all_ be prosperous and secure with green energy, or
we cold keep paying oligarchs to ruin climate, collapse agriculture, and flood coastal
cities worldwide.  

Krugman summarizes the naked irrationality of it all in the Republican mind:  

> Why does MAGA hate renewables? They consider them woke because they help fight climate
> change, which they insist is a hoax. And they’re cleaner than burning fossil fuels,
> which means that they aren’t manly.  

The choice is obvious to all but the rich and the conservatives.  


## Doom 2: Incumbent Political Spending  

Just in case you doubt that fossil fuel interests are backing Republicans in their attempt
to destroy democracy, let's look at their donation patterns.  Using data from
[Open Secrets](https://www.opensecrets.org/), Krugman shows us where fossil fuel money and
alternative energy political donations go.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-fossil-gop.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-fossil-gop-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="196" alt="Open Secrets: Fossil fuel political spending is overwhelmingly Republican" title="Open Secrets: Fossil fuel political spending is overwhelmingly Republican" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-alt-dem.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-alt-dem-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="197" alt="Open Secrets: Alternative energy is overwhelmingly Democratic, but 7x smaller" title="Open Secrets: Alternative energy is overwhelmingly Democratic, but 7x smaller" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

- The first bar chart shows fossil fuel political donations over time, with Republicans coded in
  red and Democrats coded in blue.  
- Similarly, the second bar chart shows alternative energy donations over the same time
  period, with the same colors.  
- Note the dominance of fossil fuels for Republicans and alternative energy for
  Democrats.  
- Before you try to "well, both sides do it" to me, you should know that I will whack
  you across the face with a sock stuffed with clues if you try that!  
  
  Look carefully at the vertical scales: _the fossil fuel political donations to
  Republicans are 7x larger than alternative energy donations to Democrats!_  

This is _clearly_ a case of private wealth concentrations defending the _status quo_,
basically bribing their way into a compliant, but lawless, Republican government.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

This is not just a preference in favor of fossil fuels.  This is evil.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-15-krugman-world-end-tnr-1.jpg" width="200" height="288" alt="Varkiani @ TNR: DHS Secy Noem says habeas corpus is the right of the president to deport you" title="Varkiani @ TNR: DHS Secy Noem says habeas corpus is the right of the president to deport you" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
It is of a part with the dismantling of science, the censorship of public health, the
revenge against law firms, and all the rest.  It is of a piece with the barbaric statement
of DHS Secretary Noem, on the right of _habeas corpus_ <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>:  

> Well, habeas corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to
> remove people from this country &hellip;  

&hellip; at which point she was, thankfully, interrupted by incandescently irate Congress folk.  

That is, she thinks this bedrock principle is a _right of the president_ to deport people,
not a _right of the people_ to due process and against arbitrary detention.  In
follow-ups, she thought the president could suspend it at will when only
Congress can do that, and only in time of domestic warfare (like the Civil War).  

They're destroying fundamental civil liberties so they can kidnap innocent people from the
street to be sent to torture prisons in El Salvador.  

All this to enrich the oligarchs and preserve their position.  

Time to tax them out of existence, down to "mere" hundred millionaires.  Also time for a
Presidential Crimes Commission, to send the politicians responsible to jail, along with
the willing thugs of ICE.
