It's been a month since we were exposed to COVID-19 here at Ch&acirc;teau
Weekend, testing positive 2 days later.  Surely it must all be over, right?  Right?  Ahem.  


## The sound of fat ladies not _quite_ singing

Fat ladies are not, as yet, singing.  Or at least, they are singing _very_ softly.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-23-covid-1-month-later-test-1.jpg" width="400" height="82" alt="Your humble Weekend Editor is now persistently negative, as is the Weekend Editrix" title="Your humble Weekend Editor is now persistently negative, as is the Weekend Editrix" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Yes, we both test negative.  Yes, symptoms have largely abated.  But we're both weak as
kittens, and get utterly, deathly tired &amp; achy &amp; crabby by mid-afternoon.  Not
just "tired", but having actual difficulty cooking dinner because even standing up to eat feels
like a lot of work.  

While we're not totally incapacitated, having to work for a living would be difficult.
Fortunately, your humble Weekend Editor is retired, and the Weekend Editrix works mostly
from home.  There are a number of blog posts that should have happened, except I can't do
anything other than sit and stare at a wall after 2pm.  

But&hellip; things are getting better.  Slowly.  


## Other things that are getting better  

The world is still in the grips of climate change causing droughts severe enough to make
parts of even the developed world uninhabitable.  The incredibly stupid Russian invasion
of Ukraine continues insensibly.  The world slouches toward fascism.  Trump is not yet
indicted, let alone in prison.  

So yeah, we got problems.  

But at least a couple things are going well, or at least in the right direction:  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-23-covid-1-month-later-reuters-1.jpg" width="400" height="218" alt="Reuters: FDA asks Pfizer to trial 2nd course of paxlovid for rebound infections" title="Reuters: FDA asks Pfizer to trial 2nd course of paxlovid for rebound infections" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
1. _Reuters_ reports <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> that the FDA has asked Pfizer to run
   a clinical trial to test the
   utility of a 2nd course of paxlovid in people who get rebound infections.  As you'll recall from
   [our experience of rebound infection here at Chez Weekend]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-rebound/),
   we strongly support this.  (Yes, it's _COVID-19 rebound_, not paxlovid rebound, since
   the rebound rates with and without paxlovid are statistically indistinguishable.)  Still, when we
   asked for a second course of paxlovid, our doc fell back on the "CDC says there's no
   evidence" line.  In spite of all the mechanistic evidence and case report evidence.  So
   it'll be good to see a test of longer courses of paxlovid to shut down the virus and
   keep it shut down.  

   The trial is supposed to have its design finalized next month, which means if
   everything marches along smartly we can expect a readout by the end of the year and an
   FDA/CDC decision early in 2023.  Yes, we all wish it were faster than that.  
   
   Ideally, I'd just like them to test a 10-day course of paxlovid for everybody, instead
   of 5 days + 5 more days if you get a rebound and your doc is up-to-date and feels like
   being cooperative.  Just because expecting the healthcare system to respond to
   complexity is&hellip; expecting too much.  

   And frankly, we now know rebounds are pretty common, with our without paxlovid.  And
   here at Chez Weekend, we know they're no fun.  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-23-covid-1-month-later-pfizer-1.jpg" width="400" height="418" alt="Pfizer &amp; BioNTech: FDA submission of multivalent vaccine for EUA" title="Pfizer &amp; BioNTech: FDA submission of multivalent vaccine for EUA" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
2. Pfizer and BioNTech have submitted to the FDA the EUA application for their bivalent
   booster vaccine. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> (Yes, that's a press release.  And
   yes, we hate press releases here at Chez Weekend.  But sometimes, it's all ya got.)
   They are also doing rolling submissions with the EMA for European approval.  They're
   following
   [the FDA guidance from this summer about which we blogged last June]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-vrbpac-variant-boosters/),
   and have begun "at-risk" manufacturing so they'll be able to ship immediately upon
   grant of EUA.  (I checked
   [the FDA advisory committee calendar](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar),
   and as of today see no VRBPAC meeting about EUA for Omicron-specific vaccines, either
   Pfizer or Moderna.  Get on that, will ya, FDA folk? Thanks.)  
   
   It's described as bivalent, albeit in a peculiar way:  

   > The bivalent vaccine contains mRNA encoding the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein,
   > which is present in the original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, together with mRNA
   > encoding the spike protein of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 variant.  

   This makes me wonder: if it contains spike mRNA from the classic, Omicron/BA.4, and
   Omicron/BA.5 variants, isn't that trivalent?  Or do the latter 2 variants share an
   identical spike protein?  In any case, it looks to be generating strong antibodies to
   the original, Omicron/BA.1, Omicron/BA.4, and Omicron/BA.5 variants.  Given the
   crosstalk of the original vaccination, it probably gets the variants inbetween, as
   well, though that does not seem to have been measured.  
   
   Moderna is expected to follow quickly.  I've been impressed all throughout the pandemic
   that the fast, nimble biotech Moderna is always 2nd to apply for approval after the
   stodgy, slow big pharma Pfizer.  I'd love to know why that is.  
   
   (But I'm grateful they're both there.  Given my recent deeply unpleasant COVID-19
   experience, even with vaccination and paxlovid, they're probably the _reason_ I'm still
   here.)  

   Alas, this upcoming booster is probably the last one that will be free, unless Congress
   acts.  And you know how hard it is to get Congress to do _anything_, with so many
   Republicans ready to obstruct _everything_.  So after this, the drug companies will set
   prices and the insurance companies will decide how much we pay.  

   Happy nightmares on that front.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

So, at least a couple things are headed in the right direction.  

Now if only we can blow up enough Russian military equipment, indict/try/convict Trump and his
Republican enablers, keep the House for the Democrats &amp; add 2 vertebrate Democrats to
the Senate to neuter Senators Manchin &amp; Sinema <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, then
we'll be in a position to make some real progress.  For the first time in many years.  

A tall order!
