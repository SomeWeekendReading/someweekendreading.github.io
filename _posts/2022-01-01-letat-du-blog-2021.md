A full calendar year of blogging has passed.  So, thankfully, has the _annus
horribilis_ 2021CE.  How did we come out?  (The blog, that is.  2021 itself is still too
traumatizing to discuss.)  


## When the Greeks count time by the kalends  

[Fiat blog](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/fiat-blog/) was on 2020-Jul-01, my
[first day of retirement](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/retirement-of-iphegenia/).
Just now, the year ended on 2021-Dec-31.  

According to the
[TimeAndDate.com duration calculator](https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=7&d1=1&y1=2020&m2=12&d2=31&y2=2021&ti=on),
549 days have elapsed total, 365 of which were in calendar 2021 proper.  So we've been
writng this crummy little blog that nobody reads for almost exactly a year and a half:  

$$
\frac{549 \mbox{ days}}{365.24 \mbox{ days/yr}} = 1.503 \mbox{ yr}
$$

The year-end is a time for retrospection and introspection.  And since it's the
sesqui-blogiversary, let's see how things have gone.  For that purpose, I've written a
little [R script](https://www.r-project.org) to analyze post/comment/hit statistics and
test for trends over time, the relationship between comments and hit counts,
etc.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  (Excluding this post itself, of course, for
obvious reasons!)  

The results of this script are available in the Notes &amp; References below for:  
- Calendar year 2020 (6 months starting 2020-Jul-01) <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  
- Calendar year 2021 (all 12 months) <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  
- All years combined (18 months) <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

__Conclusion:__ [_Calculemus!_](http://course1.winona.edu/KSuman/Dictionary/Fill%20Ins/Calculemus.htm)  


## Frequencies of posts, comments, and hits  

So first let's use the script's output (saved in spreadsheets in the Notes &amp;
References) to get an idea of how many posts and comments there were in 2020 and 2021, and
some idea of the average rate.  The script has this built in already, so from the
transcript we can extract this nifty little table:  

| __Year__ | | __NPosts__ | | __NDays__ | | __NComments__ | | __DaysPerPost__ | | __DaysPerComment__ |
| --------:|-| ----------:|-| ---------:|-| -------------:|-| ---------------:|-| ------------------:|
| 2020     | | 41         | | 184       | | 21            | | 4.49            | | 8.76               |
| 2021     | | 111        | | 365       | | 58            | | 3.29            | | 6.29               |
| Total    | | 152        | | 549       | | 79            | | 3.61            | | 6.95               |

- Recall that we started blogging in mid-2020, so only half the days of 2020 are
  available.  So the Null Hypothesis is: twice as much activity in 2021 compared to 2020.  
- That being said, we have more than twice as many posts in 2021, so the posting rate has
  gone up a little bit.  
- The comments have gone up triple instead of just double, so there's a real increase
  there.  (Though starting from a low base, it's now "just slightly above very low".)  
- It looks like we were posting just a tad over twice a week (every 3.29 days), a slightly
  higher rate than last year.  Our goal was once a week, so that's more or less ok.  
- The comment rate went up also, now about 1ce/week.  However, since I reply to most
  comments, the rate of comments from _actual_ readers is still a lowish value of 1
  comment about every 2 weeks.  
- The number of comments per post is remarkably steady, and dismally low:  
  - 2020 saw 21/41 = 0.51 comments per post  
  - 2021 saw 58/111 = 0.52 comments per post  
  - Overall, that's 79/152 = 0.52 comments per post.  
  
__Conclusion:__ This is still a blog you can keep up with by reading once a week.  Also,
for some mysterious reason I get more comments via email than the comment system.  


## Hits and comments in relation to time  

That's been mostly about _writing_ posts.  What about _reading?_  

To investigate readership, we'll next look at the post hits vs time (regrettably including
my own looking at the posts searching for errors and things to rephrase), and comments vs
time.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-post-stats-2021-yearend.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-post-stats-2021-yearend-thumb.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Hits and Comments vs Time: Year 2021" title="Hits and Comments vs Time: Year 2021" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here's the hits vs time and comments vs time for 2021 (click to embiggen).  The 4 plots
are:  
1. _Top right:_ Hits vs time.  The horizontal axis is time; the vertical axis is the number
   of hits on a log scale.  Each blue point is a post.  The black curve is the LOESS curve
   (sort of like a local curve fit); the gray band is the 95% confidence interval on the
   LOESS curve.  The vertical dashed line is when hit tracking was turned on; hits before
   this date represent people looking through the back catalog of posts.  
2. _Top left:_ Histogram of hit counts.  This gives you an idea of the probability
   distribution of hits.  
3. _Lower left:_ Comments vs time.  The horizontal axis is time; the vertical axis is
   number of comments (linear scale).  Each blue point is a post.  The LOESS curves are as
   previously explained.  
4. _Lower right:_ Histogram of comment counts.  This gives you an idea of the probability
   distribution of comments per post.  
   
The conclusions seem pretty clear:  

- Hits increased dramatically in Q2, when I started leaving comments on other blogs.  
- The increase is dominated by 5 outliers, all of which were live-blogging FDA hearings on
  COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.  
- The trend since then has been to relax downward, but above where it was at the beginning
  of the year.  
- Most posts get under 100 hits. There is a smallish group with 100-200 hits, and the rest
  are a few outliers.  
- Comments are rare!  Most posts get none, and everything else is an outlier.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-post-stats-2020-yearend.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-post-stats-2020-yearend-thumb.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Hits and Comments vs Time: Year 2020" title="Hits and Comments vs Time: Year 2020" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
For comparison, here's the same analysis restricted to 2020 only (just the 2nd half of the
year; click to embiggen).  

For 2020, we see that hits just bumbled along steadily, generally under 40 hits/post.
Comments were also quite rare.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-post-stats-omnibus.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-post-stats-omnibus-thumb.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Hits and Comments vs Time: All Years" title="Hits and Comments vs Time: All Years" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
And here's the omnibus dataset, looking at all data from the blog's Big Bang through
today (click to embiggen).  

This shows the same sort of conclusions, just more firmly stated with more data:  
- In 2020, the hit rate was around 30 hits/post; after 2021 Q2 the rate went above 100
  hits/post; accounting for the 5 high outliers indicates a background rate of maybe 50
  hits/post.  
- Comments are still rare.  The rising LOESS curve for comments would be encouraging,
  except that nearly all the probability mass is on the horizontal axis at 0 comments.  

__Conclusion:__ Still a crummy little blog that nobody reads, _unless_ I write about an
FDA hearing for medications against life-threatening pandemic diseases, and advertise that
fact in the comments section of a high-traffic blog.  


## Are there more comments on high-hit posts?  

As long as we're thinking about comments, we might want to entertain the hypothesis that
there are more comments on posts with more hits.  After all, hits are people looking; the
more people who look the greater the cumulative chance that somebody will comment, right?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-post-stats-2021-yearend-2.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Comment/Hit Bicluster: Year 2021" title="Comment/Hit Bicluster: Year 2021" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-post-stats-2021-yearend-3.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Comment/Hit Regression: Year 2021" title="Comment/Hit Regression: Year 2021" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
To investigate such a relationship in 2021, we'll first do an exploratory bicluster of comment
counts vs hit counts (top figure), and then a linear-log regression of comments on log
hits.  
- The bicluster is shown on top:  
  - The color shows the number of posts with a given number of hits and number of
    comments.  
  - The rows are just the number of comments.  
  - The hits have been reduced to a rank, i.e., a decile.  This is to take care of
    outliers, i.e., the one post that got $O(1200)$ hits.  (It plays the same role as the
    log transform in the regression, _q.v._  They are shown in the columns.  
  - The row and column dendrograms permute the rows and permute the columns until the ones
    that most resemble each other are adjacent.  The length of a leg of the dendrogram
    indicates the statistical significance of the split.  
  - _Hit dendrogam:_  Basically, there's one outlier column at the 80%-ile in hits but
    which has 0 comments.  The rest of the columns are more or less the same; _maybe_ a
    higher and lower hit group, but at very much less significance.  This is not great
    evidence for a hit/comment relationship!  
  - _Comment dendrogram:_  Here the story is brutally clear: the 0-comment row stands out
    with most of the posts, and any number of hits above 0 makes them all look almost
    identical.  
  - We conclude that the 0-comment posts stand apart, and there is weak to no evidence of
    more hits leading to more comments.  
- The linear-log regression is shown on the bottom:  
  - Each post is a blue dot.  
  - The horizontal axis is the number of hits, on a log scale.  The rug on the horizontal
    axis gives you some idea of the (log) density of hits.  
  - The vertical axis is the number of comments for each post.  The rug on the vertical
    axis is uninformative, as there are only 7 levels.  
  - The gray curves gives you an idea of the joint density (from kernel density
    estimation by convolution with a gaussian of appropriate bandwidth).  It definitely
    says most of the probability is concentrated along the horizontal axis, i.e., 0
    comments.  
  - The red line is the regression line.  
    - On the one hand, it _is_ statistically significant, i.e., probably real: the
      $F$-statistic for the overall regression has $p \sim 0.013$, and the $t$-statistic
      for the slope coefficient does as well.  
	- However, the strength of the prediction is miserable with an adjusted $R^2 \sim 4.7\%$,
      i.e., log hits explains only 4.7% of the variance in comments.  

```
Call:
lm(formula = PostComments ~ log(PostHits), data = postData)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max

```

It seems clear that a na&iuml;ve linear model is useless here.  While the nonzero comment
points may have a mild trend, the 0 point comments drag the regresion into sillyspace.
Perhaps something like tobit regression would be more appropriate?  A topic for next
year.

If you look back at 2020 only, you get similar results, except with even fewer hits.  Keep
in mind, though, that hit counting only started in mid-2021.  So all these hits represent
people looking at the back catalog of posts.  They might even be mostly me, referring to
back posts to remember what they said, proofreading for errors, etc.

Finally, we can also look at the overall model from
[Fiat blog](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/fiat-blog/) in mid-2020, through the end
of 2021.  It appears the conclusions are unchanged from those of 2021 alone:  
- The 0-comment posts cluster apart from the others in the comment/hit bicluster.  
- The regression model, while statistically significant, only predicts about $R^2 \sim 4.1\%$ 
  of the variance in comments from knowledge of the hits.  

```
Call:
lm(formula = PostComments ~ log(PostHits), data = postData)

Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max

Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 1.16 on 150 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.04698,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.04062 
F-statistic: 7.394 on 1 and 150 DF,  p-value: 0.007318
```

__Conclusion:__ Most posts get 0 comments.  While there is statistical significance to a
putative comment/hit relationship, the strength of prediction is essentially nothing.  A
more signficant model involving cutoffs, like tobit regression, will be fun to explore at
in year-end post for 2022.  


## The boring nature of spam and the (blessedly infrequent) nastygrams  

There's still lots of spam, mostly in Russian.  I haven't broken it down by year (perhaps
I will do so next year?), but overall nearly every comment submitted is spam.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-omnibus-pull-requests.jpg" width="400" height="174" alt="Pull requests as of 2021-Dec-31" title="Pull requests as of 2021-Dec-31" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Last year I did a spiffy little analysis by hand-removing my own comments, that I submitted to
respond to others.  I won't do that here, because I haven't automated it yet.  So without
breaking down by year and removing my own comments, we have 444 pull requests (see image
of the Pull Request tab from the blog's GitHub repository).  There have also been 79
accepted comments (including my own, bogusly):  

```sh
$ find ./_data/comments/ -iname "*.yml" -a -type f -a -exec grep "^name: .*" \{\} \; | wc -l
79
```

Assuming comments arrive with a certain binomial probability $p$, our Bayesian posterior
Beta distribution on $p$ assuming a uniform uninformative prior is:  

```R
> 100.0 * round(qbeta(c(0.025, 0.500, 0.975), 444 - 79 + 1, 79 + 1), digits = 3)
[1] 78.4 82.1 85.5
```

So the probability a pull request is spam or other worthlessness is 82.1% with a 95%
confidence interval of 78.4% &ndash; 85.5%.  

__Conclusion:__ The spammers are persistent but hopeless, since I let absolutely none of
it through.  It's impressive their bots can get past my bot filter in the comment form,
but unimpressive that they _never learn._  


## Google search console and its discontents  

We can also use [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about) to
see things like how often we come up in Google searches, what the search queries were, how often
people clicked through, and what other web pages link to us.  

### Search appearances and click-through rate  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-omnibus-google-search-console.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-omnibus-google-search-console-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="218" alt="SomeWeekendReading.blog: Gooogle search console 2020-Jul-01 to 2021-Dec-31" title="SomeWeekendReading.blog: Gooogle search console 2020-Jul-01 to 2021-Dec-31" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The plot (click to embiggen) shows the number of times we appeared in a Google search
(purple line, right-hand vertical axis) and the number of times there was a click through
(blue line, left-hand vertical axis).  

We have a pretty low click-through rate of 2.2%, which means as far as Google searchers are
concerned, this really is a crummy little blog that nobody reads.  And I'm _still_ ok with that.  

As with last year, most of the clicks were from the Anglosphere, the top countries being:
US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, India, Phillipines, Spain, Sweden, Austria&hellip;  My
former French colleagues are conspicuous by their absence!  (Maybe they're reading, just
not searching for this blog via Google.  Yeah, that's the ticket.)  

By device, there were about 2.5x as many clicks on a desktop computer as mobile.  Tablets
were just a minor contribution.  Google _says_ this crummy little blog that nobody reads
is mobile-friendly, but it looks _much_ better on a real screen instead of a dinky little
phone screen.  

### Search queries  

The Google search queries that got click-throughs to this crummy little blog that nobody
reads are just plain _weird:_  
- The highest one, at 72 clicks, was "yle editrix".  That's a mash-up of the abbreviation
  for [Your Local Epidemiologist](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/) and the
  Weekend Editrix.  I mean, they're both smart women, but&hellip; &Gammad;&Tau;&Phi;?!  
- Next at 10 clicks was "hank green vaccine" or "hank green covid vaccine", a
  r&eacute;prise of last year's result that posts mentioning Internet-famous people draw
  large amounts of clicks.  Celebrity culture in action.  
- Next was "filibuster statistics by party", which is the first one that makes sense: it
  was something I actually wrote about!  
  
After that, it's just minor stuff with 1 click on various inanities.  

### Linked pages, link text, and link text  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-omnibus-linked-pages.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-omnibus-linked-pages-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="SomeWeekendReading.blog: Pages with frequent outside links" title="SomeWeekendReading.blog: Pages with frequent outside links" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The outside link report says we are linked to by 224 unique outside links.  Most of them
link to the front page, along with some others about FDA hearings on COVID-19 vaccines and
therapeutics.  I guess that makes sense.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-omnibus-linking-sites.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-01-letat-du-blog-2021-omnibus-linking-sites-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="316" alt="SomeWeekendReading.blog: Outside linking sites" title="SomeWeekendReading.blog: Outside linking sites" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

The sites from which those links come make sense, mostly.  Wordpress.com is the host for
most of the web nowadays, and a couple blogs on which I comment use that.
Balloon-juice.com, lesswrong.com, goodmath.org, GaryCornell.com, and so on are other blogs
where I've left comments.  (GreaterWrong.com appears to be an alternative format mirror of
LessWrong.com.)  There are, of course, also a few weird linking sites that appear to be
pointless link farms.  

I don’t do any promotion for this blog: no Twittage, no Instagrammaton, no FaceBorg,
nothing. The only things I do are (a) mention it to people in conversation or email when
it’s relevant, and (b) very occasionally leave comments on somebody else’s blog. The
linking sites confirm this, being mostly places I’ve left comments on other blogs and the
few inevitable internet weirdos.  (Am _I_ an internet weirdo?  Quite possibly&hellip;)

Finally, the text they put in their links to this blog is&hellip; puzzling.  I'm just
looking here to see if people refer to me as "that idiot", or something equally amusing.  
- The most frequent, understandably, is my _nom de blog_: Weekend Editor.  Fair enough.  
- But the second ranking one is "fda declares war on america".  I think that guy is
  probably not paying attention to what I say?  Or using me as a stupid example contrary
  to his position?  
- Some of the rest I recognize as links other people have put in their blogs, linking back
  to me.  
- And, of course, this being the internet, some are just bizarre and incomprehensible: the
  empty string, "11", "three", "two", "alain alameddine image" (apparently a French translator?),
  "rankvirus com", "tarekomi xyz", and so on.  

__Conclusion:__ 
- Ok, it's not like _nobody_ reads this blog.  There are a few readers, small in number
  but deeply crazed.  Sort of like me.  
- Google search hits are more or less useless, with a low click-through rate based on
  people looking for internet-famous personalities.  
- Most readers are in the Anglosphere, and use desktops or laptops, a few phones and
  almost no tablets.  
- Linkage comes mostly from places where I've left comments and gotten (very minor)
  notice.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Modulo a few more hits on popular posts, pretty much the same as 
[the last time we took stock]({{ site.baseurl }}/state-of-blog-1yr):  

>This is still a crummy little blog that nobody reads.  
>
>And I'm still ok with that.  
>
>There are a few links, mostly from the comment sections of a few blogs we're I've
>dropped in to say something.  I'm not interested in doing promotion work, or monetization.
>I _might_ look into Google Ads and some minor promotion someday, once I get the stylesheet
>stuff straightened out, but also maybe not.  So don't hold your breath on that.  
>
>To my spammers: You're hopeless.  You'll never make it past moderation.  Move along.  
>
>To my readers (all 3 of you, excluding my spouse, my cat, and myself): Thanks for reading.
>I'm gratified at the couple of you that have expressed interest.  Please feel free to
>leave comments; it makes me happy to engage with thoughtful people.
