It's that special time of year again&hellip; Krampusnacht!  


## Who?  

Yes, it's that special time of year.  No, not Christmas.  I mean December 5, Krampusnacht!  

One of the nicer folk-myths around European Christianity is a visit from the rather gentle
St Nicholas, encouraging goodness in children.  Of course this is thoroughly corrupted
with greed for presents, but at least the seed was one of kindness.  

A rather bizarre turn is that we just can't seem to leave a good thing alone, but must
always go full-on [Manichean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manichaeism) by introducing a
dark counterpart.  Like the Babylonian exile exposed Jews to Zoroastrianism which raised the
profile of the Satan <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, we seem fascinated with good/evil
counterparts instead of just concerning ourselves with good.

And so it is, even with the gentle St Nicholas and his cartoonish successor Santa Claus.
In Alpine folklore, he is accompanied by (not "opposed by"; they always come together) a
figure called Krampus. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  St Nicholas blesses the good
children, and Krampus&hellip; well, he has business with the bad children:
- He's always described as dark and hairy, with the horns of a goat and a long pointed
  tongue.  (Sometimes ridiculously long, as in he can pick up children with his tongue.)  
- He carries chains and manacles, either to represent the binding of the Devil or with
  which to bind bad children.  
- One foot is a cloven hoof, while the other is mysteriously not.  
- He carries birch rods with which to whip _moderately_ bad children.  
- He also has a basket or a bag, for children who are more _spectacularly_ talented at being
  bad.  He's said to stuff them in the basket, kidnapping them either to be drowned, or
  eaten, or taken to Hell.  (Or, in some versions to Spain.  No idea why Hell and Spain
  should be so linked?)  

(I wonder if the American phrase "going to hell in a handbasket" is related to Krampus and
his basket?)  

Thus the traditions of the more remote Alpine places, where conformity with suspicions by
the distant medieval church could be regarded as rather more optional.  Today, it's
supposed to be a fun thing to do with kids, complete with parades.  

People dress up as Krampus and scare children, in what I'm sure the children think is a
totally fun prank.  Occasionally after attempting to birch a child, parents feel inspired
to punch out a Krampus cosplayer, which I'm sure is also totally fun trip to local hospitals.  

_Krampusnacht_, or Krampus Night, is December 5th.  St Nicholas and Krampus visit houses
with children for gentle congratulations &amp; blessings from St Nicholas&hellip; or rather
more boisterous moral instruction from Krampus.  

Here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, we're happy to see that all of you have survived Krampusnacht
without deportation to Spain (or even warmer places).  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Speaking of deportation, perhaps the esteemed Mr. Krampus could come evaluate Mr. Trump
for suitability to be put  in his basket?  I mean, they're both all about deportation, and as
long as we're fantasizing&hellip;
