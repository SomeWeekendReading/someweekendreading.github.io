Russian dead in Ukraine: now more than 1,100,000.

Here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), we've for some time been
having&hellip; _opinions_ about Ukraine.

It is, very regrettably, time for an update.  

As we've been saying for a couple years now, we're tracking the Russian casualty figures
provided by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence:

Sadly, it appears the Russians have now wasted the lives of another 100,000 of their young
men for a total of 1.1 million so far in their invasion of Ukraine:  

<a href="https://x.com/DefenceU/status/1969665345385546176"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-22-ukraine-1100k-ukr-mod-1.jpg" width="550" height="818" alt="Ukraine Ministry of Defence: More than 1,100,000 Russian dead" title="Ukraine Ministry of Defence: More than 1,100,000 Russian dead" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

As we've previously remarked, this is continuing to blow a hole in Russian demographics of
18-44 year old males, i.e., those more or less qualified for military service.  By our
reckoning:  

$$
144\ \mbox{million Russians} \times 0.5\ \mbox{males} \times 1/3\ \mbox{military age} = 23.7\ \mbox{million}
$$

So 1.1 million dead is about $100\% \times 1.1 \mbox{million} / 23.7 \mbox{million} = 4.6\%$

- Add to that reports that approximately 900,000 Russian men of military age have left
  Russia to avoid the draft.  
- Then add that [Russian casualties from COVID-19]() seem to be around 400,000
  <sup id="fn15a">[[15]](#fn15)</sup>.  Applying that to half the population to get males
  and then 1/3 to get those of military age means a loss of about an additional 67k men of
  military age.  
  
Together the Russian emigration and COVID-19 deaths give us about an extra million, for a
total loss of about 2.1 million, or about 8.8% of the Russian men of military service age.

That's&hellip; _staggering._  As we've quoted Bertrand Russel on this subject before:  

> "The mark of a civilized man is the capacity to read a column of numbers and weep."
> &ndash; Bertrand Russell, who said things like this if not exactly this, but would in
> any case almost certainly agree with the sentiment  

When we look at the deaths in Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the deaths in Israel's
invasion of Gaza, the wholesale dismantling of public health in the US in favor of
superstition, and masked men kidnapping people from the streets of the US with no due
process _at all_&hellip; it is arguable that we can no longer claim to be civilized.  

We have let right-wing populism turn us into vicious, superstitious, and venomously racist
savages.  And somehow we have done this on a planet-wide basis.  


## Comparison Against Our Casualty Rate Model  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-22-ukraine-1100k-regress-Soldiers-on-DayNum.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-22-ukraine-1100k-regress-Soldiers-on-DayNum-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Initial regression model of soldiers killed on day number, 114 days" title="Initial regression model of soldiers killed on day number, 114 days" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Back in 2023, I started building a regression model tracking number of Russian casualties
versus the number of days from the start of the invasion.  By 2023-May-17, I'd updated the
model a couple of times, and had 114 data points on the first 116 days of the war.  At
that point, I stopped updating in detail, because it was a lot of work to extract the data
from the images posted on X/Twitter by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence.  

The model as of that date is shown here (click to embiggen).  As you can see visually, the
linear fit is pretty good.  The casualty figures snake around a bit, sometimes above and
sometimes below the line.  But the fit is always pretty good, with nice tight confidence
limits.  

The statistics of the fit bear this out, showing an excellent $F$-statistic $p$-value for the overall
fit and good $t$-statistic $p$-values for each coefficient.  The adjusted 
$R^2 \sim 99.43\%$ is surprisingly excellent, i.e., the model was highly predictive.  

```R
Residuals:
    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max 
-3077.9 -1720.8    72.2  1169.4  3299.7 

Coefficients:
             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
(Intercept) 1.225e+05  3.318e+02   369.3   <2e-16 ***
x           6.996e+02  4.984e+00   140.4   <2e-16 ***
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

Residual standard error: 1767 on 112 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.9943,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.9943 
F-statistic: 1.97e+04 on 1 and 112 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
```

The model back then showed a surprisingly steady casualty rate of about 700 Russians/day.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-22-ukraine-1100k-regress-DayNum1100k-on-Soldiers.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-22-ukraine-1100k-regress-DayNum1100k-on-Soldiers-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Current soldiers killed vs day number, compared to initial regression model" title="Current soldiers killed vs day number, compared to initial regression model" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

That was at what turns out to have been just the _beginning_ of this madness.  One thing
leads to another, and here we are having moved on from day 116 to approximately day 1000.  

The plot here (click to embiggen) shows:  
- the original data (blue points, lower left),
- the line fitted to the original data (black line, gray prediction confidence interval),
  and  
- the new points, approximately every 100,000 deaths, plotted in red points.  

The striking feature here is that when I started plotting the new points at about day 450,
the death rate increased relative to the original model.  If you squint diagonally back
along the red points, there's no argument any more for a nonlinear increase, but there is
a _very_ good argument for a linear increase, i.e., a new rate of deaths/day.  We've gone
from about 700 Russian deaths per day to a little over 1000 Russian deaths per day.
That's not a little thing: it's a 43% increase in the Russian death rate!  

If we were to re-fit a model, clearly it should have a breakpoint at 450 days, with
separate linear fits before and after.

We don't know if the Ukrainians have just gotten so much better at war (arguably true,
especially with drones) or if the Russians have resorted to more and more human wave
tactics (also arguably true). Either way, it's more human sacrifice.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Not all of this is the fault of the US or Europe, but we have certainly prolonged the
conflict by being just&hellip; _flighty_ about Ukrainian support.  

On this matter as with so regrettably many others, all of us have much of which to be
ashamed.  

The treatment for shame is [_tikkun olam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam):
repentance and repair of the damage we've all done to the world.  But we certainly don't
seem interested in walking down that path, do we?
