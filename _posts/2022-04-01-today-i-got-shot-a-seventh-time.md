Today I got my 7th vaccination shot in the last 12 months.  Happily.  


## Nous n'avons pas attrapp&eacute; le poisson d'avril!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-04-01-foolishness-poisson.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Attrapons le poisson d'avril?  Mais, non!" title="Attrapons le poisson d'avril?  Mais, non!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Honest, this is not an April Fool's joke.  Not even of the delicious French variety (which
always involve fish, for some reason).  

In the last 12 months, I've gotten 2 shingles vaccine doses, 1 flu vaccine dose, and now
another COVID-19 booster (the 4th COVID-19 vaccination), for a total of 7.  That's a _lot_
of vaccinations. I've really been making my immune system pay its rent, but now I can
stand in the shadow of its protection.  

And that's _A Good Thing._  

Here's the story of the latest COVID-19 vaccine booster, and how I decided to offer up my
personal deltoid to be injected (but not
[inspected or selected](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m57gzA2JCcM), as the anthem of my
generation goes).  


## The Last Couple Days  in COVID-19 News  

Let's start from the original sources, then work our way outward into the secondary media
with their summaries and analyses, and then some of the scientific literature underlying
the decision process.  

### The Primary Sources  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-fda-1.jpg" width="400" height="303" alt="FDA News Release: Approval of 2nd booster for elders &amp; immunocompromised" title="FDA News Release: Approval of 2nd booster for elders &amp; immunocompromised" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-cdc-1.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="CDC Media Statement: Recommends boosters" title="CDC Media Statement: Recommends boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The primary sources, here in the US, are of course the FDA <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
and the CDC <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>.  They approved a second booster (i.e., 4th
dose) of either the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccines for:  
- People age 50 and older, who have received 3 doses, and at least 4 months after the last
  dose,  or  
- People 12 or older with "certain kinds of immunocompromise" and at least 4 months since
  previous dose can get _Pfizer only_, or  
- People 18 or older with the "same certain kinds of immunocompromise" can get another
  dose of _Moderna only_.  
  
Basically, everybody over 50, those over 12 or 18 with immunocompromise, and Pfizer
getting the nod for the 12-18 group.  

That's&hellip; _interestingly specific._ We know that Pfizer applied for a booster for
elders only, whereas Moderna applied for a boost for everybody over 18.  The FDA decided
on this instead, giving Pfizer more leeway with younger patients.  It's _probably_ because
the dose level in Pifzer is lower, and maybe more easily tolerated by smaller bodies?  But
it's sort of the opposite of what the companies applied for.  

It's also _slightly_ surprising and frustrating that this was done without review by the
external committees (VRBPAC at the FDA and ACIP at the CDC).  But only slightly:  
- On the one hand, we all understand the need to move quickly.  Having another layer of
  evaluations when the situation is clear is&hellip; _not_ something we need.  And these vaccines
  are indeed well-understood empirically, i.e., where they work and the side-effects.  So
  maybe external review wasn't strictly necessary.  
- On the other hand &ndash; and I'm just venting my personal frustration here &ndash;
  without the public meetings there's no public release of documents.  We don't get to see
  the submission dossier, the slide decks of the various evaluating bodies, and so on.
  Those were _very_ rich with detail when the vaccines were originally submitted, so I
  kind of miss them here.  It's _possible_ to get _some_ of the data, but only based on
  rumor as to what was used, and it takes a lot of digging.  
  
So&hellip; ok.  The data nerd in me is a little frustrated.  And even I admit that the
public peer review and critique can sometimes resemble a public flogging; it demonstrates
committment for sure, but rather more painfully than necessary.  

We're happy with the end decision to authorize another booster, since there seems to be
relatively little occurrence of "antigenic original sin", and the Omicron-specific
vaccines don't seem to be that much better (so far; we're not done yet, in that regard).
We'll dig a little for data, but right now this all seems more or less ok.  

[Zvi at _Don't Worry About the Vase_](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2022/03/31/they-dont-know-about-second-booster/) is a bit more negative about the usual peer review meetings, as we would expect.  He also quotes [Vincent Racaniello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Racaniello), professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia, on the Israeli data that (apparently) went into the FDA/CDC decision.  After complaining that the boosted and unboosted cohorts were not matched for co-morbidities, Racaniello goes into the numbers:  

>Among participants aged 60 to 69, death from Covid-19 occurred in __5 of
>111,776 participants in the second-booster group and 32 of 123,786
>participants in the rst-booster group__ (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.16;
>95% CI, 0.06 to 0.41; P<0.001) (Table S2).  
>  
> Among participants aged 70 to 79, death from Covid-19 occurred in __22
> of 134,656 participants in the second-booster group and 51 of 74,717
> participants in the rst-booster group__ (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.28;
>95% CI, 0.17 to 0.46; P<0.001) (Table S3).  
>  
>Among participants aged 80 to 100, death from Covid-19 occurred in __65
>of 82,165 participants in the second-booster group and 149 of 36,365

>95% CI, 0.15 to 0.27; P<0.001) (Table S4).  
>  
> Really, 5 vs 32, 22 vs 51, 65 vs 149 and you are making policy for the
> US based on this? This is insanity.  

(__NB:__ "rst-booster" above should apparently be "first-booster".)  

I'm not as negative as Racaniello here, despite his being very much a big cheese and me
being very much a tr&egrave;s p'tit fromage.  However:  

- These effects are all _statistically significant_ by the hazard ratio test
  (as shown by the $p$-values).  So the effect is probably _real_, i.e., it would
  reproduce in another experiment.  
- The _strength of effect_ is large enough to be meaningful as well, reducing the death rates by
  large fold ratios.  
  
  For example, in the first group of 60-69, the fold ratio is:  
  
  $$
  \frac{32/123,786}{5/111,776} = 5.78
  $$

When you get an effect which is both statistically significant and has a good strength
of effect, it's usually _time to pay attention._

Now, if I may interpret Racaniello a bit, he seems to be making the point that this
intervention successfully reduces a risk, but it was a risk that was _already small to
begin with_.  Maybe your time would have been better spent reducing smoking, or treating
obesity, or getting gun safety practices more widespread?  (I've got a list somewhere
here, of the usual liberal interventions.)  

That might be.  But this looks like a pretty low cost &amp; sure thing to me, as a person in
that 60-69 age group, so I'm disposed to take it.  

Zvi continues, observing that he will pass on the 2nd booster:  
> That is also because I am young and healthy, so much so that I am not even currently
> eligible. If I was sufficiently old and/or unhealthy, I would have a lower threshold for
> boosting, but I would still wait until conditions were getting worse to better time the
> benefits.  
>&hellip;  
> 1. Cost of second booster is small.  
> 2. Benefit of second booster is small and temporary.  
> 3. If youâ€™re at very high risk, maybe it makes sense.  
> 4. Either decision is at worst a small mistake.  

Probably skipping is reasonable for Zvi, especially since he's young &amp; ineligible anyway.  

I'm skeptical that one can see a wave coming in advance enough to time a booster.  I'm
even more skeptical that other people won't dogpile on the booster supply, making
appointments impossible to get when the time comes.  So while I'm older but in reasonable
health, I want the sure thing of having the booster _now_ while the Omicron/BA.2 wave comes
along.  I'll take that 5.78-fold reduction in risk of death for my age decile, thank
you very much.  

But I agree with Zvi that, given the low risk level for someone with 3 doses already, it's a
marginal decision.  Even if the decision (2nd boost _vs_ no 2nd boost) turns out wrong, it's
probably a small error either way, given what we know now.  

### The General Media  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-reuters-1.jpg" width="400" height="238" alt="Reuters: US authorizes 2nd booster for elders" title="Reuters: US authorizes 2nd booster for elders" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-globe-1.jpg" width="400" height="193" alt="Globe: US authorizes another booster for elders" title="Globe: US authorizes another booster for elders" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-globe-2.jpg" width="400" height="128" alt="Globe: Some critiques of timing of 2nd boosters" title="Globe: Some critiques of timing of 2nd boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The general  media reported this all over the place; as a representative example here's
the _Reuters_ coverage. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> Alas, they omit or  mangle most of
the details of who's eligible when immunocompromised, what the immunocompromises are,
which vaccines go to which age groups, and so on.  They got the general idea of "2nd
boosters for the over 50 crowd" right, but pretty much stopped there.  That was typical of
most of the general media coverage I read.  

_Reuters_ did point out correctly that given the Republicans blocking any pandemic
spending, the government only has money to cover boosters for elders.  _That_ is something
that will have to be addressed, but it is, alas, not a scientific problem.  

_STAT News_ had some slightly more detailed coverage. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>
(Though, amusingly enough, their hyperlink to "underlying medical conditions" lead to
apple.com.  I mean, yeah, it's an addiction, but not _that_ kind of addiction!)  They noted the lack of
VRBPAC and ACIP meetings will attract critics, and that the final age ranges are kind of
opposite what the companies applied for.  They claimed Moderna applied for a larger age
range to give the FDA "flexibility" in assigning age ranges, which I'd never heard
before (and view skeptically).  

They also correctly, in my view, assess the risk of the oncoming Omicron/BA.2 wave as
being a good reason to boost _now_, though it might leave us more vulnerable come winter.  Kind
of hard to say which way to dodge, here.  

The venerable _Boston Globe_ offers more or less standard coverage.  <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> 

Interestingly, the venerable _Globe_ quotes some different Israeli data (as usual, mangled
so that we don't know the age cohort beyond "over 60", let alone know the source), showing
92/328,000 deaths in the group with 4 doses vs 232/234,000 deaths in the group with 3
doses.  Even just a simple (as in _na&iuml;ve_) statistical test of proportion shows that
this is wildly statistically significant, with a 3.5-fold reduction in death rates:  

```R
> prop.test(x = c(92, 232), n = c(328000, 234000))

	2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction

data:  c(92, 232) out of c(328000, 234000)
X-squared = 118.58, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
95 percent confidence interval:
 -0.0008544266 -0.0005675037
sample estimates:
      prop 1       prop 2 
0.0002804878 0.0009914530 

> 0.0009914530 / 0.0002804878
[1] 3.534746
```

Though, to take a point from Racaniello above, it is a reduction in a death rate that's
already low.  We could do more statistical tests, but the point should be reasonably
clear: the effect is real and large, but you can argue about whether it's worth the
bother given the already-low death risk.  

The venerable _Globe_ also reports on a number of Boston physicians questioning the timing
of boosting, given the unknowns about when another wave might 
arrive. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> Yes, we can't do it perfectly with exact
predictions of the future.  Zvi thinks he _can_ see the wave coming in time to get boosted
(see above), but I'd rather get boosted now while I see Omicron/BA.2 coming.  There's no
way to do this perfectly, so no sense complaining.  


## Ok, So Should I Get Boosted Again, or Not?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-nyt-1.jpg" width="400" height="545" alt="NYT: Should you get another booster?" title="NYT: Should you get another booster?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So given all that, there's no shortage of people wanting advice on whether or not to get
another booster.  Thus there is no shortage of media articles offering said advice.  One such is
from Apoorva Mandavilli in the _New York Times_ <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>:  

- She summarizes the situation, including the woefully low acceptance rate of first
  boosters so far in the US.  
- Then she notes that there's not exactly a scientific consensus on 2nd boosters.  The
  Israeli study on which it's based was posted only last week, and is a preprint, i.e.,
  not yet peer reviewed. <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>  (I also haven't waded
  through it personally yet, though there's no especial reason you should care about
  that.  We'll consult Eric Topol later on this subject, anyway.)  
- The Israeli study is "decisive" in terms of mortality rate, but flawed: all the people
  who got the 4th shot were _volunteers_ (i.e., not randomized), and thus the 3-shot and 4-shot
  cohorts are sort of compromised statistically.  Mandavilli's explanation here was pretty nice.  
- She quotes Robert Wachter of the Department of Medicine at UCSF: 
  > As a healthy 64-year-old man whose third shot was seven months ago, I will get one
  > this week if I can.  

  Sounds good enough for me, as a reasonably healthy mid-60s type.  (But in true both-sider
  fashion, Mandavilli goes on to quote other experts with other opinions.)  
- And, of course, we don't understand quantitatively the effects of prior COVID-19
  disease, or [antigenic original sin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_antigenic_sin).  
  
Next, lets consult [Eric Topol of the Scripps Translational Research Institute](https://drerictopol.com/meet-eric-topol/). He's had a few things to say on Twitter, as well as on his blog [_Ground Truths_](https://erictopol.substack.com/):  

First, there is definitely an Omicron/BA.2 wave coming; the only question is how big:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">

    â€”The good part is that we&#39;re starting from a very low case burden, unlike previous waves<br>

    â€”We will have a wave. The only question is how big it&#39;ll be

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

Second, there's some evidence that mixing the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines as
mutual boosters gives a salubrious result:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

Third, the US is woefully under-boosted.  Compare the US to European countries, and then
think about how the Omicron/BA.2 wave is hitting them _vs_ how it will hit us:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">

## Consulting Experts in Longer Form

Next, let's consult Topol in longer form at his blog
[_Ground Truths_](https://erictopol.substack.com/) <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8), 
and the epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina at her blog,
[_Your Local Epidemiologist_](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/). <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>
They're both _well_ worth your time.  Really.  

### Eric Topol @ Ground Truths  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-ground-truths-1.jpg" width="400" height="133" alt="Topol @ GroundTruths: Boosters actually work" title="Topol @ GroundTruths: Boosters actually work" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Topol's opener summarizes the question on the minds of everybody who's paying attention:  

> The inconvenient truth is that we are going to experience a new BA.2 variant wave in the
> United Statesâ€”the magnitude of which remains uncertainâ€”and, this highlights the question
> of whether a 2nd booster (4th shot) would be useful.  

There _will_ be an Omicron/BA.2 wave.  How bad is uncertain, but we know that boosters
will help.  How much will they help, and should you get one?  

One thing that will help is previous Omicron/BA.1 or Omicron/BA1.1 infection: there should
be at least some cross-immunity.  Since estimates now say almost 40% of Americans got the
first wave of Omicron, they should have _some_ protection against BA.2.  

But the other thing that will help _even better_ is a recent booster.  Topol shows a
summary table from the preprint of a Qatari study <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-ground-truths-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-ground-truths-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="312" alt="Qatari study: vaccine efficacies vs BA.1 and BA.2" title="Qatari study: vaccine efficacies vs BA.1 and BA.2" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Look at the last 4 rows there: 3-shot efficacy vs hospitalization is 70% - 80%.  A recent fourth
shot in a BA.2 wave would be even better.  

In fact, the efficacy of a 2nd booster has been studied already a couple of times, all during the Israeli Omicron wave. <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup> <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup> <sup id="fn15a">[[15]](#fn15)</sup>
They range from a small safety study of health-care workers, to a 1 million+ person study
comparing 3rd vs 4th shots.  Their results are quite strikingly in favor of another
booster.  For example, the Kaplan-Meier curves for 3 shots vs 2 shots (1st booster vs Delta)
and 4 shots vs 3 shots (2nd booster vs Omicron) are pretty similar, showing _almost_ as much of a
boost from the second booster as from the first:  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-ground-truths-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-ground-truths-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="160" alt="Clalit Health: efficacy of first booster vs none and 2nd booster vs 1st" title="Clalit Health: efficacy of first booster vs none and 2nd booster vs 1st" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Now, there are of course several serious issues here, the first couple of which are as
pointed out above by Racaniello to Zvi:  
1. The populations were not especially well matched (though they were _partially_ matched).
   More to the point, those receiving the 4th shot were _volunteers_, not randomized!
   This means the study is convolved with a confounder that will _overstate_ the effect, as
   volunteers are likely more COVID-cautious in the first place.  
2. The base rate is low: we're talking again about a statistically significant and strong
   effect of reduction of death, but for a death rate that was _already small._  It may,
   however, be important at the population level: all those elder deaths eventually add
   up!  
3. The plot on the left was during Delta, while the plot on the right is during Omicron.
   This is likely why the effect is slightly less dramatic for Omicron: 78% reduction in
   hospitalization vs 90% reduction.  Omicron is _nasty._  
   
So those are about the same cautions we teased out above.  

Topol also points out the unpredictability of SARS-CoV2, and how unlikely we are to intuit
the onset of a wave in time to get boosted (emphasis in original):  

> It is noteworthy that several countries like India, Bangladesh, and Sweden transitioned
> to ~100% BA.2 without experiencing a new case increase. _Yes, this virus is as
> unpredictable as it is formidable._  

Topol's summary recommendation is in line with the decision toward which I was already
leaning:  

> I would recommend the 2nd booster if you are more than 4-6 months from your 3rd shot,
> you are age 50+, you tolerated the previous shots well, and you are concerned about the
> BA.2 wave where you live, or that itâ€™s getting legs as you are trying to decide. Or if
> you are traveling or have plans that would put you at increased risk.  

So for me, yeah&hellip; _boost._  Though he does point out that if you've had 3 doses of vaccine
and caught Omicron anyway (really due to just plain bad luck), you can skip the second
booster.  Or not, since the 2nd booster is low cost and low risk.  

### Katelyn Jetelina @ Your Local Epidemiologist  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-yle-1.jpg" width="400" height="130" alt="Jetelina @ Your Local Epidemiologist: Getting a 2nd booster" title="Jetelina @ Your Local Epidemiologist: Getting a 2nd booster" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Jetelina opens by pointing out that fourth doses of mRNA vaccines have been underway not
just in Israel, but also in the UK and Germany.  So this is by no means unusual.  The US
is, as regrettably usual, playing catch-up.  

Oddly, [the FDA VRBPAC committee meeting next week was to debate second boosters](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-hold-advisory-committee-meeting-covid-19-vaccines-discuss-future), but
specifically was told _there would be no votes on any particular application._  Since the
FDA approved those applications this week, we now see why that caveat was there.  Still&hellip;
pretty odd, though.  

Jetelina's main points:  
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-yle-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-yle-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Shen @ Nat Med: 4th dose vs Omicron is like 3rd dose vs Delta" title="Shen @ Nat Med: 4th dose vs Omicron is like 3rd dose vs Delta" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- A paper by Shen in _Nature Medicine_ <sup id="fn16a">[[16]](#fn16)</sup> points out that
  both empirical evidence from Europe
  and quantitative models agree that a 3rd dose against Omicron is about as effective as a
  second dose against Delta.  In other words, Omicron is nastier and another booster seems
  altogether in order.  
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-yle-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-yle-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="238" alt="UK Health Services Agency: hospitalization efficacy good, Moderna maybe slightly better" title="UK Health Services Agency: hospitalization efficacy good, Moderna maybe slightly better" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- The UK Health Services Agency reports <sup id="fn17a">[[17]](#fn17)</sup> that
  hospitalization efficacy vs both Delta and
  Omicron are holding up, better than efficacy vs any infection at all.  But Omicron is
  worse, so again a booster seems in order to cope with Omicron.  
- Moderna holding up a bit better, compared to Pfizer/BioNTech. <sup id="fn18a">[[18]](#fn18)</sup>
  But again, Topol's citation of Kaplonke above indicates combination of vaccines, so I'm 
  inclined on that basis and on this point from Jetelina to get a Moderna booster on top
  of my Pfizer doses.  
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-yle-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-yle-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="174" alt="Jetelina @ YLE on MMWR Data: VE better vs ED encounters and hospitalizations with boosters" title="Jetelina @ YLE on MMWR Data: VE better vs ED encounters and hospitalizations with boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- US vaccine efficacy seems to be declining slightly, as shown in this graph by Jetelina
  from the CDC's MMWR data. <sup id="fn19a">[[19]](#fn19)</sup>  
- Interestingly, ref13 from Regev-Yochay (one of the Israeli studies cited above) notes
  that immunogenicity in younger health care workers maxes out @ 3 doses.  So for younger
  folks there may be no point in 4th dose/2nd booster.  

So Jetelina gives no specific advice, but seems broadly consistent with Topol.  


## Of Course There Will be Problems&hellip;  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-nyt-2.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Leonhardt @ NYT: Two COVID Problems" title="Leonhardt @ NYT: Two COVID Problems" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As long as Republicans can throw a wrench into the works, there will be problems as
documented today by Leonhardt at the _NYT_. <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>
Basically, we face a number of problems here:  
- In the short term, too few people are seeking vaccination.  That includes primary
  vaccination, boosters, and now second boosters.  The graph above shown in Topol's tweet
  shows the US far behind many European countries&hellip; the countries currently being
  trounced by Omicron/BA.2.  How much more badly will the US get trounced, with a lower
  vaccination level overall, and no effective universal health care?  
- In the long term, we haven't bought enough doses of vaccine.  Partly that's because of
  congressional obstinacy, with Republicans wanting to claw back money from the states to
  pay for it.  Given the razor's edge of most state budgets, that is just impossible.  So
  if there's a surge, we'll need more vaccine doses, but we won't have the money to buy
  them and most of them will be bought by other countries anyway.  
  
The sheer _predictability_ of all this is the most tiresome part.  Can't we elect fewer
Republicans and start _doing_ useful things again?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Well, this was a bit of a lengthy trawl through the media and bits of the scientific
literature, wasn't it?  Still, I think it led to a pretty firm conclusion for someone of
my age and COVID caution level.  (Younger, less risk-averse people will of course reach
the opposite conclusion.)  

It looked to me, taking advice from Wachter &amp; Topol's quote of the Kaplonke paper in
_Science_, as a past-mid-60s guy whose last shot was 5 months ago, that I should take the 2nd
booster.  And it should be Moderna, to offset my previous 3 doses of Pfizer.  

A bit of poking around on the day after the FDA approval revealed that nobody was prepared
to provide it yet (sigh).  Poking around the _next_ day revealed that all slots were taken, for
that day and the next (sigh).  (This was starting to remind me of the spring of 2021, with the
vaccine chaos.)  Still, I managed to snag a Moderna appointment on Friday (today).  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-01-today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time-injection.jpg" width="400" height="353" alt="Your humble Weekend Editor getting a 2nd booster (Moderna)" title="Your humble Weekend Editor getting a 2nd booster (Moderna)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

This afternoon I took a short sail in the Weekend Zeppelin for the appointment. (In reality a boring bus ride and train ride.)  I arrived at a local vaccine dispensary for my appointment. Here is your humble Weekend Editor's portside dorsal manipulator tentacle, being injected with a 2nd booster.  Moderna, this time.  (You know, I wish I could ride in a real zeppelin, or [one of the modern airships like the LMH-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_phicOPoQT8).  Parking might be more of a problem than usual, though.  That would _more_ than offset any vaccine reaction discomfort!)  

Tune in tomorrow for an [after-action report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_action_report)
of the side-effects.  Given the higher dose of Moderna, I expect a bit more in the
reactogenicity department here, than with Pfizer/BioNTech.  But&hellip; _happily._  

### Addendun 2022-Apr-02  

Really not bad: kind of sore in my deltoid, a little sore and feverish last night, but
overall not bad.  

I'm&hellip; vaguely disappoinnted.
