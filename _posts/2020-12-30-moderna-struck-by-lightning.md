Explaining to COVID vaccine clinical trial participants that the probability of a certain
[serious adverse event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_adverse_event) 
is 1/50,000 or less doesn't work.  Most people _instantly_ stop listening at the slightest
whiff of mathematics, including ordinary numbers.  But if you compare it to being struck
by lightning, that makes sense to most people.  Can you guess what happened next?  


## What's the sitch?  

If you're going to run a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard of evidence in
medicine, you need to understand 2 things: how serious adverse events (SAEs) are reported,
and informed consent from the people participating.  

### Serious Adverse Event reporting

The reporting of 
[Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_adverse_event)
is maybe a lot more careful &amp; thorough than you probably think!  

Basically, you report _everything_, whether plausibly related to the treatment or not.
You even report what happens to people in the placebo arm of the trial, for comparison.
If somebody gets run over by a truck, you report it.  (Could the treatment have made them
absent-minded, and they walked out into traffic? <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>)
If somebody dies in a plane crash, you report it.  If somebody&hellip; well, _you report
it_.  Statisticians will sort it out later.  

### Informed consent of participants  

The other thing is that the participants have to understand what the risks are, how likely
they are, and similarly for the benefits.  This involves getting a tiny bit of probability
into the heads of the general public, which is no easy task.  

Generally speaking, if you try to use math, you will fail.  Even if you avoid math, and
just use numbers &ndash; not even arithmetic, just quote a few numbers &ndash; most people
will resist.  Numbers slide off them like water off the back of a duck.  They think it's
"some nerd thing" that is of no concern to "real people" such as themselves.  It's just plain
mathematical illiteracy, which is an educational scandal, but&hellip; nothing we can fix
at this point.  

So people use analogies to explain the risks.  The chance of, say, a heart attack in the
trial is estimated (very crudely) as being about like getting struck by lightning (which
[the Centers for Disease Control estimate at about 1/500,000 per person per year](https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/lightning/victimdata.html)).
Most people can sort of wrap their brains around that.  

__Now_ can you predict where this is going?  


## 3 SAEs in the treatment arm of the Moderna trial  

Ok, you're gonna make me spell it out, aren't you?  

If you dig a bit deeper into the FDA analysis of
the Moderna data submitted for the EUA <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
(as we did [previously]({{ site.baseurl }}/beautiful-vaccines-2/), but apparently not
deeply enough!), there is of course a report of exactly the 3 SAEs in the treatment arm of
the trial, on page 54:

> As of December 6, 2020, there were 3 SAEs reported in the vaccine group: a 65-year-old participant with community acquired pneumonia 25 days after vaccination, __a 72-year-old participant with arrhythmia after being struck by lightning 28 days after vaccination,__ and an 87- year-old participant with worsening of chronic bradycardia 45 days after vaccination. On FDA review of the narratives, none of these SAEs are assessed as related. There were no cases of severe COVID-19 reported in the study.  

We first note approvingly the final sentence, that the FDA statisticians decided none of
these were related to the treatment, which is the good news.  Also, all the SAEs were in
elderly participants, who are at higher risk for SAEs anyway, treatment or no.  This is
why you report _everything_, so nobody can accuse you of covering anything up, and the
statisticians can absolve you of blame.  

But&hellip; _one of the participants was struck by lightning!_

Now, you know what happens next here.  The more mathematically illiterate media will of course
report this endlessly, sometimes with a wink &amp; a nod to indicate they know better, but
nonetheless baiting the less mathematically literate readers to mistake it for actual news.
This particular example <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> is from the 
[Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(British_newspaper)), 
a British tabloid for which I didn't have much respect at the outset.  And now I have even
less respect for them, since the headline "Covid vaccine volunteer, 72, struck by
lightning after getting Moderna injection" _invites_ people to draw the most stupid
conclusion possible, that the Moderna vaccine attracts lightning strikes.  

Must be the ground strap for that microchip Bill Gates is putting in all of us via the
vaccines, right?. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>

<a id="fn1">1</a>: Back before the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare, I saw this used to deny
coverage based on pre-existing conditions.  Suppose you were diabetic, and because you didn't
work for a large company, you had to accept insurance that excluded your pre-existing
diabetes.  

Now you get hit by a truck and break your leg.  Are you covered?  

Maybe not: insurers could have argued your diabetes made you hypoglycemic, so you spaced
out &amp; walked into traffic, and thus they don't have to pay.  

This is the sort of evil behavior that the ACA tried to stamp out, with mixed results and
hysterical resistance from Republicans. [↩](#fn1a)
