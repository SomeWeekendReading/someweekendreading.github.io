[Mild Content Warning: this is a long, dark, angry post.  But it's grounded in unfortunate
facts of a dark, angry time.  "Long" is just my own fault.] Periodically,
[somebody asks me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about current news in
vaccines.  I find it really hard now to write about that subject, for reasons that should
be obvious. Perhaps this post is less _analysis,_ and more _catharsis?_  


## The Scent of Burning Libraries

A British friend &ndash; alas, I've forgotten whom, exactly, so if it happened to be
you, please tell me so I can credit you with the witticism &ndash;
compared the US now to how they felt in the UK during Brexit:  

> It's as though your library was burned down by out-of-town mobs who can't or won't read&hellip;
> and don't think you should either.  

That's how the US feels right now, at least to this aging scientist.  

Perhaps like an old Roman scholar helplessly living through the invasion of the Germanic
barbarians sacking Rome.  Or an old Alexandrine scholar, lamenting the loss of the Library of
Alexandria.  (Yes, I know the Library's disappearance was complicated and not just one
maniac burning it down. We, though, face one maniac burning down civilization in the US.)  

This topic is hard enough for me that I want to get it all out at once, and not suffer
through writing like this over and over, at least for a while.  So buckle up: we're going
through 33 sources, mostly scientific papers, today.  


## The Reality of The Vaccines  

In some ways, the tragedy of our superstitious citizens' rejection of vaccines is that
they are rejecting what is arguably one of the best medical discoveries in the history of
humanity.  The data is not hard to find.  

1. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-lancet-1.jpg" width="400" height="302" alt="Shattock, et al. @ The Lancet: 50 years, 154 million live saved, 9 billion life years lived" title="Shattock, et al. @ The Lancet: 50 years, 154 million live saved, 9 billion life years lived" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-lancet-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-lancet-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="305" alt="Shattock, et al. @ The Lancet: 50 years, 154 million live saved, 9 billion life years lived" title="Shattock, et al. @ The Lancet: 50 years, 154 million live saved, 9 billion life years lived" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   For example, I quickly found an article by Shattock, _et al._ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
   in _The Lancet_ (an absolutely _first-rate_ medical journal).  They report quantitatively on the
   improvements wrought by vaccines over the last 50 years, so we're looking back about 2
   generations here:
   - The leftmost graph shows the cumulative lives saved over the last 50 years.  It adds up
     to 154 million people worldwide who could "live, and not die" as it says in an old
     book.  Most of those are the yellow bars, which represents measles.  
     - __NB:__ measles has an $R_0 \sim 12-18$, meaning 1 sick person infects 12-18
     unvaccinated others.  Also, it hangs in the air for _hours._  Measles is the 
     _most contagious disease known to humanity,_ and suppressing that is a big deal!  
   - The middle graph shows the number of life years those people got to live, instead of
     dying.  It adds up to 9 billion years of human life that would otherwise have been
     snuffed out!  
   - Finally, the right-hand graph shows years of full health, i.e., the vaccines have allowed
     people to live billions of years of full health, not at all compromised by being
     vaccinated.  

   If &ndash; as Bertrand Russel didn't _quite_ say &ndash; the mark of a civilized person is
   to be able to look at a column of numbers and weep, then a civilized person must look at
   these graphs and smile in gratitude for the blessing we have been granted with vaccines!

   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-owid-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-owid-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="280" alt="Dattani &amp; Spooner @ Our World in Data: bar chart of Shattock data on global number of lives saved by childhood vaccines" title="Dattani &amp; Spooner @ Our World in Data: bar chart of Shattock data on global number of lives saved by childhood vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   This point is rammed home quite dramatically with a graphic from the _Wall St Journal_,
   shown here <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> (along with others for hepatitis A, mumps,
   pertussis (whooping cough), polio, rubella, and smallpox at the link).  
   - The vertical axis represents US states, while the horizontal axis represents time.  
   - The color code of each box tells you the number of measles cases, with light blue
     representing zero.  
   - Note the _dramatic_ drop-off of measles cases shortly after 1963, when the vaccines
     became available!  

   Similarly, Dattani &amp; Spooner at _Our World in Data_ (lots of fun, btw!) looked through
   the data from the Shattock paper, and came up with this dramatic presentation of the
   number of children's lives saved. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  Once again measles,
   being the most contagious disease ever, is the one where vaccines saved the most lives.  

   Just sit with that number for a moment: more than 93 million children saved.  This is an
   occasion for pride and gratitude, absolutely _not_ for suspicion of vaccines!  

This is _reality:_  vaccines are _good._  


## The Superstitious Reaction _to_ Vaccines  

The deep sadness of our particular moment in history is that we, almost exclusively among
conservatives in the US, react with superstition instead of reality.  

1. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-gallup-1.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="Jones @ Gallup: Childhood vaccination importance falls among Republicans" title="Jones @ Gallup: Childhood vaccination importance falls among Republicans" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-gallup-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-gallup-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="236" alt="Jones @ Gallup: Republicans start to think childhood vaccines less important" title="Jones @ Gallup: Republicans start to think childhood vaccines less important" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-gallup-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-gallup-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="314" alt="Jones @ Gallup: Republicans start to think disease is less risky than vaccination" title="Jones @ Gallup: Republicans start to think disease is less risky than vaccination" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   Consider this analysis of a Gallup poll by Jones.  <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>
   - The first graph show the fraction of people who value childhood vaccinations, over
     time.  It's stratified by political orientation.  
     - The first alarming bit is that it was never over 65%!  Despite the millions of lives
       saved, _billions_ of life-years restored, people just&hellip; won't listen.  
     - Republicans were always a bit behind in the whole civilization-building enterprise,
       but not by very much until 2020.  
     - But once the pandemic started, they marinated in such a toxic stew of disinformation
       that things changed; apparently Trump normalized lying.  Almost half the Republicans
       who previously valued childhood vaccinations decided they were unimportant (50% down
       to 25%).  Almost half!  
   - Even more disturbingly, the second graph shows a sudden, steep increase, in Republicans
     _only,_ who believe disease is less risk than vaccination for their children.
     Apparently they fell that polio, measles, and COVID-19 are less of a big deal
     because&hellip; they only kill and maim children, whereas vaccines are a Democrat
     pollution of their essence, or something?  (I find it hard to understand why this is not
     just child abuse!)  

2. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-topol-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-topol-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="123" alt="Topol on Wash State Dept of Health data: cumulative death curves for Republicans continue to diverge" title="Topol on Wash State Dept of Health data: cumulative death curves for Republicans continue to diverge" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   The estimable
   [Eric Topol on Mastodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@erictopol@mstdn.social/112083201742283852)
   confirms this, with some data shown here from Washington State:  
   - The leftmost graph shows demonstrably higher death rates among the unvaccinated.  
   - The middle graph, acknowledging Republicans are more likely to be unvaccinated, have
     been dying for years at higher rates in consequence of that.  
   - The right graph of cumulative death rates, continues to diverge: Republicans are killing
     themselves for their vaccine superstitions.  

   Beliefs leading to increased deaths over a period of years are seldom the correct
   beliefs.  There is no virtue in dying for the stupidity of your tribe.  

   Alas, the stupidity of the Republican tribe knows no (upper) bounds.  

3. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-mn-1.jpg" width="400" height="248" alt="Bornhoft @ MN Patch: MN bill to criminalize mRNA vaccines as weapons of mass destruction" title="Bornhoft @ MN Patch: MN bill to criminalize mRNA vaccines as weapons of mass destruction" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   We've previously written, here on the Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), about
   times when:  
   - [Idaho Republicans attempted to criminalize mRNA vaccines](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/covid-disgrace/#idaho-legislators-propose-to-criminalize-mrna-vaccines), and 
   - one particularly bizarre move in which [Florida Republicans resolved to ban COVID-19 vaccines as weapons of mass destruction](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/covid-disgrace/#florida-republicans-pass-resolution-to-ban-covid-19-vaccines).  

   Apparently they're not done with that: a Minnesota bill would also ban mRNA injections of
   any sort as weapons of mass destruction! <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  We checked, and
   there is &ndash; unfortunately &ndash; an actual bill,
   [HF3291/4991, designating mRNA injections and products as weapons of mass destruction](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/text.php?number=HF3219&type=bill&version=0&session=ls94&session_year=2025&session_number=0).  It appears some of the language in the bill is the same as the Florida one, due to the
   involvement in both of the Florida-based hypnotist, Joseph Sansone, previously featured in
   this CLBTNR.  

   Possibly it has little chance of passage.  So one may hope.

   This is more or less confirmed by an article in _STAT News_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, a
   very good source for biopharma and medical news.  Therapeutics involving mRNA are now
   under more or less continual attack from RFK Jr, who has the usual right-wing delusions
   about them.  They have apparently canceled about \$700 million in grants to Moderna for future
   flu vaccines that can be quickly adapted to new strains or even directly attacking
   emerging threats like H5N1.  

   Why have they done this?  Wrong question: there is no "why" when the cause is deeply stupid
   barbarism.

   Jake Scott is a clinical professor of infectious diseases at Stanford.  As such, he knows
   a thing or two about public health, vaccines, clinical studies, and infectious diseases.
   He wrote an article for _The Conversation_ <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> about the many
   gross misinterpretations and outright lies RFKJr is making in order to advance craziness:  
   - 2025-Jun-12 RFKJr told Fox news "97% of federal vaccine advisors are on the take".  This
     is blatantly false, and probably defamatory.  There are elaborate conflict of interest
     disclosures, showing each person's involvement with industry and financial interest.  I
     personally looked at them carefully in the pandemic, and verified that none were
     significant.  As Scott puts it:  
     > [an internal audit] &hellip; found no pervasive wrongdoing – 97% of disclosure forms
     > only contained routine  paperwork mistakes, such as information in the wrong box or a
     > missing initial, and not hidden financial ties.  
   - RFKJr also claimed children had to receive 92 immunization shots.
     - In 1986, children got 11 doses against 7 diseases.  
     - Today, they get 50 doses against 16 diseases.  
     - Schools typically mandate 30-32 doses against 10-12 diseases; nobody requires COVID-19
       vaccinations in children.  
   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-08-beautiful-vaccines-case-rates.jpg" width="400" height="265" alt="Pfizer/BioNTech: case rates in treatment &amp; control arms" title="Pfizer/BioNTech: case rates in treatment &amp; control arms" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
   - He claimed COVID-19 vaccines were not tested against placebos.  Utterly, completely,
     wildly, and dangerously false.  I wonder what he thinks the red curve here is, taken
     from the Pfizer vaccine submission showing infection rates in placebo (red) vs
     vaccinated (blue)?  These graphs are _famous!_  Is he really that ignorant, or just
     lying?  
   - He claims "nobody has any idea how safe" vaccines are, despite elaborate safety
     monitoring during clinical trials and pharmacovigilance/Phase IV monitoring after
     approval.  Staggeringly ignorant!  

   &hellip; and it goes on from there.  

   Kennedy is not just unqualified, but the _opposite_ of qualified: maliciously incompetent.  

6. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-ap-1.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="Lajka @ AP: A lot of this was debunked BACK IN 2021!" title="Lajka @ AP: A lot of this was debunked BACK IN 2021!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   This sort of ignorant rumor-mongering about vaccine deaths has been going on for a long
   time.  For example, here's an AP report from 2021 claiming the Pfizer vaccine trial didn't have
   _any_ efficacy at all, since 14 placebo subjects died and 15 vaccine subjects
   died. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  This is utter nonsense:  
   - First, this is a group of more than 43,000 people.  During the 6 months or so of the
     trial, some number of them are going to die, no matter what.  Every single death is
     investigated, no matter the cause, even if somebody is struck by lightning (which 
     [actually happened in the Moderna trial]({{ site.baseurl }}/moderna-struck-by-lightning/)).
     _None_ of the deaths in either arm were found related to either placebo, or treatment,
     or COVID-19 (except 2 placebo cases and 1 vaccine case).  
   - Second, infection is much more frequent than death.  The trials were about _infection_
     rates.  If you wanted to study death rates, you'd need a much bigger trial, maybe 10x
     larger?  In that case, you'd have to enroll about 430,000 people, which is impossible.  

   The AP article quotes David Cennimo, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers:  
   > “To exaggerate the example for learning, the Pfizer vaccine doesn’t protect you from
   > lightning strikes so equal numbers of people in the vaccine and the placebo control
   > group should get hit by lightning,” Cennimo said.  

   The claim of "no protection" is just stupid.  

7. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-npr-1.jpg" width="400" height="245" alt="Emanuel @ NPR: RFK Jr picked flawed study to discontinue GAVI" title="Emanuel @ NPR: RFK Jr picked flawed study to discontinue GAVI" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   Kennedy decided to cut off \$1 billion of US funds to GAVI, the global vaccine alliance
   which has vaccinated more than half the children in low-income countries.  He did so based
   on a flawed study from 2017, as reported by NPR.  <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>  

   It looked at diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis (DTP) vaccination in west Africa.  This vaccine
   has saved an estimated 40 million lives globally.  But this study mysteriously claimed
   that kids who got the DTP vaccine died more often (though of other things than DTP
   diseases) between 3 months and 6 months of age.  

   But&hellip;  
   1. The __data is really old,__ in fact from the 1980s, so more than 40 years ago.  Vaccination
      rates in Guinea-Bissau, where the study was done, were quite low then, and the risk of
      deaths from all causes was quite high for all infants.  
   2. Two of the authors studied Guinea-Bissau again using data from 2010 and 2014, and saw
      __"no effects on all-cause mortality"__ for DTP-vaxed kids.  This makes it smell like an
      artifact of the very, very old dataset that has little to do with modern reality.   
   3. The __data in the study had lots of gaps and unexamined biases,__ and the analysis
      methods were problematic.  For example, instead of a randomized trial, they looked at
      clinical data.  Parents of sickly kids might seek out vaccination, but those sickly kids might also be at
      increased risk.  There's a _reason_ accrual procedures for clinical trials are what
      they are, to eliminate biases like that.  
   4. __Modern vaccines are very different__ from 40 years ago.  The amount of antigens used is
      much smaller, thanks to adjuvants that make the smaller amounts more effective.  Also,
      the modern version is pentavalent: diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and
      Haemophilus influenza B.  
   5. People screen _relentlessly_ for this sort of thing.  It's called "pharmacovigilance"
      and formally a Phase IV clinical trial, in which you look for bad effects after
      approval in the broadest populations.  __Given that nobody could see it for 40 years,
      which is more likely: that we all just screwed up for 40 years straight, or that
      there's no effect?__  

   So Kennedy has pulled funding for child vaccinations in the developing world based on data
   that's very old, collected under conditions that admit serious biases, analyzed with
   obscure methods, on a vaccine that isn't relevant for at least the last 30 years, and
   which presupposes we're all compliant fools.  

   NPR quotes Atul Gawande, for whom I have great respect:  
   > "Of all the global health programs that have been cut, this will likely mean more deaths
   > than any [other cut]," said Dr. Atul Gawande, who oversaw global health work for the
   > U.S. Agency for International Development under President Biden, in an email to NPR.  

   [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) required child
   sacrifice for political and military ends, too.

   People go off half-cocked (or quarter-cocked?) on all sorts of other ingredients in
   vaccines.  There's a persistent but ridiculous rumor among the hyper-religious that
   vaccines contain cells from aborted babies, for example.  Nothing of the sort is true.  

   Two of the other persistent ones are dangers alleged from the aluminum salts used to make
   the immune system react stronger to less antigen <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> and 
   thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in minute amounts in multi-dose
   vials. <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>  

   These have both been studied _relentlessly,_ finding no dangers:  
   - Kennedy claims &ndash; utterly falsely &ndash; that the aluminum salts used are
     "extremely neurotoxic" and "give[s] you allergies".  
     - On the other hand, _actual_ scientists studied 1.2 million Danish children, calculated
       their aluminum exposures, and found __no statistically significant association to any of
       over 50 chronic conditions._  This study is published in _Annals of Internal Medicine_
       (citation at the footnote, below).  
     - Kennedy, though, fired all the members of the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization
       Practice (ACIP) and appointed wildly unqualified replacements.  He wants them to
       investigate aluminum adjuvants in vaccines, against all scientific evidence.  
   - Thimerosal as a preservative has been a howling point for right-wing vaccine conspiracy
     theorists for years.  
     - Originally, Andrew Wakefield claimed it caused autism in children in a fraudulent
       study in 1998.  It took decades to expose his data fraud and the way he's monetized
       his scare tactics.  His papers were forcibly retracted and he lost his medical license
       for the fraud aspect and for endangering children.  Still&hellip; the right wing never
       learns!   
     - Now Kennedy's ACIP, stacked with the uninformed, wants to remove thimerosal.  It's
       already removed from most vaccines anyway, and is now used only in multi-dose vials
       (e.g., only about 4% of US doses of flu vaccines are in multi-dose
       vials). Manufacturers can easily move to single-dose vials, but at an increase in cost
       and a strain on healthcare deliverer's storage capacity.  Because&hellip; right-wing
       superstition is more important than fact.  

9. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-arstech-2.jpg" width="400" height="183" alt="Mole @ Ars Technica: RFKJr ditches flu shots based on junk data" title="Mole @ Ars Technica: RFKJr ditches flu shots based on junk data" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   Oh, but they've gone further, pulling recommendations for flu shots under some
   circumstances <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>:

   In fact, they listened _only_ to an anti-vax activist, and, in the words of the article
   here, "censored CDC scientists" who objected.  They had prepared a briefing showing all
   the evidence that thimerosal is safe, but were quashed.  They even removed those
   presentations from the web, so nobody could see them.  

   They even got the chemistry wrong: thimerosal is _not_ metabolized into methyl mercury,
   but instead into ethyl mercury and thiosalicylate.  These are very, very different
   things&hellip; but that does not matter to conspiracy theorists indifferent to fact.

   Sure, let's burn it _all_ down, right?  Let _all_ our kids get the "benefit" of measles, the
   most contagious disease known to humanity.  Idiots.

    Kennedy has apparently wholesale fired the FDA's VRBPAC (Vaccine and Related Biological
    Products Advisory Committee).  Now he's fired the CDC's ACIP (Advisory Committee on
    Immunization Practices) and replaced them with what appears to be a raft of clowns.

    I dunno quite what to tell you about them.  They all look really, really bad to me.
    For example, one panelist asked CDC scientists whether a "pattern of broad-based energy of
    some type" may be responsible for a surge in flu deaths this year (see reference 16).
    Yeah, it's all those negative vibes, man.  Pure woo!  

    But you don't have to take the word of some cranky old retired scientist/internet rando.
    Instead, consider the opinion of [epidemiology professor Elizabeth Jacobs](https://bsky.app/profile/elizabethjacobs.bsky.social),
    who summarized it all.  Here's short summary table helpfully
    [summarized on Mastodon by AkaSci](https://fosstodon.org/@AkaSci/114670176282628534).
    They're all&hellip; uniquely awful.  Not just unqualified, but anti-qualified.  

    NB: Retsef Levi, in particular, believes mRNA vaccines have killed more people than they
    have saved.  I don't want dive into his statements to figure out why he thinks that.  It is
    in apparent ignorance of the pharmacovigilance function of Phase IV, which detect 
    _exactly that sort of thing._  

    For example, the COX2 inhibitor Vioxx/rofecoxib was initially hailed as a way to relieve
    arthritis pain without the gastric ulcer complications of COX1/2 inhibitors like aspirin.

    During the clinical trial, way fewer ulcers and _slightly_ more heart attacks were
    observed in the COX2 arm than in the control arm with aspirin.  That makes sense, since
    aspirin is cardio-protective.  This was enough for approval.  

    But, some time later, via pharmacovigilance/Phase IV, it was discovered that there were
    _slightly_ more heart attacks with rofecoxib than could be explained just from not having
    aspirin.  Vioxx/rofecoxib was immediately removed from the market.  

    Compare billions of mRNA vaccines to the number of patients taking COX2 inhibitors like
    Vioxx/rofecoxib.  What's more believable: that there is no increase in all-cause mortality
    from COVID-19 vaccination, or that we are all incompetent fools not to have found it when
    we found smaller effects with COX2 inhibitors?  

    Jacobs suggests that Americans take the following very sensible actions:  
    <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/elizabethjacobs.bsky.social/post/3lrelmzaads2k"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-jacobs-recc.jpg" width="550" height="381" alt="Jacobs recommendations: get every vax you need, buy high-quality masks, because the fools are going to cause reemergence of preventable diseases" title="Jacobs recommendations: get every vax you need, buy high-quality masks, because the fools are going to cause reemergence of preventable diseases" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

    Here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, we've done that.  We got our COVID-19 boosters last fall
    and this spring.  Last fall we got our flu shots.
    [This spring we got MMR boosters, since the knuckleheads have let measles loose again.](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/vax-vs-knuckleheads/)
    At my last physical, a couple weeks ago, I asked my doc to make sure there were no
    vaccinations I needed, and she said I was good to go: COVID-19, flu, RSV, measles, mumps,
    rubella, shingles, and pneumonia are all covered.  

    The state of our medical establishment is pretty bad, particularly around vaccines.  The
    state of our scientific establishment is just as bad, with many scientists essentially
    becoming professional refugees in Europe and Japan.  

    I _wish_ it were limited to that.  

11. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-lt-1.jpg" width="400" height="165" alt="Mack @ Latin Times: Texas tried to refuse criminal treasonous communist government flood money; redirected it to sheriffs" title="Mack @ Latin Times: Texas tried to refuse criminal treasonous communist government flood money; redirected it to sheriffs" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
    But the suspicion and anti-intellectual superstition runs deep.  For example, it appears the recent
    lethal flooding in Texas happened _despite_ the Biden administration's offer of money for
    flood prevention, warning, and mitigation. <sup id="fn17a">[[17]](#fn17)</sup>  
    - They at first turned down the money in 2021, because:
      > &hellip; local officials and residents arguing they didn't want to be "bought" by the Biden
      > administration.  
    - In 2022, they dialed up the rhetoric even more, basically spitting at the federal
      government:  
      > At an April 2022 meeting, one citizen called the White House a "criminal treasonous
      > communist government," urging the county to reject the money altogether. Others echoed
      > that sentiment, saying they didn't want the federal government's help.  
    - The real kicker: they eventually took the approximately \\$10 million,
      _but allocated about \\$8 million to their sheriffs._  Because&hellip; apparently more
      cops make everything better? __For the flood alert system, they spent no money at all.__  

    In consequence of this, more than 100 people lie dead. The rot runs deep: not even
    death deters them.   

These are not the truth-seeking behaviors of scientists; these are the mathematically
illiterate behaviors of superstitious _children._  


## Losing Our Grip: A Golden Age That Could Have Been  

Things are bad, but the most ironic part of all is that they _could_ have been wonderful!
We were on the verge of a golden age of medicine with mRNA therapeutics, there's a green
energy revolution everywhere but the US, and so on.  

Here are a few examples of what could have gone right (or still could if we could neuter MAGA).  

1. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-arstech-3.jpg" width="400" height="173" alt="Mole @ Ars Technica: Moderna mRNA flu vax works well, but under RFKJr future is murky" title="Mole @ Ars Technica: Moderna mRNA flu vax works well, but under RFKJr future is murky" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   Moderna had a clinical trial of an mRNA-based flu vaccine, in comparison with existing flu
   vaccines; it read out recently.  <sup id="fn18a">[[18]](#fn18)</sup>  
   - mRNA-1010 was in one arm of the trial, and conventional flu vaccines in the other.  
   - Nearly 41,000 participants aged 50+ participated.  They were randomized to either
     treatment, and followed for 6 months in last year's flu season.  
   - The 2024-2025 flu season was pretty severe, with an estimated 770,000 hospitalizations
     nationwide.  So this was a severe test of both vaccines.  
   - mRNA-1010 had an efficacy 26.6% higher overall, and 27.4% higher in age 65+.  That is,
     it works _even better_ on an older population.  

   So it's a no-brainer for approval, right?  Good news of a better, cheaper, more flexible
   flu vaccine?  

   Sadly, no.  Kennedy has decreed that all new vaccines must go through _placebo-controlled_
   trials.  That is, those in the control arm _cannot_ get standard of care, i.e., the
   current vaccine as was done in this trial; they must get _nothing._ Now, attend closely:
   this is medically unethical, to deny patients existing treatments in a clinical trial.  No
   IRB (Institutional Review Board) in the whole country would allow such a trial.  

   So Kennedy is demanding another clinical trial: an _unethical_ clinical trial which will
   _risk patient lives_ and _cannot be done._  Perhaps that's a back-door way to just denying
   approval?  

   Nobody knows what's going to happen.  Nobody likes it, either.  At least, nobody
   sensible.

   Moderna also reported on the clinical trial of mRNA-1083, their combined flu/COVID-19
   vaccination.  <sup id="fn19a">[[19]](#fn19)</sup> This is a good idea, because you can get
   much better patient compliance when you tell people to get 1 shot instead of 2.  This is
   much like other combo vaccines, e.g., MMR (measles/mumps/rubella) or DTaP
   (diphtheria/tetanus/pertussis).  Let's look at the results, including the _JAMA_ publication:  
   - The study saw the same or _better_ immune response compared with doing separate shots.  
   - There were 8015 participants, 4017 of whom were aged over 65 years, and with a good mix
     of men &amp; woman as well as Black or Latino.  
   - Noninferior immunogenicity was found, compared to the separate shots by a couple of
     statistical measures.  (Did I just _skip statistical details?!_)  
   - There were some adverse reactions (Grade 1 or 2, i.e., "no big deal" or "mildly
     annoying").  These were all solicited, i.e., physicians specifically asked about every
     headache, ever bit of tiredness, and so on.  This is a very good result.  

   But&hellip; the political situation is of course terrible.  Kennedy would demand _another_
   clinical trial against a placebo, i.e., unethically forcing people to go without either
   vaccine in the control arm.  

   Alas, that Republican political mischief was the poison pill; Moderna withdrew the
   application for approval <sup id="fn20a">[[20]](#fn20)</sup> just 10 days later, despite
   the success of the clinical trial.  I've never seen _that_ happen before; the environment
   under Kennedy must be truly poisonous for them to throw away this much of an investment.  

   Perhaps Moderna will apply internationally, and the US will fall even further behind.  At
   least _some_ lives will be saved, though not here.

   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-nature-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-nature-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Sethna, et al. @ Nature: Dramatically significant RFS KM curves for PDAC vaccine" title="Sethna, et al. @ Nature: Dramatically significant RFS KM curves for PDAC vaccine" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   That's not the only potential good news for mRNA vaccines.  

   Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and other centers have an mRNA
   vaccine to be given to patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
   (PDAC). <sup id="fn21a">[[21]](#fn21)</sup>  PDAC isn't the absolute worst (that's
   pancreatic adenocarcinoma), but it's still pretty nasty and anything that can help here is
   worthwhile.

   Consider the 2 [Kaplan-Meier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator)
   curves shown here, from Figure 1a of the paper.  They
   basically show the fraction of patients surviving versus time, for the vaccinated (red)
   and unvaccinated (blue) patients.  (The unvaccinated patients, of course, got
   standard-of-care treatment, which is the comparator in these sorts of trials.  _Not_
   placebo!)  

   There's plenty of nuance to discuss here, and as an aging statistical nerd I'm straining
   mightily to keep from going on and on about it.  But the main point is: the blue curve
   drops precipitously, but the red curve does not.  
   - That is, the vaccinated patients tended to have a longer recurrence-free survival (RFS)
     than the others &ndash; basically they lived for 4 more years at the end of the study!
   - They reported a hazard ratio of $\mbox{HR} \sim 0.14$, with a confidence interval of
     0.03 - 0.59; we want to see that bounded away from 1 which is what we have here.  
   - Also, a log-rank 2-tailed test got $p \lt 0.007$, which amply passes all reasonable
     tests of statistical significance.  

   The effect is very _real_, i.e., likely to reproduce, because of statistical
   significance.  The effect size is very _large_, in that it's giving people at least 4 more
   years of life before follow-up stopped.  

   __Bottom Line:__ If you get PDAC, _you want this vaccine!_  

   But&hellip; given that our vaccine approval process is now in the hands of mathematically
   illiterate children with a superstitious fear of mRNA vaccines&hellip; it'll probably be
   delayed until the post-Trump era, in my (pessimistic) opinion.  

4. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-freethink-1.jpg" width="400" height="218" alt="Houser @ Freethink: Moderna melanoma vaccine works well (2023)" title="Houser @ Freethink: Moderna melanoma vaccine works well (2023)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   The good news keeps coming: Moderna reported a Phase IIb result in melanoma, a
   particularly deadly skin cancer (and a common one, with a high risk of
   recurrence).  <sup id="fn22a">[[22]](#fn22)</sup>  

   This is a combination trial:  
   - The control arm patients get &ndash; of course! &ndash; standard of care.  In this case
     it was Keytruda/pembrolizumab.  That's a PD-1 blocker, which blocks the efforts of
     cancer cells to hide from the immune system.  Very good drug!  
   - The treatment arm patients get _combination therapy_ of Keytruda plus Moderna's mRNA
     drug mRNA-4157.  The latter is a weird beast: up to 34 neoantigens unique to a given
     patient's tumor (personalized for _each patient_).  You body will make abnormal proteins
     from those, your immune system will clean them up and learn to hate them, and then your
     immune system will go after cancer cells with those proteins on their surfaces.  

   The combination is eminently sensible: mRNA-4157 primes the immune system to kill cells
   expressing the antigens of your particular cancer, and pembrolizumab "de-cloaks" the
   cancer cells so the immune system can now see them.  

   __Result:__ Combination patients are 49% less likely to die or get a recurrence within 3
   years, compared to Keytruda alone.  They are 62% less likely to get a distant metastasis
   or death.  

   Statistical significance was just around $p \sim 5.3\%$, but you'd expect that in a very
   small Phase IIb trial.  A large Phase III trial is where that'll get settled.  

   Phase III launched in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, but they will take several
   years.  Possibly that's good, since it might come up in the post-Trump era, presuming we
   survive at all.  Other countries might be more sensible, recognizing this good result
   immediately:  

   > “We think that in some countries the product could be launched under accelerated
   > approval by 2025,” Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel told AFP.  

   Would that it were so.  

5. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-stm-1.jpg" width="400" height="164" alt="DE Bloom, et al. @ Sci Transl Med: Vaccination for healthy aging" title="DE Bloom, et al. @ Sci Transl Med: Vaccination for healthy aging" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   Look, I'm an aging, neurodivergent nerd.  If there's something that can help me age more
   gracefully, I want it.  

   (Ironic example: I technically now fit the diagnostic criteria for the GLP-1 drugs, that
   cause such dramatic weight loss.  However, Medicare &ndash; even with my gold-plated
   supplements &ndash; won't cover it.  The cost would be about \\$1500/month, which is
   completely out of reach.  This is what a broken medical system does: it makes good
   therapies unavailable until people either die or are "sick enough.")  

   Bloom, _et al._ <sup id="fn23a">[[23]](#fn23)</sup> don't really have a specific therapy
   in mind, but they discuss rather sensibly all the problems involved.  

   For example, we elders suffer from some immunosenescence, which means vaccines have to be
   stronger to get a good response in us.  I took the high-dose flu vaccine last fall for
   this reason. (Yes, it's too strong for you youngsters.  Maybe when you grow up.)  

   But there's also a climate of vaccine hesitancy and poisonous disinformation.  This is not
   _just_ a political problem, it's _deadly_ to people like me who are depending on good
   vaccines against infectious diseases and cancers.  So this paper's worth reading, just to
   get a grip on some of those issues.  

6. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-topol-2.jpg" width="400" height="231" alt="E Topol @ Ground Truths blog: Shingles vaccine reduces dementia" title="E Topol @ Ground Truths blog: Shingles vaccine reduces dementia" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   I've had friends who got shingles; it's miserable.  When chickenpox recurs like this, it
   infects nerves, causing itching, burning, exquisitely painful welts on the skin.  And it 
   _just doesn't stop_ for months!  

   So several years ago, I got Zostavax, the then-extant shingles vaccine.  A few years
   later, an improved vaccine called Shingrix came out.  It was so dramatically better that
   even people who'd gotten Zostavax were recommended for re-vaccination.  So I did that, as
   a 2-shot series.  It was a bit gnarly, in that the side-effects the next couple days were
   worse than most other vaccines.  By "worse", I mean that I was achy, tired, mildly
   feverish, and cranky.  And _happy,_ because I was now very likely to evade the real misery
   of shingles.  

   So that should be good enough, right?  But the formidable Eric Topol presents
   evidence <sup id="fn24a">[[24]](#fn24)</sup> that Shingrix additionally actually
   _reduces the chance of developing Alzheimer's!_  

   These were "natural experiments", in that nobody set them up like that but they just
   happened due to a variety of social factors.  
   1. In the US, the rapid switchover from Zostavax to Shingrix allowed us to look at the
      rats of Alzheimer's in each.  The Shingrix cohort got a 17% reduction in diagnoses.  
   2. In Wales, the excellent socialized medicine enabled the analysis to account for other
      kinds of medical care as confounders.  Due to the way there was an age cutoff for
      Shingrix, they observed a 20% reduction in Alzheimer's in the Shingrix cohort in 7
      years of follow-up.  

   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-shingles-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-shingles-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="231" alt="Topol @ Ground Truths: Eyting &amp; Taquet report reductions in Alzheimer's from shift to Shingrix vaccine" title="Topol @ Ground Truths: Eyting &amp; Taquet report reductions in Alzheimer's from shift to Shingrix vaccine" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-shingles-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-shingles-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="391" alt="Topol @ Ground Truths: for both studies, the effect is almost all in women" title="Topol @ Ground Truths: for both studies, the effect is almost all in women" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   The top figure here shows, in both the Wales and US studies, the effect on Alzheimer's.
   Both of them show a reduction, of approximately the same order of magnitude and timed
   _exactly_ to the introduction of Shingrix.  

   Note that there is no control arm for "no vaccine" here; we're comparing 2 shingles
   vaccines.  The evidence suggests that if we had a "no vaccine" arm of unfortunates against
   whom we were comparing, there would be a 35% - 40% reduction!  This is
   _very, very strong evidence_ that you should _definitely_ get the Shingrix vaccine the
   instant you age into eligibility!  

   The bottom figure is even _more_ intriguing: in both studies, when you separate out men
   from women, _the effect is almost exclusively for women!_  Women are more prone to
   Alzheimer's (possibly because they live longer), and there's probably some difference both
   in the pathology of Alzheimer's and the immunology of vaccination.  The details of why are
   a bit unclear.  Besides the fact that understanding is better than not understanding, it
   would be nice to know if there were a way to extend the effect to men as well.  

   We also don't _quite_ know if this is a varicella zoster virus (VCV) specific effect, or if it's
   something good about vaccination in general.  But multiple bouts of shingles seem to be
   associated with increased Alzheimer's, so there's something mechanistically suggestive
   there about VCV.  It appears that VCV is neurotrophic, i.e., it
   either gets into the brain or at least has effects there.

   > dementia with a variety of vaccines including tetanus diphtheria with or without
   > pertussis, pneumococcal vaccine, flu shots, and several others &hellip;  

   Indeed, we've written before on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads about the
   [mild preventive effect some other vaccines have on Alzheimer's]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-vaccines-alzheimers/).  

   So again&hellip; vaccines are _good!_  

7. <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-science-1.jpg" width="400" height="253" alt="Cohen @ Science: Devastating NIH cancellation of HIV vaccine consortia" title="Cohen @ Science: Devastating NIH cancellation of HIV vaccine consortia" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
   On a sadder note, we're on the verge of HIV vaccinations.  There are consortia of
   academics and pharma actors researching it, mostly in mRNA vaccines.  However, 
   the Trump/Kennedy r&eacute;gime has canceled all support for
   that in the National Institute for Allergy &amp; Infectious Diseases 
   (NIAID)! <sup id="fn25a">[[25]](#fn25)</sup>  

   As reported in _Science:_  

   > In a move that could bring future research on HIV vaccines to a near halt, the National
   > Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) notified researchers today that it
   > will not renew funding next year for two major consortia in the beleaguered field,
   > _Science_ has learned. NIAID also recently stopped funding three research groups that
   > evaluate experimental vaccines in monkeys.  
   >  
   > The notification, which was communicated verbally by NIAID program officers, “couldn't
   > have happened at a worse time, because the recent clinical trial results [for candidate
   > HIV vaccines] are very promising,” says Dennis Burton of Scripps Research, who heads one
   > of the two Consortia for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Development (CHAVD).  

   Apparently questions about this to officials at HHS and NIH were met with the evasions
   typical of the today's Trump era.  It may be doubtful if they even _understood_ the question.

   There's good news elsewhere, too: solar energy is now _dramatically_ cheaper than fossil
   fuels, so the only investors in fossil fuel energy should be either fools or those coerced
   by governments into doing so.  (Not entirely coincidentally: one version of Trump's recent
   "one big beautiful bill" contained a provision to _impose taxes_ on solar and wind farms,
   to make them non-competitive again vs fossil fuels.  That didn't survive, but they have
   stated their intent to repeal tax incentives and to approve almost nothing in terms of
   solar and wind projects.  This is evil.)  

   However, every where else, solar power is just about unbelievable in scale, to the extent
   that it's reaching the normies via more or less popular media.
   <sup id="fn26a">[[26]](#fn26)</sup> <sup id="fn27a">[[27]](#fn27)</sup> (It should be
   noted that this sort of growth is typical when you're on an exponential curve, in that it always
   becomes "suddenly unbelievable".  People are _really bad_ at understanding exponentials,
   simple things that they are!)   
   - Renewables made up 96% of demand for new energy globally in 2024.  
   - In the US, 93% of new energy capacity came from solar &amp; wind.  
   - Worldwide a new gigawatt of solar infrastructure is installed _every 15 hours_ (about
     the output of a big old coal plant).  
   - In 2023, China installed _more solar infrastructure than the next 9 countries combined._  

9. But rather than be a participant in the good news, Trump is instead _actively disabling_
   anything climate-related.  The Trump administration is not only shutting down most of NOAA
   (to muzzle climate research and give his friends a for-profit opportunity to replace it).
   Now according to Sen Markey (D-MA), they are not only shutting down government, but
   _actively disabling instruments_ so that weather prediction and climate research are crippled:

## The Weekend Conclusion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-fire-the-scientists.jpg" width="400" height="310" alt="Cartoon by Stahler: fire the scientists when they disagree with Trump; NB the orange mouths on the GOP Congress" title="Cartoon by Stahler: fire the scientists when they disagree with Trump; NB the orange mouths on the GOP Congress" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So&hellip; it's just _hard_ for me to write now about vaccines, or science in general.  It
seems we live in a cartoon world now, and not one of your better cartoons.  

This cartoon by [Jeff Stahler](https://www.gocomics.com/jeffstahler), for instance, seems
to capture the _zeitgeist:_  
- Trump says or does something stupid,  
- Republicans back him up,  
- scientists (or any of the fact professions, really) try to inject some reality,  
- Trump cuts their funding, calls them traitor commie pedophiles, and the Trump supporter death
  threats start coming in.  
  
Absolutely _nothing_ in that sequence is an exaggeration.  Sadly.  

To be honest, life in the US now feels like this perverse version of the
[trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) involving billionaires,
proposed by some internet wag.  
- The trolley problem was invented by philosopher
  [Phillippa Foote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Foot) in about 1967, to help
  thinking about the [doctrine of double effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_double_effect):
  actions have complicated effects, some of which you may want and others you may not.  

  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-trolley-problem-billionaires.jpg" width="400" height="463" alt="Phillippa Foot's trolley problem: as we imagine it, and as billionaires imagine it, colluding to get the rest of us killed" title="Phillippa Foot's trolley problem: as we imagine it, and as billionaires imagine it, colluding to get the rest of us killed" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
  In its (near-)original formulation (upper part of the illustration), you are at the
  control lever of a train switch.  An unstoppable trolley car is approaching.  People are
  tied to the tracks.  You can either throw the switch so as to kill 1 person, or to kill
  5 persons.  
  
  Most people have the wit do do a little moral calculation, valuing lives roughly equally,
  and kill the fewest number of people.  ("Double effect": on the one hand, you minimize
  deaths, but on the other hand, you still kill _somebody._)  
  
  This problem famously has about a billion variations, with varying levels of absurdity.  
- In the perverse billionaire-controlled formulation (lower part of illustration), you are
  in fact not in control of anything.  You are one of the 5 unfortunates tied to the
  track.  
  
  The person tied to the other track is a billionaire.  
  
  The person at the switch is _another_ billionaire.  
  
  The 2 billionaires are exchanging thumbs-up signals, i.e., the trolley will be diverted
  to _kill everyone else_ in order to save the billionaire tied to the tracks.

The rights, comfort, and prerogatives of the rich are all that matter.  No laws, no
ethics, no traditions, and not even _physics_ may be permitted to intervene.  

That's exactly the feeling conveyed by this bit of street art for July 4th, reported by 
[Instagrammer jdlstreetart](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLrbOVStn1B/?hl=en) from
[Roubaix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roubaix), in northern France.  The 36 seconds of striking aerial
drone footage show a weeping Statue of Liberty, covering her face in shame and grief.  

Shame, grief, and tears are (for now) the consequences of our choices.  How bad those
consequences will soon become&hellip; that's what I fear.  The US is in a dark and
dangerous place now, about to become _much_ darker and more dangerous.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-guardian-1.jpg" width="400" height="435" alt="Monbiot @ Guardian: Nothing gets better until the oligarchs are gone" title="Monbiot @ Guardian: Nothing gets better until the oligarchs are gone" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
George Monbiot, writing in _The Guardian_ about a year ago <sup id="fn28a">[[28]](#fn28)</sup>,
reminds us that things won't get better so long as we let the oligarchs capture most of
the economic production's wealth and turn it into political power for themselves.  (He's
speaking particularly of British politics of 2024, but the lessons are more general.)  

What we mostly regard as the "normal" post-WWII period was in fact quite extraordinary:  

> What is the “normal” envisaged by pundits and politicians of the left and centre? It is
> the most anomalous politics in the history of the world. Consciously or otherwise, they
> hark back to a remarkable period, roughly 1945 to 1975, in which, in certain rich
> nations, wealth and power were distributed, almost everyone could aspire to decent
> housing, wages and conditions, public services were ambitious and well-funded and a
> robust economic safety net prevented destitution. There had never been a period like it
> in the prior history of the world, and there has not been one since.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-16-vaccine-writing-hard-compression.jpg" width="400" height="105" alt="Goldin &amp; Margo @ Qrtrly Jnl Econ: The Great Compression" title="Goldin &amp; Margo @ Qrtrly Jnl Econ: The Great Compression" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The 1930s through the 1970s are what economists Claudia Goldin &amp; Robert A. Margo
describe as the "Great Compression". <sup id="fn29a">[[29]](#fn29)</sup>  The Great
Depression caused political demand for a much more redistributive tax system and great
investment in public works.  The World Wars used up or destroyed much of the capital of
the very rich.  The postwar education programs democratized access to professions.  

The result was that the 90-10 ratio in log wages went from 1.45 in 1940 to 1.06 in 1950.
That is, the scale of wages compressed so much, the term "Great Compression" is apt
(despite the way the sounds recall "Great Depression").  This changed the US profoundly,
and for the better (though it did not solve all problems, especially if you were a woman,
a racial minority, an immigrant, or LGBTQ).  

Back to Monbiot, on how extraordinary the Great Compression was:  

> The history of many centuries, including our own, shows that the default state of
> politics is not redistribution and general welfare, but a spiral of accumulation by the
> very rich, the extreme exploitation of labour, the seizure of common resources and
> exaction of rent for their use, extortion, coercion and violence.
> __Normal is a society in which might is right. Normal is oligarchy.__  
> &hellip;  
> In the absence of &hellip; great catastrophes, income and capital inexorably
> accumulate in the hands of the few, and oligarchy returns. __Oligarchs are people who
> translate their inordinate economic power into inordinate political power. They build a
> politics that suits them.__  
> &hellip;  
> If you want a return to the rich nations’ “normality” of 1945 to 1975 – in other words,
> to redistribution, a shared sense of national purpose, robust public services and a
> strong economic safety net, high employment and good wages – and I think most people
> would, you need a politics that is not just abnormal, but unprecedented.  &hellip; We
> would need to do what the world wars did, without the violence and physical destruction:
> __a peacetime MacArthur programme for overthrowing the oligarchs.__  

This is what the American billionaire [Peter Thiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel#:~:text=Thiel%20explained%20in%20a%202009,new%20technologies)
meant in his foundational essay for the [neo-reactionary/Dark Enlightenment movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment):  

> Thiel explained in a 2009 essay that he had come to "no longer believe that freedom and
> democracy are compatible", __due in large part to welfare beneficiaries and women__ in
> general being "notoriously tough for libertarians" constituencies&hellip;  

Note the explicit contempt for women and the poor.  They also hold the rest of us in
contempt, and now use their power to shape laws to that effect.  

The real question is how much longer we tolerate this.  

In the meantime, about some subjects, it is much harder for me to write optimistically.
