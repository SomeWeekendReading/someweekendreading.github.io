Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been controversial: people continue to object loudly and
strongly to things like masking, social distancing, and closures of schools and
workplaces.  We now have some retrospective data: how have each of those measures
performed, in terms of live saved for the complaints they've caused?  


## A study of COVID-19 NPIs in 130 countries  

From Delthia Ricks comes a heads-up to a study on NPI's vs COVID-19 world-wide:

She's referring to a worldwide study of NPI effectiveness during the pandemic by
researchers mostly based at the University of Manchester (England), published a couple
weeks ago in _BMC Public Health._ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

The authors are careful to point out (in the first sentence of the abstract, no less!)
that while NPIs are empirically known to work, they:
- Can have negative effects on mental health (as we are all painfully aware) and on
  economies (as the current supply chain madness demonstrates), and  
- Can be a result of voluntary action by people ahead of a mandate.  For example, in Japan
  wearing of face masks to prevent disease transmission (even as simple as a cold) is
  customary.  Since everybody masked up immediately, a mask mandate would have no effect.
  Conservatives would point to that and say "See?  Masks don't work!" when exactly the
  opposite is true.  
  
They studied the first wave of COVID-19 "to limit reverse causality", i.e., people looking
back at what worked in the first wave to decide what to do in the subsequent waves.  So
we're looking at 0 - 24 days and 14 - 38 days after the first COVID-19 death in each
country.  This properly accounts for the lag in deaths from onset of infection, which is
the only thing policies can affect.  (It does not appear they corrected for the fact that
countries with later waves could look at those with earlier waves to see what worked and
what did not?)  

They studied 9 NPIs in 130 countries tracked by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response
Tracker (OxCGRT):  
- school closing  
- workplace closing  
- cancelled public events  
- restrictions on gatherings  
- closing public transport  
- stay at home requirements ('lockdown')  
- restrictions on internal movement  
- international travel controls   
- public information campaigns  

While they display the usual reluctance to show any math common to biology/medical/public
health folk, there are a few clues we can glean (mostly from the Supplement).  It looks
like they mostly did a set of linear regressions of per capita deaths over time separately by
country, on the various policy variables and confounders.
- Univariate linear regressions of per-capita death rates on policies were apparently used for 
  [feature selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_selection), though they didn't
  quite use that word.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-21-npi-efficiency-bmcph-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-21-npi-efficiency-bmcph-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="130" alt="Stokes, et al. @ BMC Pub Health: Telegraphic summary of regression model" title="Stokes, et al. @ BMC Pub Health: Telegraphic summary of regression model" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Then they started combining policies together, along with a variety of confounders
  including day of week and week of year to account for weekend dropouts and seasonality.
  That's the model reported in the main manuscript, as shown here from the Supplement.
- They also did some nonlinear modeling using a generalized linear model (GLM) with apparently a
  [negbinomial link function](https://timeseriesreasoning.com/contents/negative-binomial-regression-model/), 
  to model counts.  However, this does not appear to have made it into the main
  manuscript, nor does it appear to have influenced their conclusions.  I'm not sure why
  it was included!  

As is _always the case_ when authors exile math to the Supplement, it was written with
an uncritical hand and they kind of made a hash of it.  I _sort of_ grasp what they did,
but not enough to check.  Very frustrating!  


<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-21-npi-efficiency-bmcph-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-21-npi-efficiency-bmcph-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="257" alt="Stokes, et al. @ BMC Pub Health, Fig 1: Policy effects by country" title="Stokes, et al. @ BMC Pub Health, Fig 1: Policy effects by country" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Figure 1, reproduced here, shows the empirical association between the daily per capita
death rates and various policies.  
- Each plot calls out a particular country; the US is the 2nd plot from the left in the
  bottom row.  
- The horizontal axis is time, starting at 0 from the first COVID-19 death.  The study
  periods are from 0 to 24 days and to 14 38 days, with ending periods shown by the
  vertical dashed lines.  
- The vertical axis is the per capita daily death rate, in deaths per million.  The data
  has been smoothed with a locally weighted regression with bandwidth 0.2.  I _think_ that
  means something vaguely like a convolution with a Gaussian (possibly causal) or a local
  linear regression in a sliding window with some sort of weighting&hellip; but of course
  they don't disclose enough detail to tell!  
- The colored red and blue lines indicate when various policies kick in.  Red is the most
  stringent level, and one or two levels below that are indicated in blue.  
  
We see clearly the awful shape of the first wave's death rates.  But we also see that this
is a pretty gnarly multivariate statistical problem.  We'd best use more careful models
than simply eyeballing the data!  As the authors say:  

> Notably, elucidating mortality impacts from separate interventions using visual aids, or
> statistically without controlling for those co-introduced, is problematic given the

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-21-npi-efficiency-bmcph-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-21-npi-efficiency-bmcph-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="308" alt="Stokes, et al. @ BMC Pub Health, Fig 2: Regression coefficients and confidence intervals for policies on per-capita death rates" title="Stokes, et al. @ BMC Pub Health, Fig 2: Regression coefficients and confidence intervals for policies on per-capita death rates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Figure 2, reproduced here, shows the result of that more nuanced analysis.  It's a pooled
cross-sectional regression (regress in each country, and combine the results) of the
effects of all 9 interventions, both based on strictness and timing.  Stricter and earlier
interventions worked better, saving more lives.  

- Here the horizontal axis is the regression coefficient, with the mean shown with a dot and
  the 95% confidence limits indicated by the whisker.  
- An intervention is effective if the coefficient is negative.  
- An intervention is statistically significant at the $p \lt 0.05$ level if the confidence
  interval whisker is bounded below 0.  

The results seem to be:  
- __School closures__ were effective and statistically significant in the 14-38 day period, and
  negative but not quite statistically significant in the 0-14 day period.  
- __Workplace closures__ were effective and statistically significant in the 0-14 day period,
  and effective but not quite statistically significant in the 14-38 day period.  
- __Travel restrictions__ were effective in both periods, but just barely not statistically
  significant.  
- No other intervention was statistically significant, and indeed all of them were sometimes
  _ineffective_, i.e., increasing per capita death rates, in at least one period.  

(__NB:__ Mask usage was not tested, and cannot be analyzed from these data.)  

Note that the interventions that mattered were both publicly measurable, and hence could
be made mandatory and enforced.  The more voluntary, at-home interventions were not
publicly measurable, and thus enforcement more spotty.  As the authors said:

The school closure efficacy is interesting.  Kids may not be personally affected so much
by COVID-19, but they can be asymptomatic carriers who infect their elders, and thus bump up
the death rate.  _Low personal risk is not low public risk!_  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The findings are clear:  
- School closures were effective (-1.23 daily deaths per million, 95% CL -2.20 to -0.27).  
- Workplace closures were effective (-0.26 daily deaths per million, 95% CL -0.46 to -0.05).  
- Both of those were _mandatory;_ by comparison voluntary measures were not effective.  
- These findings were robust across multiple statistical techniques, e.g., both ordinary
  least squares regression and negbinomial regression.  
- Masks were not tested, so we can draw no conclusions from these data.  However, based on
  other data, I believe they would have been found highly effective.  

Of course, the _most_ effective preventive measure is vaccination, so that's the first
avenue to pursue.  
  
The most effective NPIs are the measures about which people, particularly conservatives,
whine incessantly.  _But they save lives!_ Do you value your ideology more than you value
the lives of your neighbors?!  The evidence says that American Republicans do indeed cling to
their ideology with a sociopathic degree of self-regard.  But their policies are factually
incorrect, and their embrace of those policies is morally incorrect.
