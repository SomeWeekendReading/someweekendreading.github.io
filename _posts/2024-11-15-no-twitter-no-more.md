No Twitter.  No more.  


## Nope.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/icon-two-tone-twitter-not.png" width="400" height="400" alt="No Twitter, no more." title="No Twitter, no more." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-11-15-no-twitter-no-more-twitter.jpg" width="400" height="365" alt="No Twitter, No More" title="No Twitter, No More" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Here on this Crummy Little Blog that Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), readers with an eye for detail &ndash;
should there be any &ndash; will have noticed a change to the icons in the navigation bar
at the top of every page.  The Twitter link is now as shown here, with the universal
slash-circle "No" drawn over it in red.  

It now hyperlinks to nowhere.  

Even more persistent readers, remembering the old Twitter account, will find the other
image confronting them: there is no such Twitter account any more.  

With the election of That Felon, my pessimism knows  no bounds.  The fact that Musk is
aiding and abetting this moral crime was just my last straw.  I'd pretty much stopped
posting there except for blog announcements, and I only checked tweets from people I know
personally.  Still&hellip; that was too much.  

Also, as of today, any remaining account is forcibly opted in to allowing their AI golem
to train on customer text.  I can't stand the thought of letting everything I wrote be fed
through the word-chipper of a fascist billionaire who wants nothing more than to gut
Medicare and Social Security.  

So: no Twitter, no more.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

But the BlueSky and Mastodon icons above are still useful!  At least, if you mean "finding
Weekend Editor posts" as one of the definitions of "useful".  (A debatable point, I
acknowledge.)

Nope.
