On Monday 2022-Feb-15 the FDA's VRBPAC will meet to consider Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for
ages 6mo - 2yr.  It worked for 6mo - 2yr, but not for 2yr - 4yr.  A 3rd dose is being
tested for 2yr - 4yr, but the FDA _invited_ this application so parents can get their kids
started on the first 2 doses while waiting for data on the 3rd.  Unusual?  Very!  

## Meeting Materials  

Honestly, I just dunno what's going on any more.  The FDA practically never _invites_
applications, especially _before_ the trial data is in.  But&hellip; here we are: 
- A vaccine that works in kids over age 5 and adults,
- And for which a trial says it works in age 6mos - 2yr,
- But for which it _didn't_ work in ages 2yr - 5yr.  

Rather than go back to the drawing board or try another dose, the FDA and Pfizer decided
maybe it was a 3-shot vaccine after all for ages 2yr - 5yr, and are doing an extension of
the trial to test that.  

_But that 3rd dose trial is not yet finished!_  

And yet, here we are.  The best rationalization I've heard is that parents want to "get
started", since they'll have to wait 6mos for the 3rd shot.  I mean, it sort of makes
sense&hellip; but I've never seen anything like it before.

If you want to read ahead, the meeting materials will start appearing online at the
VRBPAC's page for this meeting. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  Right now, the only
thing there is some financial disclosure stuff.  

More will appear today &amp; over the weekend.  Somehow the VRBPAC members are supposed to
read it all before the meeting, which makes it awkward that it's not there _now._  But
that's probably the least awkward fact about this whole little circus.
