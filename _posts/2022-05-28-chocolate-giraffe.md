Have you ever eaten a giraffe?  


## Of course not!  

"[Never ever in my life have I](https://ell.stackexchange.com/questions/89344/never-in-my-life-did-i-vs-never-in-my-life-had-i) eaten a giraffe!", you may well protest.  Nor have I, despite my non-vegetarian ways.  

But would it change your mind if the giraffe were to be made of chocolate?  

Thought so.  


## Chocolate sculpture: a life-size chocolate giraffe  

It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a chef in possession of a kitchen, must be in
want of a mania.  Or something like that.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>

Not to disappoint this expectation, via _BoingBoing_ comes news (regrettably on Instagram)
from chef Amaury Gichon, a chocolate sculptor. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  Gichon is
co-founder of [The Pastry Academy](https://thepastryacademy.com/) in Las Vegas, Nevada in the US.
The Bayesian posterior probability of silliness is of course much larger than the prior,
given you know it's Las Vegas, right?  

Now, I love [_trompe l'&oelig;il_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trompe-l%27%C5%93il) food
nonsense as well as the next guy.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> But this 8.3ft (2.53m)
tall chocolate giraffe is some next-level stuff.  For one thing, "life-sized chocolate
giraffe" is another of those phrases I never thought would be useful in actual practice.
Yet, here we are.  

Unlike nearly all of Instagram, the video is actually worth a quick watch if only to
appreciate the excellence of his art.   

For me, it's a lot like watching the Olympics: while I am possibly the least
sports-interested male in North America, the Olympics are interesting to watch people
attempt perfection.  <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>
