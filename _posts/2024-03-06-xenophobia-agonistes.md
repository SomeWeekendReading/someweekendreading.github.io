Sometimes you think the fascists, confederates, and Republicans just can't get any worse,
or any more clueless.  Then you wake up.  


## Q: Do the Republican Racists and Xenophobes Struggle With What They're Saying?  

In 1671, English poet [John Milton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milton) published
[_Samson Agonistes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Agonistes), a poem about Samson
whose title translates to something like "Samson the Champion", or "Samson the One who
Struggles".  The suffix "Agonistes" has been used, for a good long while since, for
characters who struggle.  
- [TS Eliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot)'s unfinished
  [_Sweeney Agonistes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweeney_Agonistes) is one example.  
- Another less serious example is, back in the day, there was an undergrad writing for the
  MIT student newspaper, [_The Tech_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tech_(newspaper)),
  named [Simson Garfinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simson_Garfinkel), occasionally
  referred to as "Simson Agonistes".  I enjoyed his writing then, and apparently he's gone
  on to have quite a distinguished career.  And yes, at least some MIT students are
  literate enough to get the "Agonistes" joke.  
  
So, in the spirit of the political struggle of the time: how hard are our right-wing
fascists struggling with their xenophobia about immigration?


## A: Yes, They Struggle &ndash; But They Lose the Fight vs Reality  

The answer appears to be that (a) they struggle mightily, but (b) they always lose the
battle with reality.  That is, the racism is so outlandish that it would be hilarious if
it were fictional.  As actual news, it leaves somewhat to be desired.  

[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about a news report
from 2018.  Initially, I was suspicious that a news report from 6 years ago, when Trump
was still president, could have much relevance.  But&hellip; it's a _doozy._

It seems that on 2018-Jan-25, Trump knuckleheads were demonstrating against immigration.
They didn't have too fine a grasp of "legal" vs "illegal" immigration, since apparently
anyone with brown skin was to them a potential illegal.  They were also _armed._  

Now, an armed, angry mob of white people actively intimidating others about "supporting
illegal immigration" and harassing anyone with brown skin to "get out of the country" is
worth noting as the racist incitement to violence that it is.  And, for that matter,
prosecuting it, but we live in debased times where that is apparently beyond us.  

What makes it even more interesting is that they were doing it at the
_Arizona state capitol building_, and the people targeted were legislative staff and
legislators.  For example, they pointed at one woman of US citizenship and Hispanic
descent, yelling "Get out, go back home!"  They pointed at her white colleague and said,
"No, you can stay."  

This was first reported in the _Arizona Capitol Times_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
but then picked up nationally by _Raw Story_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> and 
_The Hill_. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  It's
_such_ a bizarre story that inevitably _Snopes_ weighed in <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>
to fact-check it, and gave it a "TRUE" rating.  At that point, with 3 news sources and
Snopes backing the fact-check, it's a pretty solid story.  Not only that, there's video.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-03-06-xenophobia-agonistes-descheenie-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-03-06-xenophobia-agonistes-descheenie-1.jpg" width="400" height="258" alt="AZ state rep Eric Descheenie" title="AZ state rep Eric Descheenie" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
What makes it just about the perfect example of finely-tuned, weapons-grade stupidity is
when the Trumpists did this to Representative Eric Descheenie.  He's the handsome, if
somewhat aggravated-looking, gentleman shown here.  His aggravation is well-earned:  
- First, an angry armed mob of white people attempting to intimidate a _legislator_ should
  be a major crime.  This is especially true when armed intimidation is done for political
  purposes, as the pro-Trump demonstration clearly was.  
- Second, Descheenie is Navajo.  His immediate family has been there for many centuries.
  If one looks somewhat more broadly at the other Native American people were ancestral to
  the Navajo Nation, one can easily argue that his people have been in Americas for
  [18,000 to 26,000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States#:~:text=The%202021%20findings%20of%20fossilized%20human%20footprints%20in%20relict%20lake%20sediments%20near%20White%20Sands%20National%20Park%20in%20present%2Dday%20New%20Mexico%20suggest%20a%20human%20presence%20there%20dating%20back%20to%20the%20Last%20Glacial%20Maximum%20(LGM)%2C%20between%2018%2C000%20and%2026%2C000%20years%20ago.%5B36%5D%5B37%5D%5B38%5D)
  based on hard scientific evidence from archaeological, anthropological, and genetic
  sources.  

You _do not_ get to ask Native Americans if they're here "legally".  Their claims to being
here "legally" are almost certainly superior to your own.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

This is xenophobia, racism, and lethally concentrated stupidity.  That's what evil really
is: a refusal to see the good in the world, but instead just to be, quite literally,
hell-bent on destruction.
