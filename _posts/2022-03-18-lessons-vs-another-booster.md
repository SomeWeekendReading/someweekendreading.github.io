We would like to think we've learned a few things from our collective COVID-19 experience,
but the evidence is somewhat equivocal.  What we've _definitely_ learned is that there
will almost certainly be another booster.  


## Asking your tolerance  

Here at Chez Weekend, we've just upgraded from an 11 year old (!) Mac to a brand-new one
(Macbook pro 16in, M1Max ARM CPU, 64Gb RAM, 2Tb SSD storage).  While it's nice &ndash;
_very_ nice &ndash; things post-migration are nontheless more than a little rough around
the edges.  "Rough" as in, so far it's lost _all_ my music and videos, about which I am
_not_ happy!  

So we beg your tolerance for a few days to weeks while we iron out the kinks.  

In the meantime, we have news to think about and a new computer to put through its paces
to make sure we have all our ducks in a row, blogging tool-wise.  


## What have we learned?  

So, yeah: what _have_ we learned, if anything?  A couple years ago &ndash; _years_ ago!
&ndash; I was asked to say something to our relgious community on what we could learn from
"all this" (by which phrase the pandemic was delicately euphemized), as it was then
euphemized.  Without getting into religious detail, I somewhat mildly observed that
I hoped we could perhaps learn:  
- A sociopathically self-centered view is both cruel and dooms ourselves and the world around us,  
- Compassion is among the cardinal virtues,  
- Comforting those in pain is _important_,
- Aid for the poor, care for the sick, and justice for the oppressed are among the most
  important ways of exalting each other with atonement and generous forgiveness,  
- ... and that perhaps those mutual grants of forgiveness could be life-changing.  

Let's see what the punditocracy thinks we've learned.

David Leonhardt at the _NYT_ has a few observations on the politial stratification of not
just vaccination, but COVID precautions in general <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

> The key dividing line appears to be ideology. Americans who identify as "very liberal"
> are much more worried about Covid than Americans who identify as "somewhat liberal" or
> "liberal." Increasingly, the very liberal look like outliers on Covid: The merely
> liberal are sometimes closer to moderates than to the very liberal.  

While the difference shows up everywhere, from attitudes about vaccination to whether
COVID-19 is even real, it shows up very strongly as shown here in opinions on masking
strategy.  Conservatives _hate_ masking, almost as much as they hate the rest of us.  

Now, to be sure, liberals are turning out a bit like Japanese, where masking is just an
ordinary courtesy done on an everyday basis by people who have even a simple cold.  The
Japanese side of my family simply _cannot_ understand why the American right spits venom
over masking.  Nor can I.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-18-lessons-vs-another-booster-nymag-1.jpg" width="400" height="317" alt="Adler-Bell @ NYMag: Why so many liberals are mad at Leonhardt" title="Adler-Bell @ NYMag: Why so many liberals are mad at Leonhardt" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
But when Leonhardt begins to appeal for relaxation of COVID-19 precautions, I part
company.  I don't really get on board with economic arguments about the "costs" of
precautions, when the costs of non-precautions are human lives.  An _easily avoidable_
human death is a morally shameful thing over which to argue economics.  

As Sam Adler-Bell argues in _NY Mag_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, anger at Leonhardt
is a usual sort of thing among us liberals, and for approximately this reason:  
 
> Recently, Leonhardt has used his personal front page to amplify a particular message:
> that the emergency phase of the COVID pandemic is over and that the persistent degree of
> anxiety and COVID-mitigation efforts in Blue America are not only ineffectual but doing
> more harm than good.  

It's that trade-off, where we just indulge in a _little bit_ of human sacrifice for the
sake of the moneyed interests, that really hacks me off.  A daily death rate of more than
2,000/day is not "time for return to normal".  That is _not_ an acceptable new normal, nor
should it be to anyone with any more conscience than a predator.  It _is,_ however, a 9/11
event _every day._ This is not victory over COVID-19, is simple and pointless surrender to
be massacred.  It is largely a surrender of the lives of the poor and the
immunocompromised, especially in the developing nations. This may not afflict affluent
consciences&hellip; but it _should._  

It is, in Adler-Bell's terms, "a self-satisfied state of necro-normalcy in which thousands
of lives are disposable".  It sets us up for the next wave, currently hinted at in the
[cryptic SARS-CoV2 sequences in NYC wastewater]({{ site.baseurl }}/sars-cov2-cryptic/),
against early surrender:

To be fair: I have to acknowledge, and gratefully, that Leonhardt does often work very
hard to be clear, and even _pretty_ hard to find hopeful news, even about COVID-19.  I'm
just not on board with the rush to normalcy and its required human sacrifices.  So
Leonhardt is a valuable informant: he tells us the truth as best he knows it on most
issues, and on this issue he's wrong but at least tells us what people on that side are
thinking.  And does so in clear, engaging prose, which is no small thing.  

So, Leonhardt: good job&hellip; _mostly._  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-18-lessons-vs-another-booster-stat-1.jpg" width="400" height="236" alt="Branswell @ STAT: 2021 year-end reflections on lessons of COVID-19" title="Branswell @ STAT: 2021 year-end reflections on lessons of COVID-19" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Let's turn next to the estimable Helen Branswell, writing at _STAT News_ in a 2021
year-end retrospective on what she'd then learned from the COVID-19 
pandemic. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>

Yeah, no kidding.  Here's her top 10 list:  

1. __You gotta act fast.__  2020-Jan through Feb was spent denying or failing to grasp
   what was happening.  That was the one chance the world had at control, and we dropped
   it on the floor.  Bad choice.  Exponentials move fast, and you don't get to wait "until
   the situation clarifies."  (The hell of it is, in the viewpoint from Ch&acirc;teau
   Weekend, _we keep repeating that mistake_ at every wave.  At least we should make
   exciting new mistakes, no?)  
2. __Simplicity rules.__  We got way smarter than was good for us, trying to quantify who
   qualified as an essential worker, or immunocompromised, or even elderly to be first in
   line for vaccinations.  Policies have to be simple enough to be executed almost without
   thought, because &ndash; sadly &ndash; most people _will not stop to think_.  (Or if
   they do, they'll just argue while the pandemic rages.)  Age strata and health care
   workers were simple criteria, and could do the job.  Again,
   _we repeated this mistake_ with boosters, because nobody could figure out who was
   eligible and everybody wanted to argue about it.  
3. __The calculus for kids is just different.__  Children are not just like adults, only
   smaller.  That's why we have pediatricians, because they know what _else_ is
   different.  They have different risks for COVID-19, as well as different responses to
   vaccination.  (Don't get me started about MIS-C caused by COVID-19, but with much higher
   risk from COVID-19 than any vaccine risk.)  Nonetheless, politically and socially, we
   won't accept _any_ death rate in children (compared to elders), so any strategy that is
   executable in the real world must cope with this.  
4. __Even in the face of a deadly pandemic, politics override public health.__  I _hate_
   this fact.  It reminds me of reading, many years ago of a US pilot shot down in Viet
   Nam, captured by the NVA with a broken leg.  He was told: "You have a medical problem
   and a political problem.  In this country, we solve political problems first."  That's
   evil and stupid on so many levels&hellip; but we have political leaders on the right
   who sound just like that.  They adopt policies which, _by design,_ kill their
   constituents and crate massive economic and social damage.  But they persist.  
5. __Most people have no clue how science works. And that’s a problem.__  See why I like
   Helen?  Our woefully inadequate educational system, unworthy of the most underdeveloped
   nations, makes Americans think science is like magic rather than an iterative,
   self-correcting process that converges on the truth by stages.  Every time guidance was
   updated, people claimed science doesn't work, vaccines don't work, or the whole world
   is a conspiracy of gargatuan prorportions and brobdingnagian stupidity.  
6. __Downplaying what lies ahead helps no one.__  Yup, people correctly call this "lying."
   Especially when Trump said COVID-19 will "just disappear", or was "just the flu", or
   any number of other knotheaded things.  
7. __Winning the vaccine race really does matter. So does experience.__  The Moderna
   vaccine, given at higher doses, is looking like the better one now.  But Pfizer knew
   more than a little bit about regulatory filing and commercialization, so got out
   front.  Fortunately for everyone, while there may be shades of difference between them,
   both vaccines are _excellent._  
8. __In a pandemic, it’s pretty much every country for itself.__  This is a terrible thing
   to realize about oneself, second only to the refusal to recognize it.  When Jared
   Kushner wanted vaccine providers to prioritize the US, he was starting down the road to
   the Hobbesian war of all against all.  Only a terrible person thinks this is a virtue.  
9. __Conducting clinical trials during a pandemic is doable, but it takes coordination.__
   To which I would add: it's hard even under the best of circumstances, and damn near
   impossible under pandemic circumstances.  I am ever so slightly in awe of the people
   who could do this.  When they speak on this subject, I will shut my mouth, sit down,
   and listen respectfully.  They deserve that, and more.  (It would be nice if the US
   would join the civilized world in having true universal health care with unified
   electronic medical records so we could do some more of that ourselves, domestically and
   faster.)  
10. __Americans are willing to put up with a lot of death.__  Why is that, exactly?  And
    more to the point, _what is wrong with us?_  We're going to hit 1 million _dead_ in
    the US quite soon, and it's now about 6 million dead in the rest of the world.  Several
    daunting facts:  
	- The US is 4% of the world population, but 16% of the world's COVID-19 deaths.  Why
      do we tolerate _dying at 4x the rate of the rest of the world?_  Wouldn't you think
      that calling for a universal healthcare system like theirs would be a reasoable
      reaction?  
	- The true number of COVID-19 deaths is probably 3x that much, based on excess death
      rates over previous year baselines.  So&hellip; 3 million dead in the US and 18
      million world-wide.  That's a major war's casualties.  Why exactly do we fight _against_
      ourselves, again?  
    - More of those deaths were in 2021, _after_ vaccine availability.  We _could_ have
      saved ourselves, but we _would_ not.  

Branswell offers a counterpoint to Leonhardt's appeal for a return to "necro-normalcy":  

> And still, __more people died from Covid in 2021 than died from Covid in 2020__. In 2021,
> swaths of the country fought mask mandates, opposed vaccination mandates, objected to
> any measure designed to slow the spread of Covid that they perceived as an impediment on
> their ability to resume pre-pandemic activities.  
>  
> __This insistence on returning to life as normal came at an unfathomable cost — the loss
> of hundreds of thousands of parents, grandparents, great-grandparents. Aunts and
> great-aunts, uncles, and great uncles. Cousins. Friends. Coworkers and supervisors.__  And
> still, big chunks of the population refused to get vaccinated, refused to wear masks,
> insisted SARS-2 was a hoax, or was no more threatening than the flu.  
> 
> "It almost is inexplicable," Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of
> Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told me when I asked him about this last month.   
>  
> For me, it is incomprehensible.  

Yeah, me too.  

It's like watching [Moloch in action](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/):
the right senses political points to be made, and sacrifices human lives to get them.
And they do it _proudly._  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-18-lessons-vs-another-booster-stat-2.jpg" width="400" height="262" alt="Cohrs @ STAT: Haven't we learned anything?" title="Cohrs @ STAT: Haven't we learned anything?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Rachel Cohrs, also writing at the usually-excellent _STAT News_, has some disturbing
evidence that we are _actively refusing_ to learn from the pandemic. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>

Last week, Congress failed to provide additional funding for COVID-19 response, in
particular to purchase treatments like monoclonal antibodies and drugs like paxlovid and
molnupiravir, and the testing capacity to support using them effectively.  Our right wing
would prefer political posturing, even though people die as a result.  

An analogy:  

> "It would be going out and purchasing fire trucks the moment the 911 calls come in to

> Minnesota and former Covid-19 adviser to President Biden.  
> &hellip;  
> "To not fully fund these programs, you are playing with an infectious disease fire, and

Yup, it's really that stupid.  Unnecessary death and chaos.

> to be some remedy."  

Stronger language than "dismayed" and "disquieted" is called for here, though Topol is as
ever being diplomatic.  The problem is the right mistakes diplomacy for wishy-washy
weakness.  It's apaprently part of the Moloch-driven power-seeking syndrome, or
something.  

> "Failing means people dying, and getting severely ill unnecessarily, and it's
> preventable. I wouldn't be able to sleep at night if I were responsible for that," Topol

I'm sure Republicans sleep just fine.  Like, you know, Dracula.  And Joe Manchin, for that matter.  


## Pfizer and Moderna booster applications

It's clear we've learned _some_ things, though not necessarily the things we'd like to
have learned.  Lots of our learning was about our self-inflicted political dysfunction in
the US.  

However, we _have_ learned that mRNA vaccines are pretty wonderful!  And this week came
the good news that both Pfizer/BioNTech <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> and
Moderna  <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> have filed with the FDA for authorization of
another booster.  True to its more aggressive past, Moderna filed for all adults while
Pfizer filed for seniors over 65.  

This news is pretty widely reported in the popular media.  For example, just picking some
of the more reliable news sources favored by your humble Weekend Editor, there were
reports of both on NPR <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>,
in the _New York Times_ <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>, <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>,
and in the _Washington Post_. <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>, <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  

(_Don't_ bother with the Twitter comments, which are along the lines of "how many more doses
before they're effective?"  You don't need that kind of sewage pumped at high pressure
into your head.  Really, you don't.  _Nobody_ needs that.)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-18-lessons-vs-another-booster-ukhsa-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-18-lessons-vs-another-booster-ukhsa-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="133" alt="UKHSA: Vaccine efficacy waning vs Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, by dose and timing" title="UKHSA: Vaccine efficacy waning vs Omicron BA.1 and BA.2, by dose and timing" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The Pfizer press release in particular, has a nice meaty bibliography to it, reporting on
evidence of vaccine waining in the US <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>, the Qatar data
on the duration of protection <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup>, vaccine efficacy vs
Omicron in particular in the US <sup id="fn15a">[[15]](#fn15)</sup>, vaccine efficacy vs
Omicron in the UK <sup id="fn16a">[[16]](#fn16)</sup>, a study of efficacy declines vs
Omicron BA.1 vs Omicron BA.2 in England showing waning down to
50% <sup id="fn17a">[[17]](#fn17)</sup> (see table on p. 13, reproduced here), and 2
Israeli studies of the efficacy vs Omicron of a 4th
dose. <sup id="fn18a">[[18]](#fn18)</sup> <sup id="fn19a">[[19]](#fn19)</sup>  

You may notice an uncomfortable fact about those references: they are mostly from sites
outside the United States, in countries that have comprehensive, universal health care for
all residents and a unified electronic medical records system.  In the US we have neither
of those, preferring a balkanized for-profit system continually at war with itself and
with patient welfare.  We really shoudl get on that one of these days, no?  

But let me emphasize: this is based on _multiple eal-world datasets_, involving real patient
populations in the wild, going about their business, mostly in Israel or Qatar.  These are
not tiny datasets, either: there were $N = 1.1 \times 10^{6}$ patients involved in just
one of them.  Rates of infection were 2x lower, and rates of severe disease were 4x
lower.  

Another study of health-care workers showed 7x to 8x increases in antibody titers, and an
8x to 10x increase in antibodys _specifically to Omicron_.  

These are _statistically significant_ and show clinically meaningful _strength of
effect._  Respectively, those 2 things mean: (a) you should believe it, and (b) you should
do something about it.  The "something" here is another booster, and that's the
proposition before the FDA now.  

The Moderna press release is significantly briefer, but mentions that it's also based
largely on the Israeli data, which we presume to be the same as the datasets Pfizer so
conveniently cited.  We'll look forward to reviewing everybody's data, if the FDA holds
VRBPAC hearings, which are always public.  

The
[FDA advisory committees calendar](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar)
does not yet have a VRBPAC meeting scheduled for either booster application (as of
2022-Mar-18).  But they've recently made decisions &ndash; for example, approving evusheld
&ndash; without convening a VRBPAC meeting.  So maybe that will happen here?  But now you
can use the link above to keep an eye on the VRBPAC calendar yourself, as we will be doing
here at Chez Weekend.  

Either way, if the FDA decides to grant EUA to another booster, the CDC will still have to
pass on it.  That's likely, but not guaranteed.  

We note, with some faint air of impatience, that Omicron-specific vaccines from both
sources are still in trials.  While I'm happy &ndash; and more than that, really &ndash;
to take another booster, it's the Omicron-specific booster that I _really_ want.  (At
least, until the &pi; variant, or whatever we call it, heaven help us.)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Sadly, we've failed to learn some important lessons of the pandemic, preferring to learn to
tolerate right-wing political posturing and disinformation instead.  _That's the bad news._  

Happily, we've learned to make _awesomely_ high efficacy vaccines, and we're on course to
boost either with the base vaccine or with an Omicron-specific vaccine.  _That's the good news._
