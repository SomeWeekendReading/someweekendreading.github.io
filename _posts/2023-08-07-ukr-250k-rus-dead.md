Sometimes the news is so inevitable and sad that all we can do is bear witness and mourn.  


## Russian Deaths in the Invasion of Ukraine  

It seems, unintentionally, we've been writing quite a bit about the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR).  These have been over
a bit of a wide range in tone:  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-08-07-ukr-250k-rus-dead-ukrmod-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-08-07-ukr-250k-rus-dead-ukrmod-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="651" alt="Ukrainian MoD @ Twitter: 250k Russian dead as of 2023-Aug-07" title="Ukrainian MoD @ Twitter: 250k Russian dead as of 2023-Aug-07" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Dress standards for Zelensky among the diplomatic suits <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
  and a peculiar memory of Tacitus to interpret Ukraine. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  
- Some advice to disengage from doomscrolling by a psychotherapist <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>,
  and some refreshingly sensitive and good-spirited advice to "do better", from Arnold
  Schwarzenegger. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  
- We've also looked at the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine's Twitter/X feed on casualties,
  and found it generally reasonable (i.e., in the middle of the pack of estimates by other
  sources).  Regression analysis shows a peculiarly linear trend in casualties, and a time
  structure in Russian missiles that may have to do with their supply
  chains. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>
  <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup> <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>
  <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>  

Today's data snapshot from the Ukr MoD is shown here: a quarter of a million of Russian
lives lost.  

You can debate the accuracy of the Ukrainian data, but as we've investigated before, they
are neither the highest nor the lowest estimates, and seem to be done by hand counting at
each battle.  I have no idea how close to the unknowable reality they are, but they're
about the best a reasonable person on-site can do.  

We also note that the rates have stepped up: 500 more Russian dead _every day_, as well as
high numbers of drones and cruise missiles.  From the former we learn that Russian field
commanders have not gone beyond human wave tactics; from the latter we learn that their
higher-ups have decided to try remote warfare.  

Still: 250,000 dead in just about a year and a half.  

The mind boggles at the brutality of Russia: not only in things like bombing blood
transfusion centers, schools, and cathedrals, but also the brutality with which they treat
their own soldiers.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Honestly, I dunno what to tell ya.  

This is madness, but it is the _opposite_ of the
[Divine Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_madness).  

Even in a world of [_realpolitik_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik), it doesn't
make sense in terms of the sheer cruelty and stupidity Russia is exhibiting.  

Very, very [_некультурный_](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nekulturny)!
