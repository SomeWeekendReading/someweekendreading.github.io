We members of the Nerd Tribe like our little jokes.  The more obscure, requiring loads of
intellectual context, the better.  The DNS system is taking this one step further.  


## Dr Horrible's Sing-Along Blog  

[Joss Whedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon) was, in the 90s through about
2010, the _enfant terrible_ of nerdy, fantasy popular culture with a strong feminist mix.
He's subsequently been 'canceled'. That's probably for good reason, involving sexual
harassment and generally being an emotionally cruel jerk to his colleagues.  

Still&hellip; is this meant to be a life sentence?  Can we, at some point, begin
discussing the art again even while separating it from the artist?  I have no idea what
the answer to that question should be.  I just know I miss the art.

During a 2008 writer's strike, while the studios were pretty much shut down, Whedon and
his friends and colleagues made a well-regarded [_samizdat_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat)
superhero musical miniseries called
[Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Horrible%27s_Sing-Along_Blog).
The premise is absurd, of course, Whedon being a self-described existentialist and
absurdist:  
- In this world, there are people with superpowers.  Some of them are heroes, and some are
  villains.  
- They have silly hero names, like
  ["Captain Hammer"](https://drhorrible.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Hammer),
  ["Dr. Horrible"](https://drhorrible.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Horrible), and even
  ["Moist"](https://drhorrible.fandom.com/wiki/Moist).  
- The story follows the aspiring villain, Dr. Horrible, who seeks to make the bad-guy
  big-time by being accepted into the bad-guy union, the
  [Evil League of Evil](https://drhorrible.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_League_of_Evil).  (Motto:
  "Homines Non Boni Seriose", or "Serious Bad Guys" in dog-Latin.)   
- The head of the Evil League of Evil is a supreme bad-guy with the sobriquet
  ["Bad Horse"](https://drhorrible.fandom.com/wiki/Bad_Horse).  This _nom de mal_ is
  apparently quite literal, as he is an actual horse, presumably bad.  We don't know _why_ he is
  so imposing, except that everyone else fears him.

There is a song in which Dr. Horrible has sent a letter of application to the Evil League
of Evil, and gets a reply from Bad Horse, sung inexplicably by a cowboy chorus:  
> Bad Horse  
> Bad Horse  
> Bad Horse  
> Bad Horse  
>   
> He rides across the nation  
> The thoroughbred of sin  
> He got the application  
> That you just sent in  
>   
> It needs evaluation  
> So let the games begin  
> A heinous crime, a show of force  
> A murder would be nice of course  
>   
> Bad Horse  
> Bad Horse  
> Bad Horse  
> He’s Bad  
>   
> The Evil League of Evil  
> Is watching so beware  
> The grade that you receive  
> Will be your last we swear  
>   
> So make the Bad Horse gleeful  
> Or he’ll make you his mare...  
>   
> You’re saddled up  
> There’s no recourse  
> It’s Hi-Ho Silver  
> Signed, Bad Horse  

By the standards of the Nerd Tribe, this is all quite normal.  Gloriously funny and full
of self-directed sarcasm, but normal.  Someone even registered the host 
[`bad.horse`](https://www.bad.horse/) on the internet, which will play the song for you.
Still normal.  

The point where it veers &ndash; ever so _slightly_ &ndash; away from normal is when the
song got encoded into the internet's Domain Name System.  DNS, for those of you who are
not networking cognoscenti, is a system which _inter alia_ maps host names like `yahoo.com` to
numerical IP addresses that can be used for routing.  This is a peculiar place to bury a
joke, since it will likely not be exhumed for generations.  

Well, that last bit is false.  A number of wags have pointed this out, and your humble
Weekend Editor is apparently the last to know, as per usual practice.  But now that I
know, here's the evidence: if you use `traceroute` to examine the hosts in the path from
your computer to `bad.horse`, the intervening hosts spell out the lyrics of the song:  

```

Amusingly, it doesn't work nearly as well with a VPN.  Like so many absurd sites nowadays,
in the name of "security" &ndash; theirs, not yours &ndash; you are required to drop trousers
and run naked upon the internet.  _Sigh_.  

## The Weekend Conclusion  

The sheer amount of effort to perpetrate this joke is mind-boggling; registering that many
hosts alone is daunting.  The fact that some in very odd domain names like "mare" gives
one further pause for thought.  

The burial of this joke in the DNS should have this so thoroughly obscured it that it would
not be found for generations, whereupon it would take sociologists and historians a while
to discover the source of the joke.  

I'd have placed a strong bet on "never" as the discovery date.  

I would have been wrong.  More or less everybody knows.  And now I know.  And so too, do you.  

I wonder what other jokes are buried in the DNS?

Nope.
