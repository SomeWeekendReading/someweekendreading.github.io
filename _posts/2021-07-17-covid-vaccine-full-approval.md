[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) a couple days ago why the
Pfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J vaccines don't have full FDA approval.  Umm&hellip; hmm.
Good question.  


## Vaccine Hesitancy: Willful Resistance, Deliberate Ignorance  

It's bad out there.  Really bad.  _Big_ fractions of the population are infected with Republican
partisanship, one of whose symptoms seems to be to act willfully against one's own self-interest.

Even prominent Republicans are finally, reluctantly coming to this conclusion.  For
example, David Frum.  Now normally, I have no patience whatsoever with his sort of
intellectual anti-intellectual pose.  But Republicans, generally, adore him.  So it's
important that even he is now saying vaccine resistance seems to be deliberate,
self-inflicted sabotage:

_Preventable.  Willful._  Remember that, and do better.  

Others are just plain crazy.  They myth of the tracking/birth control chip just won't die:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    &quot;A fifth of Americans believe that it is &#39;very true&#39; or &#39;probably true&#39; that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#COVID19</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vaccines?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#vaccines</a> contain microchips as part of a covert government-led population control plan.&quot;<br><br>

Really?  A tracking chip for _birth control?_ I know Republicans seem to hate birth
control and seemingly avoid learning anything about it, but we already know how to do birth control.
And _this isn't how it works._  Also, as we've 
[previously written on this crummy little blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/variants-vs-vaccines#what-about-vaccine-resistance), 
[actual tracking chips for pets](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/variants-vs-vaccines/) don't
work that way either:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    For a bit more context: microchip needle on the left, vaccine needle in the right. 
    I promise you'd notice if the government were secretly microchipping you.

## The "Experimental" Excuse  

Lots of people say the vaccines are "experimental", and they won't let the government
experiment on them.  Deep sigh.  

First, the "E" in "EUA" stands for "EMERGENCY Use Authorization", not experimental.  The
experimental part has been done: that was the research work in early 2020, followed by the
clinical trials in late 2020, and then the FDA Emergency Use Authorization in December 2021.
That part's done, with full and eager consent of the participants.  COVID-19 is an
_emergency_, and the fast approval of vaccines is a response to that.  

Second, there is a (minor) point to be made here: why aren't the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna,
and J&amp;J vaccines fully approved yet?  We've just run the largest Phase IV
(post-approval) clinical trial _in human history_, on _more than a billion subjects_
world-wide.  Isn't that enough for full approval?  Given at least some of the willful
resistance to vaccines hinges on the current partial approval, wouldn't it be prudent
public health policy to push for full approval of all 3 vaccines ASAP at least in the
United States?  (Other countries, of course, have other processes.)

Here at Chez Weekend we think so.  

That's why we were gratified to see progress, albeit _glacially slow_ progress, on full
approval of at least the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine reported by 
_Reuters_. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

The meeting for full approval will happen at least by 2022-Jan, though the article notes
that it is likely to happen sooner than that, according to Janet Woodcock, the acting FDA
Commissioner.  They do note specifically that full approval might help ease vaccine
hesitancy; what I don't quite get is why they're being _so slow_ about it.  After all,
[about 85 million Americans have now been fuly vaccinated with Pfizer](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations)
as of this writing, so what exactly do we need in the way of more data?!  

The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna applications for full approval have been at the FDA for
months now:  
- Pfizer reported that they had submitted their application for full approval in
  2021-May.  It's hard to wrap my head around what exactly the FDA needs to do to check
  the scientific details in this application that might take until next January.  Surely,
  given the resources of the FDA, they could have checked out every little detail by June
  or July, i.e., _now_?  
- Similarly, Moderna reports that they filed for full approval in early 2021-June.  It's now
  mid-July, so why are there not hearings being held after FDA internal scientific review
  on that too?  
  
(We can _sort of_ understand why full approval of Pfizer/BioNTech on 12-16 year olds hasn't
happened yet, since there's not yet 6 months of safety data on the teenage group.)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

So something's a little weird here:
- The applications are submitted, with gigantic amounts of data to back them up, more than
  we've had for any other vaccine in human history.  
- The FDA officially recognizes, in the statement of the acting Commissioner, that full
  approval is an important tool to mitigate the maddening public health problem of vaccine
  hesitancy.  
- And yet, the Pfizer/BioNTech meeting is now tenatively scheduled for 8 months after
  submission of the application, and the Moderna meeting hasn't even been scheduled?  
  
Clearly something is wrong.  Most likely hypothesis: there's something in the full
approval process I don't understand, and am not allowing for proper time to handle that
unknown thing.  

But I wish I knew what it was&hellip;
