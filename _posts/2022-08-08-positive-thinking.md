People are _always_ telling me to "think positive".  I hate it.


## Positive thinking?!  

I _really_ hate being told that.  It's as though I'm being socially coerced to buy into
some collective delusion that lets NT's ignore how terribly we're all being exploited by the
rich and their corporations.  Or how brutal we are to each other.  

We [depressed, anxious folk are more realistic in our assessments of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depressive_realism), don't you know?  


## COVID-19 testing  

Still&hellip; it's time to test to see if I've cleared the rebound infection.  Maybe, if I
"think positive[ly]", as all the NT's endlessly chant, I can be released from confinement
on the 2nd floor?

Behold the fruits of positive thinking: I am indeed, still positive.  _COVID-19 positive._  

Ok, only a little bit.  But with RAT sensitivity, it means I'm still likely shedding
virus.  And that's positive enough to warrant further confinement.  

But&hellip; today is the 5th day of rebound COVID-19 (no 2nd course of paxlovid,
irritatingly enough).  Symptoms are fading: no fever, most of the aches &amp; pains faded,
no long sessions of productive coughing.  Still some productive coughing/runny nose,
sudden sweats, and fatigue.  And a RAT producing that _glaarrgh_ red T line.  


## So what now?  

Back to books &amp; YouTube for now.

I'm re-reading some of my old SF paperbacks that happen to be covering most of the the
walls of the tatami room upstairs here.
[Dean Ing's _Anasazi_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/602931.Anasazi)
was pleasantly chilling, and now I'm trying to figure out
[Paul McCauley's _Eternal Light_](https://www.publishersweekly.com/9780688127572).  Some
of the old books from the 1970s and 1980s haven't worn well, culturally speaking, and
require one to re-enter the cultural frame of memory to understand them.  Others are
more&hellip; universal.  No idea how to predict _ab initio_ which would have become
which.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-08-positive-thinking-coleman-relativity.jpg" width="200" height="289" alt="Sidney Coleman, Relativity" title="Sidney Coleman, Relativity" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
In a more serious vein, I've been working my way through
[Sidney Coleman's _Lectures on Relativity_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59143228-sidney-coleman-s-lectures-on-relativity).
It's about as good as you'd expect, if you knew Coleman: almost _startlingly_ clear, with
his lecture style that makes the world suddenly make sense.  It's like an ambush of
clarity: you can't see it coming, but every time it clobbers you from behind it's pure joy
of insight.  

I miss him.  I modeled a lot of my own teaching technique after him (and a couple others,
but maybe 50% El Sid).  That picture of him on the cover, slouched in a recliner, is
perfect.  I was really sad one day to learn that he didn't much like teaching, even though
he was an excellent and hilarious experience in the classroom.  I wanted the fiction that
because he made me happy, surely he must be happy doing so.  I guess it was a duty for
him.  

But I still respect dutifulness, and miss him anyway.  

As far as YouTubers&hellip; Let me begin with how amused I am at the word "YouTuber".  It
sounds like some arcane epithet to be hurled when one wishes to compare one's antagonist
to a potato.  (Go ahead, think it through.  The rest of us will wait.)  

I've been feeling confined, helpless, and dependent with this idiot virus from the
unmasked idiots who gave it to me on the idiotically crowded, slow MBTA shuttle bus.  So
I've been fascinated with independence.  Hence the videos of people building off-grid
cabins and rather more elaborate off-grid workshops and homes:

- [_Bush Radical_](https://www.youtube.com/c/Bushradical) and 
  [_Girl in the Woods_](https://www.youtube.com/c/alaskagirlinthewoods1), a married
  couple, seem to like to spend their time building fairly minimalist cabins and outhouses
  on some tracts of properties they own in Alaska and upper Michigan.  
  
  Sometimes they stray near right-wing prepper territory, which just makes me itch with
  revulsion.  But mostly, they show how to build rather nice little cabins to which you
  can retire to build a fire in a wood stove and get some writing done on a winter day.  

  And they play with their dogs a lot, who seem insanely happy canines, just a joy to behold.  
  
  When they cook over a wood fire or on the wood stove, they always "offer you the first
  bite", holding a forkful close to the camera lens.  Some of the "spend the night with me
  at the cabin in a blizzard" videos are deeply reassuring to me in some way.  Probably
  something to do with feeling secure.  
  
  And&hellip; they just seem _happy_ with their lives.  
  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-08-positive-thinking-ambition-strikes.jpg" width="400" height="146" alt="Ambition Strikes @ YouTube" title="Ambition Strikes @ YouTube" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">  
- [_Ambition Strikes_](https://www.youtube.com/c/AmbitionStrikes) is another married
  couple who apparently met in college repairing off-road vehicles.  "Wedding" vs
  "welding" &hellip; I mean, it's only 1 letter different, right?  
  
  These guys take the opposite tack from the more minimalist pair above: they buy whatever
  tech they need, up to and including bulldozers and surplus army trucks.  I got hooked
  watching them
  [build a ridiculously over-sized solar array](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMCvRxq4QdcfslNW2kiSkqoUIZZyIsS7F)
  for their off-grid workshop/apartment in northern Idaho.  Yes, it's oversized by
  conventional calculations, but on the other hand they'll never have to worry
  about utilities ever again.  They're buying not just electrical production, but also
  security.  
  
  Their financial management is interesting too, since it's all done on a cash basis.
  They own stuff, and don't have loans to pay off.  Again, security.  

So that's my somewhat deranged COVID-19 isolation time.  

No more deranged than usual, really.  

(Or possibly I'm too deranged to tell.  Feel free to debug my state of derangement in the
comments, if you like.)
