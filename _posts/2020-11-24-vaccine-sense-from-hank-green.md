[Hank Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Green) (notable web producer, author, and
master of miscellany) recorded his weekly vlog to his brother about whether he would take
a COVID vaccine.  Roughly: "oh hell yeah!" (though far more entertainingly).

If you like this sort of smart &amp; gentle snark, then you would enjoy 
[vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGaVdbSav8xWuFWTadK6loA), 
a series of 2 videos/week that he and his brother have been exchanging for more
than a decade now.  While it's full of sillly pop culture trivia, it's also 2 quite
observant public intellectuals exploring the deep weirdness of the world in a 
quite informed and funny way.
