[Hank Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Green) (notable web producer, author, and
master of miscellany) recorded his weekly vlog to his brother about whether he would take
a COVID vaccine.  Roughly: "oh hell yes!", though far more entertainingly.

If you like this sort of smart &amp; gentle snark, then you would enjoy

a series of 2 videos/week that he and his brother have been exchanging for more
than a decade now.
