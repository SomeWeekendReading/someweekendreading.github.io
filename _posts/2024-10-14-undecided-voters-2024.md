So&hellip; if you're a US voter, are you _undecided_ about the election?!  


## Really?!  

Ok, this is a screed.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-14-undecided-voters-wiley.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-14-undecided-voters-wiley-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="149" alt="Cartoon by Wiley Miller: up or down, undecided is a trap" title="Cartoon by Wiley Miller: up or down, undecided is a trap" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
I was wondering who these much-vaunted "undecided" voters could be, when someone called to
my attention this cartoon from yesterday by [Wiley Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiley_Miller).  
- You can push the up button, and the elevator will take you up.  
- You can push the down button, and the elevator will take you down.  
- Or you can push the "undecided" button&hellip; the trap door opens, and who knows what
  becomes of you?  
  
This is like my feelings about US "undecided" voters, _especially_ if they are among the
10,000 or so voters in the swing states who will decide the future of American democracy.

Look, it's not hard:  
- __If you want democracy,__ then vote Harris/Walz at the top of the ticket, and Democrats
  all the way down to ensure a functional Senate and House, not filled with Republican
  nihilists.  
- __If you want fascism,__ then I despise you, but your choice is clear.  
- __If you fail to vote,__ the only "message" you're sending is "I don't care and you can
  ignore me and my interests".  That's a stupid message, so don't do that.  
- __If you vote 3rd party,__ the only "message" you're sending is "I am bad at math."
  Yes, it would be better if we had a proportional representation system, or
  rank-preference voting, or something other than first-past-the post.  But FPTP is what's
  _here_, what's _real_, and what's the only thing for you to deal with.  So don't be
  stupid this way, either.  
  
So, look: just vote for Democrats this time.  There will come a time for more nuanced
partisanship, and hectoring the elected to do better.  But that time is not now.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Glaaah.  I want this _over._  

But "over" in the right way: Harris/Walz elected, having gotten past all the mischief
points where Trump will surely try to blow up the system again, Trump back in court for
sentencing and incarceration.

Nope.
