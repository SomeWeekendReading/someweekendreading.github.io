In the Gilded Age of the late 19th century in the US, the &uuml;ber-wealthy had a tendency
to corner markets in commodities, to extract higher prices for themselves.  Surely we're
not doing that any more are we? &hellip; Surely?  


## The Bad Old Days  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-07-cornering-markets-wikipedia-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-07-cornering-markets-wikipedia-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="310" alt="Wikipedia: Horizontal and vertical monopolies" title="Wikipedia: Horizontal and vertical monopolies" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Monopolies come in 2 kinds, broadly speaking: horizontal and vertical.  (We're glossing
over _mountains_ of detail, but this is as good a place as any to start.)  

The Wikipedia explainers on [vertical monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration)
and [horizontal monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_integration) are
pretty good; the diagram at the right comes from those articles.  It depicts, as an example,
the phases of automobile manufacturing, distribution, and usage vertically.  Horizontally are
different companies that engage in each of those phases.  

A vertical monopoly is a company that attempts to control a column, while a horizontal
monopoly attempts to control a row:  
- A __vertical monopoly__ is where 1 company tries to be a controlling force in each of the
  rows, i.e., building itself along the entire column in the figure.  

  It manufactures, distributes, sells, services, and garages cars in this example.
  This gives them opportunity for lock-ins: their cars take only their gas, their garages
  accept only their cars, their mechanics work only on their cars, their manufacturing
  workers and engineers are encumbered by non-disclosures to work only on their products,
  etc.
  
  Carnegie Steel would be an example from the 19th century: they owned iron mines, they
  owned coal mines, they owned coke ovens, they owned railroads, they owned steel plants,
  and so on.  This led to a furious level of integration that let them control costs, but
  at the expense of extracting monopoly profits from the markets and driving out
  competition.  
  
  Standard Oil was another such example in the 19th century: petroleum extraction,
  transport, refinement, and wholesale distribution were all under their control.  
  
- A __horizontal monopoly__ is when a corporation builds itself along a row in the figure,
  e.g., basically controlling all the production in one step of the manufacture of cars.
  
  If you control all the railroads, then you can make the steel companies pay you
  exorbitant fees to transport their coal, iron ore, and steel.  

  There are numerous such examples in the US now, such as airlines, pharmaceuticals, meat
  packing, telecommunications, entertainment, and so on.  Each of those is controlled by a
  very small number of companies, with cross-agreements among the competitors.  
  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-07-cornering-markets-qje-1.jpg" width="400" height="310" alt="Goldin &amp; Margo @ QJE: The Great Compression" title="Goldin &amp; Margo @ QJE: The Great Compression" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
This caused all sorts of havoc in the late 19th century and the early 20th: periodic
economic panics and depressions, mind-boggling inequality, political corruption in the
service of the wealthy, and so on.  It was fixed (mostly) over a period of decades, with
anti-monopoly laws like the
[Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act), 
progressive taxation in the 1930s, banking regulation, and so on.  This lead to what economists
Claudia Goldin &amp; Robert Margo called
[the mid-20th century "Great Compression"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Compression)
in a 1992 paper (riffing off the term "Great Depression"). <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  
Inequality shrank dramatically, banking was stabilized with FDIC guarantees and the
[Glass-Steagall acts of 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass%E2%80%93Steagall_legislation) 
to control their risk taking, the Federal Reserve could moderate
economic downturns, and so on.  This led to a period of stable growth.  


## The Bad Nowadays  

Then we repealed all that, or let conservative Supreme Courts pick away at it until it was
neutered, or at least declined to enforce it.  (Similarly to the way we've allowed civil
rights and voting rights to wither.)  

And now we're back to the Gilded Age: by the 
[Gini coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient), which measures
inequality, we're in a second Gilded Age.  We should expect monopolies, panics, economic
collapses, and political corruption.  So&hellip; here we are:
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-07-cornering-markets-cepr-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-07-cornering-markets-cepr-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Williamson &amp; Lindert @ CEPR: Gini coefficient of US since 1700" title="Williamson &amp; Lindert @ CEPR: Gini coefficient of US since 1700" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- According Williamson &amp; Lindert, writing for the Centre for Economic Policy Research 
  (CEPR) <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, American growth and inequality since 1700 show
  we are now at the inequality peaks of the first Gilded Age.  

  Here we reproduce their Figure 2, which has the goods.  Note that the US was always a
  pretty unequal place, with an _extraordinary_ interlude from 1940-1980.  The post-WWII
  tax reforms and opened access to education (though sadly excluding most minorities and
  women), produced the "Great Compression" we cited via Goldin &amp; Margo above.  
  
  Here it's clear: beginning around Reagan, we began re-imposing the mechanisms of
  inequality with huge tax cuts for the wealthy, benefit cuts for the poor, and massive
  corporate welfare.  
  
  We are now, _by the numbers,_ in a Second Gilded Age.

- As former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Obama economic advisor,
  Harvard/Brandeis/Berkeley professor has recently reminded us <sup
  id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>: now the pay gap between workers and CEOs is 351-to-1 vs
  21-to-1 in 1965.  

  One reason wages can't go up is because _all_ the increased profits from increased
  productivity have gone to the top.  
  
  (Reich proposes an additional corporate tax based on the CEO to (median?) worker ratio.
  While sensible, that, of course, will have to wait for the return of a degree of sanity
  to US politics.)

- Not enough for you?  How about the Roman Empire?  

  Scheidel &amp; Friesen, writing in the _Journal of Roman Studies_ in 
  2009 <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, go through all the elaborate details to estimate
  the Gini coefficient for various phases of the Roman empire.  Their conclusion (bottom
  of p. 86): 0.42 - 0.44.  
  
  Note this very carefully: with the US at a Gini coefficient of around 0.5,
  _we are now more unequal than the Roman empire, with its &uuml;ber-wealthy aristocrats
  vs its slaves._  

We've also declined to enforce anti-monopoly laws in any meaningful sense.  (And now, it
appears that having a Trump associate involved, or paying a bribe to Trump, is a
pre-requisite for getting mergers approved.)

Here are some examples of how _badly_ concentrated industries in the US have become in the
last 40 or so years since Reagan.  They show the tree of corporate mergers leading to just
a few behemoths left today.  (Click to embiggen any of these pictures.)  
- Defense contractors (upper left) have collapsed from 75 companies to just 5.  
- Airlines (upper right) have collapsed from 34 carriers to 5.  
- Pharmaceuticals have done something similar.  Here we show the corporate ancestries of
  Pfizer (combining 52 companies into 1 giant), and Sanofi (combining 18 companies into 1 giant).  
  (Note that Sanofi is largely European; corporate mergers to form oligopolies is a
  phenomenon common in most of the developed world.  Hence, so also is revenant fascism.)  
- Finally, at the bottom, we show how American banking became so concentrated: 37 banks
  became just 4 "too big to fail" banks that have their tendrils into _everything._  This
  is also why I've had 5 separate banks since coming to MIT as a grad student, despite
  never changing my account: the banks just kept eating each other!  

These are _huge_ concentrations of corporate power.  With the ability of corporations to
donate to political campaigns, particularly soft money and dark money, they are
concentrations of political power as well.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-07-cornering-markets-wikipedia-2.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-07-cornering-markets-wikipedia-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="260" alt="Wikipedia: Manipulation of silver market prices by the Hunt brothers, culminating in Silver Thursday" title="Wikipedia: Manipulation of silver market prices by the Hunt brothers, culminating in Silver Thursday" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
It's not just corporations that seek to monopolize things.  

An example that stuck in my youthful memory was from 1980, when the Hunt brothers attempted
to corner the world silver markets, leading to 
[Silver Thursday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Thursday) on
1980-Mar-27 <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>.  With the
Iran hostage crisis in full flare, the prices of gold and silver climbed as investors
worried about war.  The billionaire Hunt brothers sought to control substantially _all_
the silver on the world markets, with a series of leveraged commodity moves.  

At one point in 1979, they apparently controlled over 100 million troy ounces of silver,
about 1/3 of the world's silver not held by governments.  

This caused a collapse and commodity market panics, which had to be bailed out by a
consortium of banks.  (__NB:__ They provided a bailout _to the Hunt brothers,_ not to people who
were damaged by their monopoly.)  If that had not happened, a number of brokerages and
banks might have collapsed, having lent money to the Hunt brothers for their boondoggle.  

This is what happens when we allow too much concentration of wealth and power, with little
meaningful restraint: they will attempt to achieve complete control, and will require
massive bailouts when they fail.  

This is what "privatize the profits, socialize the losses" means.  It should have been
obvious in 1980, but here we are, 46 years later, still avoiding the lesson.  


## &hellip; And Now, Today's Outrage du Jour  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-07-cornering-markets-moores-1.jpg" width="400" height="124" alt="'Tom' @ Moore's Law is Dead: Sam Altman cornering markets in ram and Si wafers" title="'Tom' @ Moore's Law is Dead: Sam Altman cornering markets in ram and Si wafers" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BORRBce5TGw?si=Hg7liWfygzAFjOaX" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
So it should come as no surprise that our modern oligarchs pursue the same strategy.

While I'm familiar with "Moore's Law is dead" as a (mildly questionable) saying, I haven't
read the blog of that name.  But they've reported an important story on their blog and
their YouTube channel that I haven't seen much in the traditional
media. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  

Just as the Hunt brothers spiked the price of silver, the writers noticed a 156% jump in
DRAM over a period of about 3 weeks.  It's enough that the DRAM alone would cost more than
the whole computer did before the price jump.  DRAM is, indeed, becoming almost
unobtainable.  Apparently several DRAM manufacturers have contacted wholesalers and
retailers, to see if they could _buy back inventory._  

Their analysis:  
> So what happened?  Well, it all comes down to three perfectly synergistic events:  
> 1. OpenAI executed two unprecedented RAM deals that took everyone by surprise.  
> 2. The secrecy and size of the deals triggered full-scale panic buying from everyone
>    else.  
> 3. The market had almost zero safety stock left due to tariffs, worry about decreasing
>    RAM prices over the summer, and stalled equipment transfers.  

Apparently OpenAI signed deals with Samsung and SK Hynix &ndash; with near simultaneity
&ndash; to acquire 40% of the world's DRAM supply for themselves alone.  They even managed
to keep Samsung and SK Hynix from knowing about each other's deals, to prevent them from
going up in price.  

Add to that the tariff chaos, and you have a situation where the DRAM manufacturers had no
slack inventory _at all._  

And the weirdest part: they're buying uncut, unfinished wafers.  They'll apparently be
stockpiled, either to be finished into usable modules later, or just to cut supplies to
competitors else _now._  Manufacturers are now quoting 13 month lead times on memory.  

That makes it look like OpenAI isn't just defending their own supply of memory, but
attempting to choke the market to cut off anybody else.  There are reports that OpenAI is
attempting to buy up the DRAM manufacturing equipment as well, to
_deny future manufacturing capability._  

This is a _classic_ monopolist's move!  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Look, billionaires are just no good.  We should tax them down to, say, \$100 million each,
maybe?  

We remind everyone of screenwriter [John Rogers's 3rd Rule of Crime](https://buttondown.com/kungfumonkey/archive/cons-heists-101-orientation/#:~:text=Rule%203%3A%20Nothing%20ever%20stops%20until%20a%20Rich%20White%20Guy%20goes%20to%20jail):  
> Rule 3: Nothing ever stops until a Rich White Guy goes to jail.  

That's the _moderate_ solution.  The other solutions probably involve tumbrels.

## Addendum 2025-Dec-15: Historian Heather Cox Richardson Explains it All

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHgOYW8_Jow?si=qzdY_mNW-KRBPwu1" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
I try to listen to American historian
[Heather Cox Richardson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heather_Cox_Richardson) on an
regular basis.  Her [_Letters from an American_](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com/)
is worth checking frequently.  I also like her _YouTube_ videos, if only to hear her calm
voice, explaining the horribly fascist reality of American politics at the moment.  

This video is an excellent example, showing how relatively lower income inequality in the
mid-20th century was a departure from the _norm:_ the oligarchs think it is _normal_ that
they should rule.  She relates the variety of ways the "reactionary right" has tried to
reassert economic and political power, to undo the 20th century reforms and re-institute
their will as law.  It's all there: the racism, the xenophobia/deportation fever, the
moral panic over LGBTQ folk, the regressive tax cuts piling wealth into the top 1%, and so
on.  

Very woth 15 minutes of your time!
