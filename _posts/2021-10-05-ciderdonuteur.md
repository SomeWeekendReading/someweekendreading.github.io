Today I learned of a hero, engaged in a Great Work that is clearly a service to all
humanity.  Oh, and there were donuts, too.  


## Autumn in New England  

It is once again autumn in New England.  

[Like last year, we made a pilgrimage to the Berkshires]({{ site.baseurl
}}/in-autumn-in-new-england-thoughts-turn-to/).  We stayed at the same friends' house,
this time with them in residence.  We didn't take many pictures.  However, as we were all
fully vaccinated and religious about mask use, we managed to keep company with some good
friends this time.  Mostly we cooked, and talked, and enjoyed the beautiful views.  

It's too early for foliage season, but as it's apple season, it is also _cider donut season._  

And here at Chez Weekend: cider, donuts, and especially _cider donuts_ are serious business.  


## M. Ciderdonuteur

From the paper copy of the venerable _Globe_ today comes the story of a heroic man,
engaged in a Great Work. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> Alex Schwartz (of Cambridge, of
course) has made it his rather intense hobby to sample _every_ cider donut sold at an
orchard or farm store in New England.  And people have noticed, e.g., 
_Boston Magazine_. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>

Last year he cataloged the pleasures of 30 orchards and farm stands.  He has the attitude
you migth expect toward packaged donuts at the grocery store, or apple cider donut
flavored Oreos ("filling tastes like a candle"), or other abominations of that sort.
(Don't even get me started about Dunkin'.) Clearly, his soul is pure.

His Instagram account, [@ciderdonuteur](https://www.instagram.com/ciderdonuteur/?hl=en)
<sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, catalogs both the beauty of New England and a bit of
food critique of each item sampled.  He's also created a cider donut map of New England,
which people use to plan day trips.  It currently has 191 spots, each in the process of being
reviewed for the 2021 season.

Last year's winner (and this year's front-runner) was 
[Russell Orchards of Ipswich](https://www.russellorchards.com/en/bakery/donuts.php), up on
Cape Ann.  Now I have to see about persuading the Weekend Editrix into an autumnal
sightseeing drive that _just so happens_ to go through the noble environs of Ipswich.  

And I wonder if M. Ciderdonuteur needs an intern?  I could do statistics for him, in
exchange for tagging along on a couple donut safaris&hellip; in my dreams.
