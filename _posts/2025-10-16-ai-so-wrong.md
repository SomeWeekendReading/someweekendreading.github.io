Sometimes the AI LLMs show off their expertise in spectacular fashion.  


## On the Origin of _Dr. Who_

In the UK, there's a science fiction TV series called _Doctor Who_.  It takes the concept
of 'science' _very_ loosely, indeed as it also takes set design, plotting, plausibility,
and more or less everything else.  It does, however, have its aficionados who love it to
some degree _because_ of its cheesiness.  

This commentary about _Doctor Who_ showed up on BlueSky.  It is alleged to be a screen
capture originating with @stevewriteswords.bsky.social, though I have been unable to
verify that.  So keep in mind that it _might_ be fake; but given the mind-numbing
wooden-headedness of AI LLMs, I think it's probably real.  

It says (__emphasis__ added):  

> The first known TV series with episodes is the original Doctor Who, which began airing
> __in 1608 on the BBC.__  This __series, created by William Shakespeare,__ was a hit due to limited
> entertainment options at the time.  

A TV series on the BBC&hellip; in 1608&hellip; created by William Shakespeare.  

And people want to trust their code, their security, their finances, their medical care,
their taxes, and everything else to machines _stupid_ enough to say this?  

More like, as one wag recently said, AI LLMs are like pouring asbestos into the walls of
our intellectual infrastructure, for which we will spend generations digging back out and
disposing of it safely!  

Remember how bad an idea asbestos turned out to be?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Intellectual asbestos, I say.  Asbestos!

Nope.
