[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe), "What's your retirement plan?"  

Why, to retire in the classical style, of course:  
>__Otio qui nescit uti__  
>__plus negotii habet quam cum est negotium in negotio;__  
>nam cui quod agat institutum est non ullo negotio  
>id agit, id studet, ibi mentem atque animum delectat suum:  
>otioso in otio animus nescit quid velit  
>Hoc idem est; em neque domi nunc nos nec militiae sumus;  
>imus huc, hinc illuc; cum illuc ventum est, ire illinc lubet.  
>Incerte errat animus, praeterpropter vitam vivitur.  
  
>__He who does not know how to use leisure__  
>__has more of work than when there is work in work.__  
>For to whom a task has been set, he does the work,  
>desires it, and delights his own mind and intellect:  
>in leisure, a mind does not know what it wants.  
>The same is true (of us); we are neither at home nor in the battlefield;  
>we go here and there, and wherever there is a movement, we are there too.  
>The mind wanders unsure, except in that life is lived.  
&nbsp;&mdash; [Quintus Ennius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ennius "Quintus Ennius"), [_Iphigenia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia "Iphegenia")<sup id="fn1a">[[1](#fn1)]</sup>, 241–248, ca 190BCE  

The idea, of course, is to retire in the style of lines 241-242 and not the rest of it:
have a plethora of satisfying, productive activities instead of the mad scramble of
employment -- what [Wikipedia's "Otium" entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otium "Otium")
describes as "otium negotiosum".  

It may be that this blog will be a mad scramble of its own; it may be that it will be a satisfying, productive activity.  (["It may be that the gulfs shall wash us down... It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles"](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45392/ulysses%20Tennyson's%20_Ulysses_), as go the words Tennyson put in Ulysses' mouth upon his "retirement".)

There are, of course, other options, as one of my wonderful French colleagues pointed out
in Henri Salvador's brilliantly silly/sarcastic song, 
[_Le travail c'est la santé_](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_travail_c%27est_la_sant%C3%A9) 
from way back in 1965:  

My favorite part is the last verse, learned while playing pétanque chez Club Med:  
>Homm's d'affaires et meneurs de foule  
>Travaill'nt à en perdre la boule  
>Et meur'nt d'une maladie d'cœur  
>C'est très rare chez les pétanqueurs!  

(Of course, in these days of COVID-19, we all sing: "le _télé_ travail, c'est la santé!")
