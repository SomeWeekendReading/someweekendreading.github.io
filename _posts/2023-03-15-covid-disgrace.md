How has the US performed _vis &agrave; vis_ COVID-19?  Are we learning to do better?  

Alas&hellip; no.  No, we're not.  

As evidence, consider below (1) the state of public health measures world-wide,
(2) what the virus seems to be doing, and finally (3) what our _crazy_ reactions have been.  


## The state of the world  

Let's look at how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted human welfare, world-wide.  

The first question that interests me is: are we still living as long as before,
world-wide, or has COVID-19 made an appreciable impact on human longevity?  Staying alive
is, after all, one of the coarsest-grain measures of well-being.  

Alas, the evidence is, apparently not:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/CrabbBrendan/status/1632589642087436289"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-crabb-1.jpg" width="550" height="941" alt="Crabb @ Twitter: World-wide decline in expected lifespans" title="Crabb @ Twitter: World-wide decline in expected lifespans" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Here we're seeing the life expectancy at birth, stratified by region of the world, and
shown over the last 70 or so years.  A few facts stand out to me:  
1. The dip in all the curves starting around 2020 indicates that __the COVID-19 death toll
   has been large enough to make average human lifespans shorter__.  I was worried that this
   would be the case in the US but not other developed countries, due to our vaccine
   refusal rate and higher death rate per capita (see below): one of the COVID-19 death risk factors
   is being an American.  However, it appears to be a global effect, which is even worse.  
2. Then look at the disparity between regions of the world.  __Why did we build an economic
   and political system that shortens human lives by 15 years from the accident of birt of
   being an African?__  (And why do we continue to tolerate that?)  
3. Finally, compare the US and Europe.  They were broadly comparable in the 1990s, but
   then Europe made improvements which the US did not.  If we were to normalize lifespan
   by amount of healthcare spending, this would look even worse: __the US spends
   astronomically more on healthcare for lesser results__.  Our healthcare system is shot
   through with the rent-seeking middlemen that capitalism seems to spawn frequently.  

Via the indispensable Eric Topol, here is some evidence that the US has had the worst of the
global COVID-19 deaths per capita: 337 per 100k people.  That is significantly larger than
most of the rest of the world:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1626604300259713025"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-topol-1.jpg" width="550" height="717" alt="Topol @ Twitter: COVID-19 per capita deaths by country" title="Topol @ Twitter: COVID-19 per capita deaths by country" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Topol's point is that the US is at the top of the list, a position he describes
as ["ignominy"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ignominy).  Sadly, we agree.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-nyt-1.jpg" width="400" height="205" alt="Glanz, et al. @ NYT: How Deadly was China's COVID Wave?" title="Glanz, et al. @ NYT: How Deadly was China's COVID Wave?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-nyt-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-nyt-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Glanz, et al. @ NYT: Estimates of Chinese mortality vary widely" title="Glanz, et al. @ NYT: Estimates of Chinese mortality vary widely" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-nyt-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-nyt-3.jpg" width="400" height="351" alt="Glanz, et al. @ NYT: Somehow the real numbers got out for the latest wave?" title="Glanz, et al. @ NYT: Somehow the real numbers got out for the latest wave?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

But while we're checking his sources (which is part of what peer review is all about!) we
might wonder why China is called out in red, and why it has 2 different values?  

That's because his source is a _New York Times_ article. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
It tried to tease apart the puzzle of Chinese COVID-19 statistics, generally woefully
inaccurately reported by the Chinese government for political purposes.  They use
epidemiological models fit to other advanced countries to attempt an estimate of Chinese
death rates, given that funeral rates, deaths of prominent academics which are reported
internationally, and even crematoria lines are much bigger than would be
consistent with the Chinese official statistics:  

> After China relaxed the world's most stringent Covid-19 restrictions in December, the
> virus exploded. Hints of the surge were everywhere: Hospitals turned away
> patients. Crematories were overwhelmed with bodies. A wave of top scholars died.  
>  
> But China's official Covid death toll for the entire pandemic remains strikingly low:
> 83,150 people as of Feb. 9. __That number is a vast undercount__&hellip;  

As you can see in the 2nd graphic, if one employs epidemiological models (based either on
Shanghai where better numbers were available, or on travel patterns, or on the US death
rates) one gets a picture much different from the official one.  There should be 1.0 - 1.6
million dead, not just 83,150.  

Indeed, even if one looks only at the official Chinese data, shown in the 3rd graphic of
trailing 7 day death rate averages vs time, something fishy is going on.  We believe their
"COVID 0" policy probably did keep the numbers pretty low, but somehow the real data
appears to have leaked out in the January wave.  Either the high January data is wrong, or
the preceding low data is wrong.  They cannot both be right.  

__Conclusions:__  
- The US has terrible per-capita death rates, arguably the worst in the developed world.  
- The Chinese are consistently lying about their data, to no one's very great surprise.  
- Substantially all humanity has shorter average lifespans due to the COVID-19 deaths,
  with the effects of Long COVID-19 yet to be seen.  


## The state of the virus  

Ok, that's what the virus did to us in the past.  What's the virus doing now?  

<a href="https://twitter.com/Laurie_Garrett/status/1628444002356690947"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-prepub-garrett-1.jpg" width="550" height="655" alt="Garrett @ Twitter: All Omicron, all the time" title="Garrett @ Twitter: All Omicron, all the time" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Laurie Garrett reports that the excellent GISAID database of SARS-CoV2 sequences observed
in patients is all Omicron, all the time, all over the world.  For Jan-Feb 2023:  
- The pie charts at the top show 100% Omicron sequences all over the world.  
- The array at the bottom shows, for 4 weeks before 2023-Jan-24, all over the world
  Omicron was growing and everything else is pretty much extinct.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-cdc-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-cdc-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="405" alt="CDC nowcast: SARS-CoV2 variant abundances in the US 2022-Dec-14 to 2023-Mar-11" title="CDC nowcast: SARS-CoV2 variant abundances in the US 2022-Dec-14 to 2023-Mar-11" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
So we pretty much have to deal with Omicron, which is why we're glad here at Ch&acirc;teau
Weekend we got the bivalent classic/Omicron booster last fall.  There are a lot of Omicron
variants, but XBB1.5 seems to be the current terror.  We verified this using the
[US CDC's nowcast of variants](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-summary),
shown here.  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jz0PnV-PusA?start=1793" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
Yet here's a video segment from the _PBS News Hour_ broadcast of 2023-Feb-16, showing most
Americans simply _will not_ face this.  (The video opens at 29:53, which is the segment on
long COVID-19.)  
- There are still about 2,000 deaths each week.  More than 100,000 deaths/year, largely
  avoidable but for our refusal to face facts and act accordingly.  
- Now Long COVID is impairing the lives of something on the close order of several million
  Americans(exact number unknown).  
  o Often it's hard to get doctors even to take you seriously!  
  o From one sufferer:  
    > After having COVID the first time and recovering fine, I assumed that having it
    > again wouldn't be a problem, because I had been OK during my first infection.  And I
    > couldn't have been more wrong.  
- David Putrino, neuroscientist and physical therapist, is director of rehab innovation at
  the Mount Sinai Health System in New York:  
  o The heartbreaking stories of people crippled, financially broken, and feeling like
    their lives are coming to an end are quite common.  
  o His clinic alone has seen over 3,000 Long COVID patients in the last 3 years.  
  o In an article in _The Lancet_, he reports ~200 symptoms associated, affecting
    virtually _every organ system_.  It's a portfolio of conditions caused by an underlying
    acute viral infection.  
	> All we can do right now is symptom management. &hellip; But we're not curing
    > them. We're getting them to the point where they __may__ be a __little__ more
    > functional.  
	> &hellip;  
    > But what we understand very clearly is that
    > &hellip; this is __not a psychological illness__.  This is __not a psychosomatic
    > illness__.  
	> &hellip;  
	> We need the public to understand that dying is not your only risk of serious
    > life-changing effects from having an acute COVID infection.  And we need the
    > __government to support a lot more in the way of infection prevention__.  
  o An (uncited) article in _Nature Reviews Microbiology_ estimates that there are about
    65 million people world-wide with Long COVID.  If we estimate the US at 4.25% of world
    population, that works out to 65 million * 0.0425 = 2,762,500 Long COVID cases in the
    US.  

__Conclusions:__  
- The Omicron lineage is the _terroir du jour_, in particular XBB.1.5 at this particular
  time.  
- Long COVID is a severe danger which imposes disability for _years_, and currently
  afflicts about 6 million world-wide and about 2.7 million in the US (rough estimates).  


## Our crazy reactions, or: why our death rate is so high  

Ok, that's what the virus is doing.  Are we reacting intelligently, or even _slightly_
more intelligently than at the beginning of the pandemic?  

Stupidity is always a capital crime when Nature is the judge.
[The whole point of civilization is to be less brutal than Nature]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#:~:text=The%20whole%20point%20of%20civilization,less%20brutal%20than%20nature.),
but we seem to be failing that test of civilization.  

To wit, the following from neo-fascist America:  

### Idaho legislators propose to _criminalize_ mRNA vaccines  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-idaho-1.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="Morris @ Fox Propaganda: Idaho bill to criminalize COVID-19 vaccines" title="Morris @ Fox Propaganda: Idaho bill to criminalize mRNA COVID-19 vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-idaho-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-idaho-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="147" alt="Nichols &amp; Boyle @ Idaho legislature: Criminalize mRNA COVID-19 vaccines" title="Nichols &amp; Boyle @ Idaho legislature: Criminalize mRNA COVID-19 vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Via the still-indispensable Eric Topol comes a story gleefully reported by the
_Fox 'News'_ Republican propaganda channel: a bill in the Idaho legislature to _criminalize_
giving mRNA COVID-19 vaccines! <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

Just because nobody should depend on the odious _Fox 'News'_ for anything, we confirmed
this with a parallel story in _Talking Points Memo._  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
Even with one confirming source, that's&hellip; well, pretty breathtaking.  So we dug up
the bill text <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, shown here.  The relevant bits are in
Section 18-296:  

> 18-926. ADMINISTERING AN MRNA VACCINE. (1) Notwithstanding any other
> provision of law, a person may not provide or administer a vaccine developed
> using messenger ribonucleic acid technology for use in an individual or any
> other __mammal__ in this state.  
>  
> (2) A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.

What is it about _mammals:_ I can vaccinate my pet fish, but not my cat?  Or is it
a [category error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake) to attempt to make sense of this?  

In particular, at least one of the legislators in question, Idaho Sen Tammy Nichols, owns
up to this bill, and is proud enough of it to tweet about it with her own name attached:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/nichols_senator/status/1626106794916601856"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-idaho-4.jpg" width="550" height="243" alt="Nichols @ Twitter: Yes, I introduced a bill to criminalize mRNA vaccines" title="Nichols @ Twitter: Yes, I introduced a bill to criminalize mRNA vaccines" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Now, to be sure, this is _proposed_ legislation, at a state level, and untested in court.
Most proposed laws die in ignominious obscurity.  The scary part is that this wasn't
laughed out of the legislature, and that it proposes all of us should also die in
ignominious obscurity without vaccination.  

I mean, just consider how _bone-headed stupid_ you have to be to say this publicly, and
put your name on it.  (Were it a joke on Nichols perpetrated by another legislator, it
would have been marginally funny.  Especially the floor debate.)  

### Florida Republicans pass resolution to ban COVID-19 vaccines  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-forbes-1.jpg" width="400" height="193" alt="Lee @ Forbes: Florida Repubs pass resolution to ban COVID-19 vaccines" title="Lee @ Forbes: Florida Repubs pass resolution to ban COVID-19 vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Via [PZ at _Pharyngula_](https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/02/26/wow-florida/)
comes news that the Florida, the Official Hell-Hole of the United States, Republicans
passed a resolution giving the governor &mdash; the fascist Ron Desantis &mdash; the power
to _ban COVID-19 vaccines!_  

We checked PZ's sources, and yes, he's unfortunately correct: both
_Forbes_ <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> &hellip; and the Florida local station WINK
News <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> &hellip; confirm this wretched "Ban the Jab" resolution.  

Now, let's be fair: this is a resolution, not a binding law.  And it's the product of the
Republican party at the Lee County level, not in general.  But it does take the
ideological temperature, and the reading is ugly.  They don't just want to push back on
vaccine mandates, or refuse to get the vaccine themselves; they want to use state power to
_force the rest of us to remain unvaccinated_ in spite of clear medical findings to the
contrary by the FDA and CDC.  

The author is one Joe Sansone, who described his motivation as (__emphasis__ mine):  

> The Lee County Republican Party is going to be on the vanguard of this campaign to __stop
> the genocide__ because we have __foreign non-governmental entities__ that are __unleashing
> biological weapons__ on the American people.  

Umm&hellip; what?!  You think COVID-19 is a foreign bio-weapon, _and_ you think the
correct response is to ban vaccines so nobody will be protected?  Pick a side, dude!  

Or, in the words of _Forbes:_  

> Stop the genocide? Foreign non-governmental entities unleashing biological weapons? Holy
> [space-laser-operating](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/really-republicans/#the-3-republican-stooges)-lizard-alien-living-on-a-flat-Earth-with-a-5G-transmitter.  

Apparently that's not weird enough for Sansone, because he also claimed:  

> If you got this shot, you go home and hug your pregnant wife—she can have a miscarriage
> through skin contact.  

So&hellip; he thinks we vaccinated people are somehow shedding paraproteins or something
that puts unvaccinated people in danger, e.g., of miscarriage?  Quite the opposite is
true: vaccination _lowers_ the risk of miscarriage, because getting COVID-19 while
pregnant is a _terrible_ idea.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-WINK-2.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-WINK-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Hudak &amp; Wirtz @ WINK News: Close-up of partial text of COVID-19 vaccine ban resolution" title="Hudak &amp; Wirtz @ WINK News: Close-up of partial text of COVID-19 vaccine ban resolution" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
It gets worse.  If you look at the close-up WINK News obtained of some of the text of the
resolution, you can see some pretty claims that are not just wrong, but verging on
psychotic delusions, making at least the following nonsensical claims:  
- "strong and credible" evidence that _both_ COVID-19 _and_ the vaccines are bioweapons  
- Pfizer's clinical trial of their vaccine somehow had 1223 deaths (the real number is 0),
  as well as 158,000 adverse events (impressive, in a trial with only 
  [43,548 participants](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/pfizer-vaccine-passes-vrbpac-review/#formal-scientific-publication-in-the-nejm)!)  
- "strong and credible" evidence that mRNA vaccines alter human DNA (truly, stupendously
  ignorant)  
- massive government and corporate fraud across FDA, CDC, Pfizer, Moderna, media, tech
  companies all conspired together to lie about this (a classic schizophrenia delusion of
  persecution, especially given [what we know about the lifetime of such conspiracies](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/conspiracy-life/))  
- the clinical trials constituted a "violation of the Nuremberg Code and therefore
  constitute crimes against humanity" (a classic schizophrenic delusion of grandeur)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-PT-1.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="Psychology Today: Credentials of Joseph Sansone" title="Psychology Today: Credentials of Joseph Sansone" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I'm desperately hunting for some
[redeeming social value](https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,941236,00.html)
here, so let's dig into this guy Joe Sansone a bit and see if he's maybe a bit better than
all this looks.  

From his _Psychology Today_ profile <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> we see that he's a
licensed psychotherapist, practicing in Florida.  A few queasy feelings bubble to the top
when we see that he strongly emphasizes hypnosis as his main therapeutic mode, that
all sessions are in person, not by telehealth, and he prefers cash or credit card payments
instead of insurance.  

Ok, that's a bit queasy, but&hellip; let's give him the benefit of the doubt and look further.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-sofia-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-sofia-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="165" alt="Wikipedia: Sofia University (California)" title="Wikipedia: Sofia University (California)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
What are his credentials?  He has bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees, which is
pretty good.  But his doctorate is from [Sofia University (not the one in Bulgaria)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_University_(California)),
of which I had never heard before.  So&hellip; what's that?  

The front of the Wikipedia page on Sofia University warns us that it appears to be written
as an advertisement, and the talk page warns the text is largely copied from the Sofia web
site.  It's a private, for-profit university&hellip; which is kind of the last straw for
me.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-tp-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-tp-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="105" alt="Wikipedia: Transpersonal psychology" title="Wikipedia: Transpersonal psychology" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
But wait!  There are more straws!  

It grew out of something called the California Institute for Transpersonal Psychology.
What's that?  Wikipedia helpfully informs us that
[transpersonal psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpersonal_psychology)
"may be" a fringe theory, and the explanation even in Wikipedia may not give appropriate
weight to the mainstream view.

> __Transpersonal psychology__, or __spiritual psychology__, is a sub-field or school of
> psychology that claims to integrate the spiritual and transcendent aspects of the human
> experience with the framework of modern psychology. The _transpersonal_ is defined as
> "experiences in which the sense of identity or self extends beyond (trans) the
> individual or personal to encompass wider aspects of humankind, life, psyche or
> cosmos".[1] It has also been defined as "development beyond conventional, personal or
> individual levels".[2]  

Ok, that's the last straw for real this time.  I'm a religious person myself, but one
simply _does not_ mix religion with psychotherapy.  While my religion can inform me on
_why_ I need to practice with compassion and generosity, it does not override the science
behind _how_ I choose to do my work.  I'm happy to explore the possibility of a spiritual
side to humanity, but therapy is _medical treatment_, not spiritual advice.  

__Conclusion:__ This resolution is full of lunatic conspiracy theories, written by a
person who practices psychotherapy emphasizing hypnosis and cash payments, with a degree
from what is apparently a private/for-profit pseudo-university, and mixes his religious
preferences with therapy on his clients.  

Ladies and gentlemen, your modern Republican party.  

### Montana legislators propose to forbid the vaccinated to donate blood  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-montanan-1.jpg" width="400" height="196" alt="Girten @ Daily Montanan: Bill to ban blood donation by vaccinated" title="Girten @ Daily Montanan: Bill to ban blood donation by vaccinated" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I've now forgotten who showed me this; that's good, because I'm pretty sure I don't want
to repeat the journey.  It appears the Montana legislature has introduced House Bill 645,
to prevent vaccinated people from donating blood. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  

Do you remember how the unvaccinated took to calling themselves "purebloods"?
<sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> It's a weird mash-up of the canard that mRNA vaccines alter
your DNA making your "blood impure" (racist dog-whistle), and the "pureblood" magical
families of the _Harry Potter_ novels.  Do they _just not get_ the fact that the purebloods were
the _bad guys_ in those books?  They were the racists of the magical world,
the analog of Nazis demanding racial purity.  (A good heuristic:
[once you identify the Nazis, pick the other side]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#:~:text=Once%20you%20identify%20the%20side%20with%20the%20Nazis,pick%20the%20other%20side).)  

Apparently in Idaho this extends to not wanting to "mix blood" (another racist trope) of
the vaccinated and unvaccinated.  If you have the stomach to wade through the intellectual
sewage, I recovered the text of the bill <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> &ndash; and
it's about as bad as you think.  

### Extreme anti-vaxxers propose masking&hellip; _around vaccinated people!_  

Usually vaccine conspiracy theories go along with stubborn refusal to wear masks.  Oddly,
some of the vaccine kooks are convinced, like Joe Sansone in the Florida bill above, that
vaccinated people are somehow dangerous.  So _now_ they'll be wearing masks to protect
themselves from vaccinated people:

"Vaccine shedding"&hellip; of _what_, exactly?  Paraproteins?  Alien DNA?  My mind is so
thoroughly boggled, I'm getting boggle fatigue.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Oh, [good grief, as Charlie Brown used to say](https://twitter.com/SchulzMuseum/status/1533826525098921985).
As if there isn't enough _real_ crap in the world to worry about: Russian genocide in
Ukraine, fascism revenant world-wide, Republicans trying to slash Social
Security/Medicare/Medicaid, banning books from schools, arresting drag performers, and a
litany of woes.  

Notice that all the delusional, coercive, and cruel things above come from red states in
the US.  They're so hungry for paranoia, they have to _make up_ things to fear.  

This is not without historical precedent.  Back in the Victorian period, when London
began to introduce sanitation measures like clean water sources and sewage processing,
people actually resisted.  We are reminded of this by Kashif Pirzada, and emergency
physician who spends his off hours in the honorable endeavor of fighting misinformation.
Here he's showing us extracts from the _Times of London_ from 1848 - 1854:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/KashPrime/status/1630922207068147714"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-pirzada-1.jpg" width="550" height="567" alt="Pirzada @ Twitter: People fought clean water &amp; sewage processing in cholera times in 1854" title="Pirzada @ Twitter: People fought clean water &amp; sewage processing in cholera times in 1854" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

That seems worth fact-checking, since it's such a body-slam to compare vaccine resistance
to the resistance against clean water, sewage processing, and just _washing._  So, we
checked this in _Snopes_ <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup> and got a thumbs up: yes,
this really was a thing.  

It appears in the last nearly 2 centuries, conservative thinking has not evolved a bit.
They resisted public health then, and they still do.  The thing about "public health" is
that you can't omit the "public" &ndash; it really has to be a collective endeavor, or it
won't work.  

Right-wing allergy to anything "collective" is sometimes lethal.  

Now, you might reasonably accuse me of indulging a taste for
[schadenfreude pie (homage &agrave; Scalzi)](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2006/09/26/how-to-make-a-schadenfreude-pie/)
here.  Just looking at the examples above, there is some partial truth to that.  

But it's also true that I've got some personal skin in the game here, avoiding COVID-19.
Consider what Delthia Hicks has to say here about the frequency and severity of Long
COVID-19:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/DelthiaRicks/status/1633091523192541185"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-15-covid-disgrace-hicks-1.jpg" width="550" height="617" alt="Hicks @ Twitter: 30% of pts over 50 have longer impairments after COVID-19" title="Hicks @ Twitter: 30% of pts over 50 have longer impairments after COVID-19" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Now, here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend
[we got COVID-19 last August](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/covid-index-post/),
due to my forced confinement in close quarters with unmasked knuckleheads on a shuttle
bus.  We both recovered, thanks to paxlovid.  But I got a rebound, and was basically
incapacitated for a month.  

Here we are, 7 months later.  I _still_ have some mild cognitive impairment.  I can't
really multitask.  It's difficult to pick up new things, especially when spoken rapidly by
people I don't know.  My writing is _much_ slower:  
- I used to take apart a scientific paper, get the data, reanalyze it, compare
  conclusions, and write up a critique in about 2 days.  
- Now it takes me _weeks_ to do the same thing, sometimes reading the same paragraphs 10
  times without really getting it.  
  
I started this post on 2023-Mar-03.  It doesn't contain any mathematical analysis, just
reading and summarizing.  But even so, it took me almost 2 weeks to get it up.  

Much of my mind is not yet healed.  While I know on some level that it takes 7-9 months
for "brain fog" to clear up <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup> <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>,
it's nonetheless a difficult wait.  Being able to use my mind effectively has been a _huge_
part of my identity ever since childhood; COVID-19 has thus far taken that away from me.  

I _hope_ that since 7 months have elapsed, I should be returning to normal.  But I have
daily fears that I might not.  

So yeah, it's kinda personal with me.

See &sect; 3.3.1: 55.5% (CL: 52.5% - 58.8%) of patients still experienced "brain fog" in month 7, so that's close enough for me to the median time to recovery.  So, to my mind I say: see you in 2023-Feb.  It's very frustrating to hear people say "COVID's over, man!" when the consequences to me personally are somewhat high. [↩](#fn12a)
