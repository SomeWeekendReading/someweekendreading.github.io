Times are dark, but sometimes there are glimmers of progress.  


## Ok, what progress?  

When I was a kid &ndash; we're talking long ago here &ndash; the concept of a Black
president would have been unthinkable.  A woman even more so.  

We haven't exactly _solved_ racism in the US, but at least we're better than we were a
lifetime ago in my semi-rural origins.  As evidence, consider this news picture:

<a href="https://twitter.com/liberaladvoc/status/1636728724535103489"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-28-some-progress-taoiseach-w-vp.jpg" width="550" height="617" alt="Irish Taoiseach and his husband with VP Harris and her husband" title="Irish Taoiseach and his husband with VP Harris and her husband" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- _Center right:_ [US Vice President Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris).
  She is the first woman in that position.  Her mother was a Tamil biologist, and her
  father is a Jamaican economics professor; both emigrated to the US.  So Harris is both
  Indian and Afro-Caribbean.  
- _Right:_ Harris's husband, [Douglas Emhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff).
  He is both the first husband and the first Jewish spouse of a US Vice President.  He was
  a director of a law firm and a distinguished visiting professor at the Georgetown
  University Law Center.  
- _Center left:_ Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister)
  [Leo Varadkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Varadkar).  As the son of a doctor
  from Bombay, is is of partial Indian descent.  
- _Left:_ Matt Barrett, husband of Varadkar and a doctor at Mater Misericordiae University
  Hospital.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-28-some-progress-emhoff-varadkar.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-28-some-progress-emhoff-varadkar-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="200" alt="Doug Emhoff and Leo Varadkar: Separated at birth?" title="Doug Emhoff and Leo Varadkar: Separated at birth?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
So we have an Indian/Afro-Caribbean American woman, a Jewish American man, an Indian Irish man, and
his same-sex Irish husband.  I guess we _have_ made progress, especially since this photo was
_not_ considered remarkable enough to be front-page news.  

Interestingly, people have remarked upon the resemblance between Doug Emhoff and Leo
Varadkar, as shown here.  Don't they look like brothers?  Perhaps even twins separated at
birth?  I think they look even more alike in the foursome picture above.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Ok, we _have_ made lots of progress since the days of my childhood.  

But it's (a) not enough, and (b) something we have to fight to keep, given the revenant
nihilism and fascism on the right.  

_Comme d'habitude._  


## Addendum 2023-Mar-29: Partions of India and the UK  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-28-some-progress-cnn-1.jpg" width="400" height="122" alt="Mogul @ CNN: PMs of South Asian descent in Britain, Scotland, and Ireland" title="Mogul @ CNN: PMs of South Asian descent in Britain, Scotland, and Ireland" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I think it was [Charlie Stross](https://wandering.shop/@cstross) who pointed out a couple
of days ago that Ireland, Scotland, and Britain are now all led by Prime Ministers of
South Asian descent (i.e., near ancestors from India and Pakistan).  Fact-checking that,
we find _CNN_ in agreement <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  
- [Humza Yousaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humza_Yousaf), of Pakstani descent, is the
  Prime Minister of Scotland.  
- [Leo Varadkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Varadkar), of Indian descent, is the
  Prime Minister of Ireland.  
- [Rishi Sunak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak), of descent from a Hindu family
  in East Africa, is the Prime Minister of Britain.  

Now that Brexit is grinding hard in Britain, talk of Scottish independence is rising
again.  It makes some sense, as England is reliably further right-wing than Scotland, and
Scotland _wants_ to be part of the European Union.  

The irony here runs deep:  
- At the end of the British Raj in the mid-20th century, Brits presided over the partition
  of India into modern-day India, Pakistan, and what eventually became Bangladesh.  
- Now in the early-mid 21st century if Scotland wants independence to join the EU (or
  Northern Ireland wants to join the EU by joining Ireland), then it will be people of
  Indian and Pakistani descent presiding over the partion of the United Kingdom.  

Justice doesn't get any more poetic than that, even if the judge were to be
[WB Yeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats).  

I wonder if Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi newspapers will spell _schadenfreude_
correctly?
