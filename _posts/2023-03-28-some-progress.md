Times are dark, but sometimes there are glimmers of progress.  


## Ok, what progress?  

When I was a kid &ndash; we're talking long ago here &ndash; the concept of a Black
president would have been unthinkable.  A woman even more so.  

We haven't exactly _solved_ racism in the US, but at least we're better than we were a
lifetime ago in my semi-rural origins.  As evidence, consider this news picture:

<a href="https://twitter.com/liberaladvoc/status/1636728724535103489"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-28-some-progress-taoiseach-w-vp.jpg" width="550" height="617" alt="Irish Taoiseach and his husband with VP Harris and her husband" title="Irish Taoiseach and his husband with VP Harris and her husband" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- _Center right:_ [US Vice President Kamala Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris).
  She is the first woman in that position.  Her mother was a Tamil biologist, and her
  father is a Jamaican economics professor; both emigrated to the US.  So Harris is both
  Indian and Afro-Caribbean.  
- _Right:_ Harris's husband, [Douglas Emhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff).
  He is both the first husband and the first Jewish spouse of a US Vice President.  He was
  a director of a law firm and a distinguished visiting professor at the Georgetown
  University Law Center.  
- _Center left:_ Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister)
  [Leo Varadkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Varadkar).  As the son of a doctor
  from Bombay, is is of partial Indian descent.  
- _Left:_ Matt Barrett, husband of Varadkar and a doctor at Mater Misericordiae University
  Hospital.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-28-some-progress-emhoff-varadkar.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-28-some-progress-emhoff-varadkar-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="200" alt="Doug Emhoff and Leo Varadkar: Separated at birth?" title="Doug Emhoff and Leo Varadkar: Separated at birth?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
So we have an Indian/Afro-Caribbean American woman, a Jewish American man, an Indian Irish man, and
his same-sex Irish husband.  I guess we _have_ made progress, especially since this photo was
_not_ considered remarkable enough to be front-page news.  

Interestingly, people have remarked upon the resemblance between Doug Emhoff and Leo
Varadkar, as shown here.  Don't they look like brothers?  Perhaps even twins separated at
birth?  I think they look even more alike in the foursome picture above.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Ok, we _have_ made lots of progress since the days of my childhood.  

But it's (a) not enough, and (b) something we have to fight to keep, given the revenant
nihilism and fascism on the right.  

_Comme d'habitude._
