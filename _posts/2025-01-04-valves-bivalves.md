It appears a Polish city has a particularly clever way of sensing pollution in their water
supply and closing valves.  With bivalves.  


## Natural Sensors

It appears that the city of Poznań, in western Poland, has an intriguing method of assaying and
  controlling their water supply. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> 
<sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>
<sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> They're partly worried about terrorist attacks on the
water supply, but also about bacterial contamination.   And, being in an old East-Bloc
nation, the occasional heavy metal contaminant, like chromium.  It's a problem, having to
test for so many things at once!  

They came upon an intriguing solution, involving local mussels.  They normally are very
sensitive to a variety of pollutants, which cause them to close their shells.  So 8
mussels are recruited, glued to a station where they will be fed and enjoy a stream of
local water.  However, as shown here, a magnet on a spring is glued (harmlessly) to their
shell.  

If more than 4 out of the 8 mussels no longer care for the taste of the water and close
their shells, then a computer closes off the water supply.  The bivalves control the
valves.  (The story does not say what the city does for water in that eventuality.)

After a few months, the mussels become too accustomed to their new lives and are thus
returned to the wild and replaced by new mussels.  At least on the surface, it sounds
remarkably humane, as well as clever.

This is apparently the practice in 50 water plants in Poland, as well as 1 in Russia.
(Apparently several American cities use bluegills for a similar purpose?)  Of
course, the mussels won't tell you _which_ pollutant offends them, but it's a good
first-line defense.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Bivalves control valves.  

Yeah, that crummy little joke was pretty much the whole reason for this post.
