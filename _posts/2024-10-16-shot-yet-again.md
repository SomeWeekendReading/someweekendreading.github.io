Today I got shot&hellip; i.e., vaccinated against COVID-19&hellip; _again._  


## Yes, I Am a Serial Vaccinee

By my count, and according to the state vaccine registry, this is my 9th COVID-19
vaccination.  You might, only slightly unreasonably, wonder "Why so many times?"  Surely,
COVID-19 has gone away, right?  

No, _COVID-19 has most definitely not gone away!_  Consider the data shown here, from the
Pandemic Mitigation Collaborative <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-16-shot-yet-again-pmc-infections.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-16-shot-yet-again-pmc-infections-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="219" alt="Pandemic Mitigation Collab: infections vs time as of 2024-Oct-16" title="Pandemic Mitigation Collab: infections vs time as of 2024-Oct-16" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

- The horizontal axis is just time, starting in 2020-Jan-01, just when the pandemic
  started.  
- The vertical axes on the left and right are _slightly_ different, but they both amount
  to the number of infections as calculated by a couple methods.  

Now, let's see what this graph tells us:  
- See the little peak all the way over at the left, in the sprint of 2020?  That was the
  start of the pandemic.  Remember how scared we all were then?  Hold that thought.  
- See the peak at the right, for this last summer?  See how much higher it is than the
  initial pandemic peak?  See how it grinds on much longer?  _That's_ the state of
  COVID-19 today, with _more_ infections over _longer_ periods of time.
- See the purple part at the furthest right, where it's rising higher than the initial
  peak?  That's what's happening _now_ (and predicted for the next couple months).  

What part of that plot says to you that COVID-19 has "gone away"?  None of it, that's
what.  

COVID-19 has _not_ gone away.  If anything, it is _worse_ now than at the beginning of the
pandemic.  Fortunately, most people have some degree of resistance from prior vaccination
or infection.  

So we're not _dying_ quite as often&hellip; but we _are_ getting infected.  

Now, listen to this.  Look at me.  This is important: every time you get COVID-19, you are
doing damage to your organs and your immune system, and putting yourself at _increasing_
risk of Long COVID.  Speaking as someone with an official diagnosis of Long COVID brain
fog from just one infection, trust me that Long COVID is not something you want.  

_Not at all._  

This is very bad, and you should take whatever actions you reasonably can to avoid it.
For now, that includes getting a booster this fall.  It _might_ elevate to masking again
this winter.  


## Fall Vaccinations

So, here we are.  Last fall it was vaccines for COVID-19, flu and RSV.  RSV is not (yet) an
annual vaccine, so no need to repeat that.  Last spring it was got a COVID-19 booster.  This
fall, it's a COVID-19 booster and a flu shot.  

Last summer, we live-blogged the FDA VRBPAC meeting at which the strains in the virus were
decided.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  The VRBPAC recommended a monovalent vaccine on
the JN.1 strain, but the FDA afterwards overruled them and chose the more current KP.2
strain.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-16-shot-yet-again-cdc-strains.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-16-shot-yet-again-cdc-strains-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="254" alt="CDC: Nowcast of SARS-CoV2 strains" title="CDC: Nowcast of SARS-CoV2 strains" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
This attempt to get ahead of the SARS-CoV2 virus was a good idea, though now the
virus has moved on to other strains, fortunately closely related.  The CDC "nowcast" of viral
strains <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, shown here, says that among the big movers are
KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, KP.2.3, and KP.3.1.1.  (Also the LB.1 strain, about which I know
nothing.)  So it's reassuring that the vaccine is focused on a strain closely related to
those circulating.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-16-shot-yet-again-yale-xec.jpg" width="400"
height="317" alt="Yale Medicine: XEC variant" title="Yale Medicine: XEC variant" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Still, an article from _Yale Medicine_ <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> informs us that
the XEC subvariant of Omicron is growing as of the beginning of October.  It accounts for
5.7% of infections in the US for now.  It's concerning because it rapidly out-competed
other strains in Europe this summer.  

XEC appears to be a combination rearrangement of KP.3.3 and KS.1.1.  Consulting infectious
disease specialist Dr. Scott Roberts, the article tells us:  

> But the newly updated Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines, designed to target KP.2 (the
> dominant COVID strain this past spring), and the latest Novavax vaccine that targets an
> earlier strain — JN.1 — should __also provide protection against XEC,__ he adds.  
>  
> "Even though XEC is recombinant, it's composed of two Omicron subvariants that were
> expected to be addressed by the updated vaccines," Dr. Roberts says. "From that
> standpoint, although this new variant might diminish the immunity the vaccines provide
> by a little bit, I'm optimistic that we're still going to have some degree of protection
> from both recent infections and updated vaccines."  
> &hellip;  
> "__I always recommend getting vaccinated by October at the latest,__ so you’ll have peak
> immunity during the holidays, when there's a lot of travel and mingling with family, often
> indoors where the virus can spread more easily."  
> &hellip;  
> __If you do test positive for COVID, antivirals such as Paxlovid are recommended.__  

So the cross-immunity between strains should be pretty good, and here at Ch&acirc;teau
Weekend we're all in for that.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-15-shot-yet-again-shotshot.jpg" width="400" height="427" alt="My left arm is my COVID vaccinatin' arm." title="My left arm is my COVID vaccinatin' arm." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So here we are, mid-October, getting boosted.  

As evidence, we present this picture of our left dorsal manipulator tentacle (a.k.a. "my
flabby arm" complete with old-man hair) being injected with the Moderna 2024-2025 booster by a
very gentle, pleasant, and agreeable pharmacist.  

She also gave me the high-dose flu vaccine for seniors &ndash; the one you youngsters are
not yet strong enough to take! &ndash; in the other arm.  I've always done it that way,
COVID-19 in the left &amp; flu in the right, on the theory that the lymph nodes on the
left and right are each becoming specialists for a disease.  Probably superstition, of
course!  But if it makes me get vaccinated, at least it's a _useful_ superstition.  

The Weekend Editrix will be similarly vaccinated next week, due to her work meeting
schedule.  (Yes, she's now retired from her work.  But her replacement then went out on
disability, so they called her back.  Alas, they called her back to her work, but _not_
her pay, because charitable non-profits are like that, always asking for _pro bono_ work.)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-16-shot-yet-again-publishers-chair.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-16-shot-yet-again-publishers-chair-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher test piloting a new chair." title="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher test piloting a new chair." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The Weekend Publisher (in the seat of the chair) and Assistant Weekend Publisher (on the back of
the chair) are shown (non-)reacting here.  Reassured that their humans are behaving responsibly and
will thus likely keep the stream of brushings and cat food coming, they have moved on to
other matters.  In this case, the important matter of test piloting some new chairs in the
living room. (Initial feedback is that they seem to have pronounced themselves satisfied.)  

Renewed immunity for the winter season and holidays is good.  Go thou and do likewise!  You
should live, and not die.  Stand by for an update tomorrow on the side effects,
anticipated to be mild.  

Now&hellip; if only in the US we could get political immunity against Trump and Republican
fascism&hellip; _then_ I would begin to hope tenatively for an American future again.  

[(_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._)]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)  

## Addendum 2024-Oct-17: The Usual Suspects  

Side effects are about as expected: 0.5&deg;C, very tired, achy muscles and joints, sore
shoulders.  (Though, to be fair: some of the achy muscles are from a physical therapy
appointment yesterday to deal with an injury.)  

Overall, quite tolerable.  Happy to see my innate immune system yapping like a guard dog,
while my acquired immune system meditates upon the spike protein and polishes its grenade
launcher.  (Well, _antibody_ launcher.  But that's _sorta_ like a grenade, immunologically
speaking?)  

All is well, it seems.
