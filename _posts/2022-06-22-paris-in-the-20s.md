Ever wonder how the past _really_ looked?  Not the jerky, off-speed, black &amp; white
silent stuff, but as if you were really there?  Some video restorers are trying to
recreate those experiences.  


## Paris in the 1920s  

There's apparently a hobby among video folk to engage in a little
[&Gammad;&Tau;&Phi;]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#%CF%9C%CE%A4%CE%A6), by
remastering old film to modern frame rates so they don't look so jerky, colorizing them,
and adding sound.  The results can be quite striking, since we can see people in the past
moving like _people_, not the jerky, sped-up mannequins they otherwise resemble.

And so it is here, with a video of some 8 minutes summarizing what it would have been like
to experience Paris in the 1920s.  The video is real; the colorization and added sound
are plausible, but artificial.  

It's beautiful.  Almost as beautiful as [my cat in his previous incarnation, when he was
catting around fin-de-siècle Paris]({{ site.baseurl }}/le-chat-noir/).  It kind of makes
me long for an era which largely no longer exists, broken by war and modernity.  Yes, I
know that's a fantasy.  But it's a fantasy that makes me want to heal the world
([tikkun olam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam)!) in a way that I'd like to keep
going.  

My father would have just been graduating from high school in those days.  It's a pleasant
thought of an alternative universe, in which he'd have been fortunate enough to take a
_wanderjahr_ to experience Paris &amp; train his considerable skills as an (amateur) artist.
