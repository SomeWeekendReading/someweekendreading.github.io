Today I came across an unexpected source of encouragement in the matter of Russia and
Ukraine.  


## Arnold?!  Wait&hellip; really?

    I love the Russian people. That is why I have to tell you the truth. Please watch and share.

Umm&hellip; [_Arnold Schwarzenegger_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger)
as a source of political and even _spiritual_ inspiration?  Really?!  

Yeah, really.  Honest, it surprised me too.  

I never had much use for the hyper-masculine image of bodybuilders, or sportsball players
of any sort.  And _Terminator_ &amp; _Conan_ were&hellip; well, not that great as movies.  And then he
became Republican politician, so he's sorta outside my regular feeding grounds, ya know?  

But we must be prepared to accept wisdom from _any_ source.  We must be _especially_ eager to
recognize wisdom when it comes apparently from the "other side", which turns out to be the
same side after all.  

And so it is here.  

Schwarzenegger made a heartfelt plea on a YouTube video, which then got tweeted, and 
_The Atlantic_ picked up the transcript as an article. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
Some of the high points, of which there are surprisingly many in just 9min 16sec:  
- He starts, in a flourish of rhetorical brilliance, with a story of the Russian
  weightlifter
  [Yury Petrovich Vlasov (Юрий Петрович Власов)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yury_Vlasov), 
  whom he met as a young boy.  They were introduced, somehow.  Yuri Petrovich treated him kindly and
  respectfully, with a friendly smile.  This moment of kindness had an unforgettable impact.  
  - Schwarzenegger admiringly put up a photo of Yuri Petrovich in his home in his parents'
    home in Austria, causing some friction with his father.  His father had been conscripted
    in the Nazi army in WWII, and was badly injured in Stalingrad.  He spent the rest of his
    life in pain from shrapnel, a broken back, and the extreme emotional pain of knowing he
    had participated in the Nazi campaign.  So he was not happy to see a Russian, and he and
    his son fought.  
  - Later while filming in Moscow, they met again.  The experience confirmed
    Schwarzenegger's impression of the man as kind, smart, and generous.  
- Having established his _bona fides_ as someone who loves Russian people, he tries to
  explain to them the lies they're being fed.  
  - For example, the attempt to "de-Nazify" Ukraine is laughable on the surface: it's a
    country with a democratically elected, Jewish president, whose grandfather's 3
    brothers were murdered by Nazis. (3:39 - 3:51)  
  - The blame lies not on the Ukrainians nor on the Russians, but on those in the
    Kremlin.  The Russian people are simply innocent victims.  
- He speaks from a place of deep compassion:
  - He looks into the camera, and says to the Russian soldiers with incredible sympathy:  
    > "I don't want you to be broken like my father." (6:55 - 7:10)  
  - He looks into the camera again, and speaking of those demonstrating in Russia against
    the war, says:  
    > "The world has seen your bravery. We know that you have suffered the
    > consequences of your courage. You have been arrested. You have been jailed and you’ve
    > been beaten. You are my new heroes. You have the strength of Yury Petrovich
    > Vlasov. You have the true heart of Russia.  My dear Russian friends, may God bless you
    > all." (8:38 - 9:16)  

It takes a lot to bring tears to my eyes at the words of a former athlete turned actor in
movies I don't like turned politician for a party I don't like.  But&hellip; give it up
for Arnold, because looking into his eyes at those two moments did it.  There's an awful
lot of compassion for the pain of others, and a desire to help them do better.  This is as
we all _should_ feel toward each other.  

Seems to me like a _very_ good message.  I'd be fascinated to know what my Russian friends
think of it.

And that's not the first time he's hit the nail on the head.  Here's a video he recorded
after the events of 2021-Jan-06, when American Nazi sympathizers attempted to disrupt the
official counting of the Electoral College.  It's very personal: "I grew up in the ruins
of a country that suffered the loss of its democracy."  He correctly called Trump a liar
attempting to overthrow a fair election.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Ok, I changed my mind: this is a smart man, and a good man.  I'm happy to listen to him
when he has something to say in his areas of expertise.  

(Well, maybe not body-building.  I mean, he's an _expert_, I'm just not interested.  But
the other stuff, yeah.  Good guy.  Not perfect, of course, what with a couple extramarital
affairs.  Still, good for many purposes.)  

I'm very, very happily surprised.  Feel free to make fun of me for not already knowing
this. I promise it's ok.
