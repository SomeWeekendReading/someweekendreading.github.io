It's easy for the rich to avoid taxation in the US &ndash; it appears that the 400 richest
Americans now have an effective tax rate _below_ that of the bottom half of income
earners.  How unusual is this?  


## _Very_ Unusual, and _Very_ Destabilizing

It is, of course, _extremely_ unusual, and in fact downright regressive instead of the
progressive tax system we like to think we have.  An article by Gabriel Zucman in the
_NYT_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> gives us the data over time, as shown here.  Zucman
is an economist at the Paris School of Economics and UC Berkeley.  

This is a startling graphic: the effective (average) tax rate for the 400 richest
Americans has gone from 56% down to 23% since 1960.  In the meantime, the rate that most
of the rest of us pay has gone from 22% to 24%, i.e., remained stable.  

The net result is our failure to _tax where the money is_, with the result that we can't
afford anything any more and Republicans talk about shutting down Medicare and Social
Security.  

This is a policy choice: we could, of course, restore upper brackets to the levels of,
say, 1975 just before Reagan, and be just fine.  We'd have to close off a bunch of tax
avoidance loopholes to prevent billionaires from hiding or fleeing, but it could be
done with things like a global minimum tax.  

This, according to Zucman, would apply to the super-wealthy: about 3,000 people
world-wide.  

But for now, the US tax code is, at the low and high ends, _not progressive at all!_  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-07-tax-the-rich-nyt-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-07-tax-the-rich-nyt-3.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="Zucman @ NYT: Corporate tax rates over time" title="Zucman @ NYT: Corporate tax rates over time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Something similar has happened to US corporate tax rates.  When I was a kid, I remember my
father saying his company paid 50% of everything they made to the government.  Now, it's
only 20%.  Even at these levels, corporations do amazing stunts like reverse acquisitions
to appear to be domiciled in some tax haven, while doing business here.  If we want to
restore corporate tax rates to their proper level, we'll need to close those loopholes,
too.

If the _New York Times_ isn't enough for you, there's _another_ piece in the distinguished
scientific journal _Nature_ to consider, beyond
[what's already been noticed last month in this CrummyLittle Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR)]({{ site.baseurl }}/unaffordable-rich/).
It's a piece by Lucas Chancel <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, reviewing the book
_Limitarianism_ by the Dutch/Belgian economist Ingrid Robeyns.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

It catalogs limits on extreme wealth throughout history, even in ancient times.  Even in
the US, in 1942 FDR proposed a tax system that would limit income to an equivalent in
today's currency of \$480,000.  

We took the other path: now the top 1% of the US population owns as much as the bottom
90%.  In a world were money can buy influence and control political speech, this is
anything but a democracy, as Robeyns documents in the disproportionate political power of
the rich.  

Robeyns points out that many sources of great wealth are either tied historically to military
conquests and slavery, or to the more brutal excesses of capitalist exploitation.  A
maximum wealth limit of around \$10 million would be easily accepted by almost the whole
population, though no doubt fiercely and hysterically resisted by the rich.  

In particular, our inability to tax the rich cripples our ability to respond to climate
change.  This is likely an extinction-level event.  Would we prefer the fall of human
civilization and possible extinction, or taxation of the wealthy to get the resources to
save all of us?

Just so you'll know we're not complete slouches here at Ch&aacute;eau Weekend, we've been
reading with an intent to write a book review of Brian Merchant's book on the history of
the Industrial Revolution's changes to British clothmaking, the sadly maligned Luddites,
and the application of all this to modern Big Tech. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

He reviews the plight of Britsh cloth-workers in the early 1800s: steam-powered machines
were destroying their livelihoods, leaving hundreds of thousands unemployed, homeless, and
starving.  The profits, of course, accrued to a very few wealthy industrialists and
aristocrats.  

The Luddites, often maligned as mere anti-technology troglodytes, were in fact a labor
movement responding with property violence to the economic violence being perpetrated upon
them.  One cannot read these first-hand accounts without some sense of pity, when workers
were advised to "find the nearest ditch, lie down in it, and die".  

Merchant's book applies this same historical analysis to the crushing impact of Big Tech,
particularly the bamboozling LLM's of artificial intelligence.  Again, all the profits go
to some economic aristocrats who contribute little in taxes, lobby to have social
programs dismantled, and fund monstrosities like Trump.  


## Effects of the Rich

Robert Reich, economics professor and former Secretary of Labor under the Clinton
administration, invites us to consider the effects of this concentration on everyday life.
In particular: why is housing so unaffordable to almost everyone?  

Rent is astronomical, and home prices are downright cosmological in their scale.  

A lot of homes have been purchased by hedge funds and private equity firms after the 2008
financial crisis.  You know how stories with hedgies and PE bros always end, right?  

This was not a small effect: in 2022, they accounted for 28% of all home sales in the US!
They used their stock market bidding software to make offers on homes faster than ordinary
people could even make offers, let alone beat them.  By 2030, at present trends, Wall St
organizations will control 40% of use single-family homes.  (Worse yet, consider what
happens when they turn, as a herd, to dump all those homes on the market when they're no
longer fashionable?)  

They've concentrated on affordable housing and communities of color, yanking prices up out
of the range of those communities.  

This, of course, comes on top of the lack of supply and ridiculous refusal of towns to
zone for dense housing.  Here in Massachusetts, every town served by the MBTA mass transit
system has to zone dense housing near terminals.  Several suburban towns, refusing to do
so, have asked if they can _get rid of mass transit_ in order not to have to allow
apartment buildings.  There is, of course, a racist undertone: they don't want "city
people", by which they mean black and brown people, to move to their white suburbs.  

Democrats have bills in both houses of Congress to prevent hedge funds and private equity
firms from owning single-family homes.  Republicans, of course, are blocking it in favor
of the interests of the rich people who fund them.  

Voting Republican is _bad._  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-07-tax-the-rich-cats-on-the-lookout.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher, on the lookout for 'Things To Come'" title="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher, on the lookout for 'Things To Come'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The Weekend Publisher and the Assistant Weekend Publisher are on the watch for
[_Things to Come_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_to_Come).  
- We can tax the rich, as the US did in the great leveling in the mid-20th
  century <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>.  
- Or we can "eat the rich", as in the French Revolution.  

It _will_ be one or the other.  We can still choose which, for a little while longer.
