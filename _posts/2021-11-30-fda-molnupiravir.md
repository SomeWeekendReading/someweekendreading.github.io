Today the FDA's Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (AMDAC) meets to decide whether or
not to recommend emergency use authorization (EUA) of Merck's molnupiravir, and antiviral
therapy for mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults.  Wanna read along?  


## What's the sitch?  

Merck's drug candidate for early treatment of COVID-19, molnupiravir, will be considered
for EUA (or even approval?) by the FDA's Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee (AMDAC).
This is the first step in a 4-step process, involving:  

1. The FDA's AMDAC committee of outside experts has to decide if the risk/benefit is
   favorable and recommend EUA to the FDA.  
2. The FDA administration has to say, "Yeah, right: let's do that." This is typically a
   couple days to a week after the AMDAC meeting, though lately with COVID-19 it's been
   the evening of the same day.  
3. The advisory committee of outside experts at the CDC has to recommend to the CDC that
   this should be recommended medical practice in the US.  I don't know when (or if?) this
   is scheduled.  
4. The CDC management has to say, "Ok, fine: that's now the standard."  

Normally this takes months, maybe a year because people are really careful about stuff on
which people will literally bet their lives. Lately, with the urgency of COVID-19 and this
being an emergency use authorization and all, it’s instead been taking weeks. So this has
been quite fast: somebody is frantically turning the crank really hard on machinery that
was never meant to go this fast. So when they get things done, we should applaud them.  

If everything goes smoothly, molnupiravir can be manufactured, shipped, stockpiled in
pharmacies, and prescribed starting sometime in December.  We would, of course, like to
see even faster action on Pfizer's COVID-19 therapeutic, paxlovid.  

Today is step 1.

The FDA announcement of the AMBAC meeting <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> has pointers to
all the meeting's submitted documents and presentations that the AMBAC will consider.  For
completists and obsessives, all 7 or 8 hours of the hearings are livestreamed, and can be
watched on YouTube as seen here.  

The agenda for the meeeting <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> is basically pretty
straightforward as these things go: 

- the usual introductory remarks &amp; boilerplate, 
- the Merck presentations, 
- the FDA presentations, 
- clarifying questions, 
- lunch, 
- public comment (which I'll avoid for the sake of my own sanity), 
- committee discussions, and 
- voting.  

The questions and the vote placed before the AMDAC <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> are:  

> 1. __DISCUSSION:__ Please discuss the potential use of molnupiravir during pregnancy –
>    both in
>     terms of risk and benefit.  
>     a. Comment if you think molnupiravir should be accessible for use in pregnancy in
>        certain scenarios, and if so, please describe what those scenarios might be.  
>     b. Do the concerns regarding the use of molnupiravir during pregnancy extend to the use
>         of molnupiravir in individuals of childbearing potential? If so, are there mitigation
>         strategies that should be considered?  
>  
> 2. __DISCUSSION:__ Please discuss the concern regarding the observed increased rate of viral
>    mutations involving the spike protein among participants receiving molnupiravir. In your
>    discussion, please comment on what, if any, additional risk mitigation strategies or limitations
>    on the authorized population could be considered. What monitoring strategies should be
>    considered to better understand and mitigate these concerns?  
>  
> 3. __VOTE:__ Do the known and potential benefits of molnupiravir outweigh the known and
>    potential risks of molnupiravir when used for the treatment of mild-moderate COVID-19 in
>    adult patients who are within 5 days of symptom onset and are at high risk of severe
>    COVID19, including hospitalization or death?  
>    a. If yes, please describe the appropriate authorized population such as risk factors for
>       disease progression and pregnant individuals. Please comment on the proposed risk
>       mitigation strategies and if additional risk mitigation strategies are needed.  
>    b. If no, please describe your reasons for concluding that the overall benefit-risk for
>       molnupiravir is not favorable for any population based on the data available at
>       this time.  

There are numerous documents to review here:

- Merck submitted a deck of 80 slides to use in its 
  presentation <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, which will be most of the basis for
  discussion at today's AMDAC.  
- Merck also submitted the formal briefing document of 68 pages &amp; an 
  addendum of 7 pages <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, which are the traditional formal way to
  present a case to the FDA AMDAC.  The committee members are expected to have read this
  ahead of time.  
- As is traditional in these matters, the FDA reanalyzed the data and came to its own
  conclusions, which will be compared with Merck's conclusions.  The FDA scientists
  submitted their own slide deck of 96 slides <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> (which
  includes the FDA introductory remarks for the meeting, as well as extensive toxicology
  studies).  
- There is also FDA's formal briefing document (44 pages), addendum (3 pages), and
  erratum (1 page) <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> that are the FDA's own version of
  what they think Merck _should_ have said in their formal submission document.  
  
The general idea is to compare the assertion's of Merck's scientists with those of the FDA
and see if they're broadly the same.  If so, then the results are compared against the
rules for EUA (or approval), and after some discussion, there's a vote over what actions
to recommend to the FDA administration.  


## Our trusty safari guides  

Hmm... normally Helen Branswell and Matt Herper of _STAT News_ live-blog these things, and
we use them as our trusty safari guides through the FDA/CDC jungle.  A quick trawl through
_STAT News_ comes up empty, though.  Maybe we're on our own today!  

Absent our usual safari guides, let's just take a look through the slide presentations
ourselves.  


## The Merck presentation  

- The drug is administered 2ce per day for 5 days at a dose of 800mg (in the form of 4
  capsules of 200mg each, so the dose can be titrated down, perhaps?).  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-5days.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-5days-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="218" alt="Merck: Reduction in viral load depends on early therapy" title="Merck: Reduction in viral load depends on early therapy" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Treatment must start within 5 days from symptoms.  That's empirically important, as
  shown here.  The reduction in viral load over time is dramatic for intervention before
  5 days past symptoms (left), but it is _an order of magnitude weaker_ for intervention
  after 5 days of symptoms (right). That means we _need_ to have a testing system which
  is widely available, cheap or free, and fast!  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-mechanism.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-mechanism-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="Merck: Molnupiravir prodrug mechanism of action" title="Merck: Molnupiravir prodrug mechanism of action" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Interestingly, it's a prodrug: your liver metabolizes it into the active form, then a
  kinse phosphorylates it 3 times, and it's ready to go.  When it gets incorporated into
  viral RNA, it can pair with either guanine or adenosine, resulting in many transition
  errors in the viral RNA.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-efficacy-variants.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-efficacy-variants-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="Merck: Efficacy across variants, and potency around 2&mu;M" title="Merck: Efficacy across variants, and potency around 2&mu;M" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Very gratifyingly, they did _in vitro_ tests against a number of variants including
  Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and others shown here.  The dose-response curve is
  encouraging: all variants reached 100% inhibition (good efficacy), and the EC50 for
  all looks to be around 2-3&mu;M (good potency).  This means that, whatever the
  variants are selecting for, it's unlikely to be  conveying immunity to molnupiravir.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-variants-enrolled.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-variants-enrolled-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Merck: Trial enrolled people with all circulating variants, including Delta" title="Merck: Trial enrolled people with all circulating variants, including Delta" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- They also checked that the enrolled subjects had a wide variety of circulating
  variants of the SARS-CoV2 virus.  As shown in the pie chart, the majority was the
  annoyingly infectious Delta strain, but 5 or so other strains put in noticeable
  appearances.  So any result is likely to be a broad result against SARS-CoV2, not just
  some particular strain.  
- There were 10 subject deaths during the trial, but 9 were in the placebo arm.  As a
  crude indication of safety, that's pretty good.  There were a _lot_ of other safety
  studies, both _in vitro_, in animals, and in surveillance of the trial population.
  The trial seemed pretty safe, with adverse events in the placebo arm about the same as
  treatment.  There is some worry about mutagenicity, particularly during organogenesis
  in pregnancy when messing with human RNA could be a bad idea.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-interim-cohort-efficacy.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-interim-cohort-efficacy-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="215" alt="Merck: Molnupiravir efficacy across interim cohort" title="Merck: Molnupiravir efficacy across interim cohort" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-full-cohort-efficacy.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-full-cohort-efficacy-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="213" alt="Merck: Molnupiravir efficacy across full cohort" title="Merck: Molnupiravir efficacy across full cohort" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- The initial stopping of the trial was based on an intermediate sample, and 
  [showed efficacy vs hospitalization of 48.3% (CL: 20.5% - 66.5%)](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/covid-treatments/#new-covid-19-therapeutics).  
- However, the entire dataset gives a more muted effect.  From the data shown here for the
  full cohort, we can reproduce our earlier calculation:  

  ```R
  > round(efficacyAndCL(709, 48, 699, 68), digits = 3)
	LCL   Eff   UCL 
  0.010 0.304 0.511 
  ```

  So that means molnupiravir has an efficacy against hospitalization of 30.4% (CL: 1.0% - 51.1%).
  That is both a dramatically lower median efficacy, as well as a wider confidence
  limit.  It's somewhat disappointing, especially in comparison with the robust results
  of paxlovid (though that's _also_ an intermediate analysis, I believe).  Still, it's
  statistically significant (the CL is -- _barely_ -- bounded above 0%, and a median 30%
  reduction in hospitalization is nothing to sneeze at!).  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-efficacy-from-virus.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-efficacy-from-virus-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="Merck: Molnupiravir efficacy mechanism is lowering amount of virus" title="Merck: Molnupiravir efficacy mechanism is lowering amount of virus" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- There is no doubt this improvement is due to virus clearance, since they measured
  SARS-CoV2 RNA at baseline, day 3, and day 5.  The reduction, as measured by log of
  mean difference and its 95% CL, is significant as shown here.  It's not just making
  people feel better, it's doing so by a mechanism that makes sense and is related to
  the disease process.  

A quick flip through the Merck briefing document reveals a lot more information, mostly
details.  But 2 things were striking to your humble Weekend Editor, surprised that they
were left out of the slides:  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-risk-reduction.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-risk-reduction-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="Merck: Risk reduction to constant baseline" title="Merck: Risk reduction to constant baseline" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- This graph shows the risk reduction in all patients, patients with some comorbidities,
  and the elder patients.  Note that the gray bars (risk in control group) go up as you
  move across, i.e., some groups have higher risks.  The green bars (risk in the treatment
  group) are all lower, and comparable.  Basically molnupiravir reduced the risk in all of
  those groups down to a baseline constant.  Any difference in counts among the group was
  _not_ because molnupiravir didn't work, but because it was facing a higher baseline
  risk.  That's good to know, that there aren't resistant subgroups.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-kaplan-meier.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-merck-kaplan-meier-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="353" alt="Merck: Molnupiravir Kaplan-Meier curve" title="Merck: Molnupiravir Kaplan-Meier curve" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- This is the _de rigeur_ Kaplan-Meier plot.  It shows hospitalizations versus time, for
  the treatment arm and control arm.  There's a log-rank statistic that shows this
  difference is significant, i.e., the spread between the 2 curves is real.  

That's&hellip; kind of convincing to me.  (Though keep in mind I skipped most of the
toxicity and mutagenicity arguments, so that might change my mind if I had the energy to
pay attention to it.)  


## The FDA presentation  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-fda-efficacy.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-fda-efficacy-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="236" alt="FDA: Molnupiravir efficacy vs hospitalization, intermediate and full cohorts" title="FDA: Molnupiravir efficacy vs hospitalization, intermediate and full cohorts" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Looking through the FDA slides, I'm struck by 3 aspects:
1. They came to largely the same conclusions about efficacy vs hospitalization.  For
   example, here are the hospitalization rates in treatment and control arms, for the
   interim and full cohorts.  They come to the same conclusion as Merck, down to the
   quantitative level.  This is what you want to see.  
2. The FDA spent a lot more time analyzing the safety data, as far as toxicity,
   mutagenicity, and reproductive effects.  If you want to read about the tox stuff that
   your humble Weekend Editor was too tired to wade through, this is where to jump in.  
3. The FDA spent a lot more time noodling over the exact patient population for whom
   molnupiravir should be authorized, in terms of both likelihood of benefit and type of
   risk (bone marrow, mutagenicity, reproductive abnormalities, requiring pregnancy
   tests&hellip;).  
   



## Discussion and voting  

Honestly, I skipped over the public comment and committee discussion periods.  After
almost 2 years, I'm getting COVID-19 fatigue.  

The voting took place around 4:45pm EST, which is cutting it fine since the meeting was
supposed to end at 5pm.  This is how these things always go, though: too much material for
the time, and too many opinionated people who all want to talk.  But their opinions are
highly trained, so it sometimes behooves us to listen.  Someday, we'll learn to allocate
the right amount of time to do so.  

They used a Zoom breakout room for voting, though I'm somewhat confused as to why.
Perhaps to show their votes to each other, but not the public?  Or perhaps they're just
tired of being in the public eye all day?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-vote.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-30-fda-molnupiravir-vote-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="FDA: Molnupiravir votes" title="FDA: Molnupiravir votes" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The result: 13 Yes, 10 No, and 0 Abstain.  Here's a fuzzy screen capture from the YouTube
broadcast, where you can just about make out the names of who voted which way (click to
embiggen).  If you watch the video broadcast near the end, each member had to state their
name and their vote and possibly some reasons.  So if you want to know who went which way,
that's where to look.  

The cautionary notes seemed to be around pregnant women, where some mutagenic effects
particularly during organogenesis in the fetus were likely (so not in the 1st trimester).
If you're a woman, a prescription for molnupiravir will be preceded by a pregnancy test.  

They also felt it should be limited to high-risk individuals (possibly mostly
unvaccinated or who had a suboptimal response to vaccination due to immune impairment),
because of some other tox effects (which I now regret skipping over!).  

Interestingly, given the looming hearings for paxlovid: if another orally available agent
with a better risk/benefit profile were to become available, then AMDAC thought the FDA
could reconsider approval.  So maybe molnupiravir gets approved for a couple weeks until
paxlovid?  That would be unusually dramatic; a better course would have been to hold the
paxlovid hearings _first._  

Weirdly, absolutely nobody said the word "paxlovid".  Maybe a legal reason for that?  

## The Weekend Conclusion  

Well, it looks like molnupiravir is recommended for EUA, though not with complete
enthusiasm.  The potential mutagenic effects in pregnancy really rang the AMDAC like a
bell.  Now let's see (a) what the FDA administration does, and (b) whether anybody
accelerates the paxlovid hearing!
