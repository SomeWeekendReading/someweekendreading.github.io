title: Hank Green, John Green, and the Great Asymmetry

Videos by "vlogbrothers" Hank &amp; John Green on the despair of the times led me to a WH
Auden poem and an essay by Stephen Jay Gould on the ease of destruction vs the triviality
of destruction.  Also, a quick stop to visit Virgil (not via _Inferno_).  Few can build;
anybody can burn.  


## Point: The Agony of Today

Way back in the before-times of 2019, John Green published a video letter to his brother
about feeling uncertain and afraid.  Note that this was _before the pandemic_, but even in
that time we could see the inequality, systemic racism, and persistent descent into
fascism.  It was chilling then, and even more so now.

John's title, "Uncertain and Afraid", is taken from a line in the WH Auden poem "September 1,
1939" <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> about the sense of foreboding at the enduring
Depression, the prospect of fascism, and the terrifying war hurtling predictably toward us:  

> I sit in one of the dives  
> On Fifty-second Street  
> Uncertain and afraid  
> As the clever hopes expire  
> Of a low dishonest decade:  

While we both agree this poem used to read like a relic of history preserved in
amber, we both now recognize it 80+ years later as chillingly familiar and frighteningly
applicable.  

We'll get to John's (and, for that matter, Hank's) resolution below.  But for the moment,
let's just sit with the uncomfortable feelings.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-22-greens-asymmetry-science-1.jpg" width="400" height="186" alt="Gould @ Science: The Great Asymmetry" title="Gould @ Science: The Great Asymmetry" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
They both reminded me of an old essay by Stephen Jay Gould, "The Great 
Asymmetry". <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  He was writing about the Terror that
followed the French Revolution, the invention of the guillotine, and the terrifying ease
with which people were executed _en masse._  

Among those executed was one of the pre-eminent French scientists of the day,
Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier on 1794-May-08.  Had he been able to hang on for a mere 3 months
longer, Robespierre would have fallen, the Terror ended, and he could have lived.
Lavoisier was a _big deal_ to world science of the time.  It took generations for a genius
like Lavoisier to be born, and a lifetime for him to be superbly educated to make
his many contributions.  But it took only seconds for a madman to order him executed.  As his
friend, the deity of French mathematics Joseph-Louis Lagrange put it:  

> It took them only an instant to cut off that head, but France may not produce another
> like it in a century.  

This is the "Great Asymmetry" of Gould's title: it is easier to destroy than to create.
It is also the nightmare that haunts me daily: the descent into fascism is _much_ easier than the
climb back out.  

As [Virgil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil) put it in the [_Aeneid_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid) (Book 6, v 126):  

> &hellip; facilis descensus Averno;  
> noctes atque dies patet atri ianua Ditis;  
> sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras,  
> hoc opus, hic labor est.  
> 
> The descent to hell is easy;  
> Night and day the door of black Dis is open.  
> But to retrace steps and escape into the air,  
> That is the task, this is the hard work.  

Genius builds over generations, but any fool can burn.  

(Hey, that almost looks good in Latin: _Genius per saecula aedificat; quilibet ineptus urere potest._)


## Counterpoint: We Are Not _Entirely_ Powerless  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ct94encmT0A" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
But what is to be done?  

For a momentary counterpoint, let's consult John's brother, Hank Green.  He wrote just
yesterday, here in 2022, the third year of the Great Pandemic.  While perhaps not a
_direct_ response to his John's video 3 years ago, it is nonetheless _&agrave; propos._  

He talks about a litter-strewn street near his home.  People buy snacks at a convenience
store and, predictably, litter.  This could have been a screed about a lack of social
responsibility, lack of respect for common spaces, or just general selfish stupidity.  And
all that's there, to a degree; Hank feels appropriate anger.  

But then he comes to a realization: this isn't an _absolute_ problem of trash levels, it's
a _rate_ problem.  It only takes one person dropping 1 piece of trash a day to have 30
pieces of trash after a month.  That's still just 1 person littering, though.  The
paradox:  

> Almost no one litters.  But the street is covered with trash.  

The lack, of course, is other people _picking up the trash._ If a couple people each pick
up 2 pieces of trash a day, then their will dominates the situation and the street is
clean after 10 days (1 trash/day in - 4 trash/day out = -3 trash/day).  

> A street with no litter is not one that never gets littered on.  It's a street where the
> _rate_ of people dropping trash is lower than the _rate_ of people picking up trash.  

So basically the person littering is only half the problem.  The other half is the rest of
us, who _could_ clean up&hellip; but don't.  And it doesn't take a lot of us: just a few
people picking up can overwhelm the few people who litter.  

Real problems are, of course, more complex than picking up trash.  But we need to police
our common space, cleaning up messes (including our own messes) _faster_ than new messes
can be generated.  Sometimes even doing a _little_ thing helps.  You don't have to do it
all, as the Talmud reminds us in
[_Pirkei Avot_ 2:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.16?ven=Mishnah_Yomit_by_Dr._Joshua_Kulp&vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en):  

> It is not your duty to finish the work, but neither are you at liberty to neglect
> it&hellip;  

I couldn't help but associate this with another Auden poem, "In memory of Sigmund 
Freud". <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  While I'm not a fan of Freud, I admire Auden's
love for the image of Freud attempting to do good and ease pain, in a pain-filled world
(emphasis added):  

> When there are so many we shall have to mourn,  
> when grief has been made so public, and exposed  
> to the critique of a whole epoch  
> the frailty of our conscience and anguish,  
>  
> of whom shall we speak? For every day they die  
> among us, __those who were doing us some good__,  
> __who knew it was never enough but__  
> __hoped to improve a little by living.__  

Today we have so many dead to mourn that we should speak frequently of those who attempted
to do good.  Freud didn't fix the world, but tried to make it a _little_ better for each
patient.  He tried to help them get free of their past, and be able to engage their future
(emphasis added):  

> He wasn't clever at all: he merely told  
> the unhappy Present to recite the Past  
> like a poetry lesson till sooner  
> or later it faltered at the line where  
>  
> long ago the accusations had begun,  
> and suddenly knew by whom it had been judged,  
> how rich life had been and how silly,  
> and was __life-forgiven and more humble,__  
>  
> __able to approach the Future as a friend__  
> __without a wardrobe of excuses, without__  
> __a set mask of rectitude or an__   
> __embarrassing over-familiar gesture.__  

John then returns to the rest of Auden's "September 1, 1939" to
[dig for hope, however deeply it may be buried]({{ site.baseurl }}/spirit-of-complicated-people/).
Auden says something similar &ndash; he can't fix the world, but he can "undo the folded lie"
and affirm the truths of the Just (emphases added):

> All I have is a voice  
> To __undo the folded lie,__  
> The romantic lie in the brain  
> Of the sensual man-in-the-street  
> And __the lie of Authority__  
> Whose buildings grope the sky:  
> There is no such thing as the State  
> And no one exists alone;  
> Hunger allows no choice  
> To the citizen or the police;  
> __We must love one another or die.__  
>  
> Defenceless under the night  
> Our world in stupor lies;  
> Yet, dotted everywhere,  
> __Ironic points of light  
> Flash out wherever the Just  
> Exchange their messages:  
> May I, composed like them  
> Of Eros and of dust,  
> Beleaguered by the same  
> Negation and despair,  
> Show an affirming flame.__  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

I'm not entirely sure how I can "show an affirming flame" as a point of light among the
communications of the Just.  At least, not strongly enough to overcome the right-wing
fanatics who want to watch the world burn.  

But, like Hank picking up trash, I look for opportunities.
