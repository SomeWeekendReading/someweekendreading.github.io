Times are difficult, here in the 3rd year of a global pandemic that drags on and on,
because people just _cannot_ grasp the importance of public health measures and
vaccination.  Anything that sustains our spirit and our belief in a good core of human
nature is important.  So why am I looking at dog statues on bridges in Prague?  


## Restoring faith in human nature  

The world just now is full of the ignorant and the fascist, for some reason.  Anything
that can restore at least _some_ of my faith in human nature is welcome.  

On the other hand: avoiding things that destroy my faith in human nature is a survival
tactic for me, for many years now.  That's why I don't have social media accounts: no
Bookfacery, no Twittage, no Instagrammaton, no TackyTonk, no WhatsOpera&hellip; none of
that.  I have very little patience with performative stupidity (unless done as satire and
done well, by somebody like Monty Python).  

But there _are_, occasionally, interesting people who _do_ use social media, and I'd like
to know what they think.  Other people whom I respect (for reasons _other_ than their
social media hygiene) trawl through the social media sewers and post interesting bits they
find on their blogs.  _That_ I will read, occasionally dipping into a Twitter thread
blessed by tasteful people I trust.  (But not Facebook: I won't touch Facebook, not even
with the legendary Ten Foot Pole of Touching.  Now, I might _stab_ corporate Facebook using a ten foot
[pikestaff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_(weapon)) with a venom tip&hellip; but
lacking the context for medieval anti-cavalry weapons, that is unlikely to matter.  Yes, I
am a cranky old man.  How are you only just realizing this _now?_ Have I not provided you
with sufficient evidence for that conclusion already?!)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-dog-touched.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-dog-touched-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="472" alt="Jan Nepomuk: dog touched" title="Jan Nepomuk: dog touched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
And so it is today: somebody or other pointed me at somebody else or other, who tweeted a photo
showing a more or less late medieval European soldier and his loyal dog.  The dog had been
burnished shiny by passers-by who also wanted to pet the dog (click to embiggen, for most
of these images).  

Isn't it nice that, even in a pandemic and the revenance of fascism, people want to do
a basic kindness, like petting a dog?  

Well&hellip; yes, but&hellip;  I have questions.  


## Digging deeper  

I _always_ have questions.  Here are just the top few:  
- Where is this sculpture, who put it there, and why?  
- Why a soldier?  This soldier has a scallop on his brassard which indicates service in
  a pilgrimage and some affiliation with St James the Greater, patron of Spain.  So which
  conflict was he in and what should I think about this soldier?  
- Who are all those people behind the soldier, kneeling on something like steps, with
  their hands upraised?  
- Who is the woman to the right, talking into a grille of some sort?  Why can't we see
  anything other than the legs of the person on the other side of the grille?  
- What's with the weird architecture: elaborate curtain on the upper right like a stage
  setting (memory theatre of the soldier's memories?), and elaborately sculpted columns in
  the style of Corinth with _spears_ around the base?  
- Why is the soldier holding what almost looks like a Roman _pilum_, a short spear for
  close-in fighting?  This is not normally an implement of dog-petting (unless I've been
  doing it wrong my whole life, and the dogs have just been really forgiving of my lapse
  in petting without weapons?).  
- If the soldier is ready to fight with the weapon he's holding, then why is he barefoot?!  
  
So many, _many_ questions.  


## Okay, start with _where_  

Let's start with the simplest of factual questions that we can actually answer: where was
this photograph taken?  I despair of looking at the
[EXIF properties of the JPG image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif), since
people quite regularly monkey with those.  (I'm slightly disappointed nobody has yet tried
to convince me their image was taken on Mars.  Get on that, will you?)

However, a few minutes of quality time with [Google Lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lens)
exhumed a boatload of similar (even near-identical) images, complete with explanations of who,
what, when, where, and why.  It turns out this is a relief sculpture at the base of a
statue on the [Charles Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge) built in 1357
over the [Vltava River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vltava) in Prague, the capital of the
Czech Republic.  For 500 years, it was the only way to cross the river with a horse and
carriage/cart, so all the streets in Prague sort of funnel traffic toward the bridge.  It
was originally called "the bridge", since it was the only one; you only need names when
you have 2 or more of something.  (Practical folk, the residents of Prague.)  

Interesting enough, but more to the point: the 40 statues on the bridge (actually 39 + one
cross with 5 stars) are a bit of a tourist attraction, hence the fame of photos like
this.  One very helpful Prague tourist site, _LivingPrague_, explained a great many
fascinating and occasionally disturbing details. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  The
pictures reproduced here are from _LivingPrague_, and some clearer versions from 
_My Modern Met_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>.  The video here is also kind of interesting: it
shows the late medieval construction techniques for building such a bridge: largely with
nothing but human and animal muscle power, augmented by clever leverage and wheels.  

Legend says construction of this bridge was started personally by 
[Emperor Charles IV, king of Bohemia and later Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IV,_Holy_Roman_Emperor)
at 5:31am on 1357-Jul-09, because in the notation of the day (1357 9/7 5:31) the numbers
formed a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).  Weird cat, that Charles 
ne&eacute; Wenceslaus.  

_That_ is your fair warning that the going is about to get weird. _Deeply_ weird.  


## Fine, but why a dog?  And what else is there?  

Why couldn't it have been a duck instead of a dog?  I had a  perfectly good 
[Marx Brothers gag all ready to go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_a_Duck%3F).
It was just sitting _right there_, and now it's going to waste!  Sigh.  

Ok, no duck.  But why a dog?  And what else is going on here?  As it turns out, rather a _lot._  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-queen-and-saint-touched.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-queen-and-saint-touched-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="465" alt="Jan Nepomuk: Queen and saint touched" title="Jan Nepomuk: Queen and saint touched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The image of the soldier, his highly polished dog, and the fascinating other stuff is at
the base of a statue (which we'll look at in a minute).  If you move just a meter or two
to the right, you see this relief instead.  Something weird, disturbing, dark, and violent
is happening here:  
- Storm clouds are gathering in the upper left, perhaps as a sign of divine displeasure.  
- A bunch of armored soldiers, armed with spears or pikes and coming out from a
  portcullis, are on a bridge.   
- They appear to be forcibly throwing someone off the bridge, upside-down.  It's unlikely
  to be a friendly dunking prank at some medieval cosplay fraternity.  (Please don't tell
  me there actually _are_ medieval cosplay fraternities; I'd really rather not know that.)  
- In the foreground, a well-dressed woman with coiffed hair (likely a noble), is watching
  under what appear to be the dual influences of a cherub to her left and another soldier
  on her right.  
- The soldier has drawn his sword in his right hand, and is reaching out toward her with
  his left, so this is an image of compulsion.  
- The image is burnished by people touching it in 2 places: the woman's back, and the poor
  victim being tossed athwart the bridge (so _much_ so that he's almost worn smooth).  
  
What in the _world?!_  Not so peaceful as a picture of some guy petting his dog any more,
is it?  

Maybe the dog isn't the main point being made here.  


## Jan Nepomuk  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-in-river.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-in-river-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Jan Nepomuk: supine in river" title="Jan Nepomuk: supine in river" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Meet [Jan Nepomuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Nepomuk) (Jan Nepomuck&yacute;, first
name pronounced with a Y sound, something like "Yahn"), c1345 &ndash; 1393-Mar-20, patron
saint of Bohemia
and (somewhat ironically) protector from drowning.  

Whenever a death date is given like that with _extreme_ precision, you should expect a
gory, detailed story of martyrdom.  And so it is here.  The image depicts our man Jan
surrounded by his trademark 5 stars, in repose at the bottom of the Vlatava River, having
drowned.  Under &ndash; can you guess? &ndash; this very bridge.  

While there are plenty of details of his life, they are, in keeping with tradition either
somewhat lost, or confused with _another_ Jan who lived about the same time, or just the
stuff of legend.  This is normal, so let's consider his legend.  He came from a village
called Pomuk, which later merged with a nearby village and became known as Nepomuk.  So
that's not a surname, it just says he's "that guy Jan, you know, the one from the village
of Nepomuk?"  

He became a priest, Catholic of course, and apparently advanced to relatively high degree.
That meant he was a member of one hierarchy (Gr _hieros_ + _arkhein_ = holy/priestly rulers)
competing against another hierarchy, the aristocracy and royals.  Funny thing about hierarchies:
they do _not_ play well with others.  What they _do_ is demand submission to dominance
displays.  Accounts vary, but one of a couple things happened:  
1. Jan Nepomuk somehow got caught in the gears of the machine of conflict between church
   and state. King Wenceslas IV wanted to appoint bishops himself, while the Catholic
   hierarchy had other ideas.  So, a conflict of political power.  
2. Jan Nepomuk was hearing the confession of Queen Sophia, and afterwards the jealous King
   Wenceslas wanted to know what his wife said.  The Seal of the Confessional meant
   absolute secrecy, so&hellip; a conflict with a very powerful, very jealous, very
   enraged husband.  

Situation number 2 is what's depicted in the reliefs above.  The woman in
the background of the first relief is speaking into the grille in a confessional.  The
priest on the other side, who in keeping with anonymity cannot be seen totally, is Jan
Nepomuk.  What's the solider doing there?  Possibly guarding the queen.  Possibly a
foreshadowing of royal might about to get stabby with Jan Nepomuk.  Possibly a soldier
remembering the confession, seeking forgiveness.  Possibly a symbol that even people who
do bad things like drowning saints, might have a good streak they show with dogs.
Possibly&hellip; all sorts of things.  

The other relief shows the result: Wenceslas IV ordered Jan Nepomuk tortured and executed.
(Why bother torturing somebody you're going to kill anyway?  Why not just kill them, and
save time?  If you must exhibit a tortured body as a deterrent to others, why not just
kill first and then mutilate at leisure?  I seem to be going down the path here of how to
be a More Efficient Psychopath, so it seems like this is maybe a good place to stop.  But
I do not _understand._)  

After being tortured, the soldiers are dumping him into the Vltava to drown. The
solider in the foreground is forcing Queen Sophia to watch, at swordpoint.  Torture would
likely have included the rack, which would have disjointed arms and legs from their
sockets, torn muscle and tendon, and generally left no use of limbs to the victim.
Swimming would be out of the question, and drowning a certainty.  


## Umm&hellip; happy dog story?  

Well, that went dark fast.  

I mean, I just wanted to a feel-good story about a guy petting a dog.  And I got _this_ instead?!  

Sure, it's Middle Ages MittelEuropa, but still&hellip; why can't we have a nice little
story about how people like to pet dogs?  Well&hellip; people?  They're _complicated._  


## So&hellip; why the shiny spots?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-eastman-mit.jpg" width="400" height="380" alt="George Eastman relief @ MIT: Nose rubbed shiny for good luck on physics exams" title="George Eastman relief @ MIT: Nose rubbed shiny for good luck on physics exams" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
People apparently like to rub statues for good luck.  

At MIT, there's a relief of [George Eastman (think Eastman Kodak) where students about to enter a physics lecture hall used to rub the nose for good luck on exams](https://alum.mit.edu/slice/george-eastmans-nose-available-rubbing).  (Rumor had it that there was also a relief of Ellen Swallow Richards, where the undergrads would rub her breasts for good luck; one hopes that particular instance has fallen by the wayside nowadays.)  I never quite got idea of rubbing statues, but apparently it's a thing.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-being-touched.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-being-touched-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="Jan Nepomuk: touched by tourists" title="Jan Nepomuk: touched by tourists" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Also apparently, this whole horrific scene has somehow become a tourist attraction.  Maybe
that's good, rehabilitating ugly things in the past?  Tour guides lead people to the
bridge, which I admit is quite scenic and has quite a bit of nice artwork.  Then they tell
the tourists that touching St Jan or the Queen Sophia either brings good luck, or ensures
one will return to Prague, or&hellip; _something_.  

Also, people like dogs, so they pet the dog too, because apparently it's easier to reach
the dog than the saint or the queen.  Shown here is a view of 2 tourists doing exactly
that, with a view of the whole statue above the plaques.  (Did you remember we've thus far
only been talking about 2 minor plaques at the bottom, not the main statue?  Surprise!)  

Ok, that's slightly amusing.  People turn a martyrdom into a happy petition for good
luck.  I can work with that, though I was hoping for a simple story about petting dogs.  

But nothing is _ever_ allowed to be simple, it seems.  


## How long has _that_ been going on?  

The statue was erected about 300 years after the martyrdom, so call it 1683 or so.  For
how much of the intervening 3+ centuries since then until today have people been rubbing
the saint, the queen, and the dog here, hoping for good luck and return tickets?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-1860.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-1860-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="499" alt="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 1860, untouched" title="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 1860, untouched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-1996.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-1996-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="582" alt="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 1996, only saint touched" title="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 1996, only saint touched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-2020.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-2020-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="626" alt="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 2020, saint, queen, and dog touched" title="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 2020, saint, queen, and dog touched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Not, as it happens, for very long.  

The first photo here shows the statue in 1860, complete with the very baroque 5 stars said
to have arisen from the river when the saint was killed.  Note there are _no_ polished
spots from handsy tourists.  Just a couple of dull brown reliefs.  (Also note the odd
mixture of 6-point stars around his head and 5-point stars at his feet.  What's going on
there?  And it's too bad the 5-pointers at his feet are only stellated to one level;
it would have been cool to try to represent the full fractal here.  What?  Nerds like
symbolism too, you know.)  

The middle one was taken in 1996, and shows exactly _one_ shiny spot, on the saint
himself.  For a very Catholic environment, making an appeal to the saint makes pretty good
sense.  Nobody was much interested in the queen or the dog, though.  

Finally, the bottom picture from 2020 shows 3 burnished spots: saint, queen, and dog.  So
it looks like the dog-polishing tourists started sometime in the last 25 years.  That
matches up with the 1989 Velvet Revolution, after which tourism became serious.  

In this bottom photo, I can just about make out the Latin inscription:  

> DIVO IOANNI  
> NEPOMUCENO  
> ANNO MCCCLXXXIII  
> EX HOC PONTE  
> DEIECTO  
>  
> EREXIT  
> MATHIAS LB  
> DE WUNSCHWITZ  
> ANNO MDCLXXXIII  

Which, not to make my long-ago Latin tutors spin _too_ fast in their graves, might be
rendered (thanks to commenter M 2ler for advice on the dative case and the verb
_deiicio_):  

> To the Divine Jan  
> of Nepomuk  
> in the year 1383 _(NB: sources agree should be 1393)_  
> from this bridge  
> cast down  
>  
> Erected by  
> Mathias LB  
> of Wunschwitz  
> in the year 1683  

That matches what we know: the statue was built in 1683 by one Jan Brokoff, based on a
model by Matthias Rauchmiller.  (So I don't know what the "LB" after Mathias means?)
Interestingly, this is well _before_ Jan Nepomuk was beatified in 1721 or canonized
in 1729.  

I'm really tempted to coin the neologism "depontificated" (thrown over the bridge) in
parallel to "defenestrated" (thrown out the window).  But I'm kind of starting to
like old Jan Nepomuk, so let's not make too much fun of the occasion of his death.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

As I'm fond of telling students: interpretation is an _active choice_ on your part, and
one you _must_ make lest circumstances force an unsavory choice upon you.  

So what's our active choice here?  

On the one hand, we can be ["realists"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism-intl-relations/)
about this story.  Or on the other hand, we can choose to do nothing for
interpretation.  But if I choose nothing, my pessimistic (and usually depressed) mind will
drift toward the dark.  No, it's not about good people wanting to pet dogs.  It's about
jealous husbands, secrecy, authoritarian tyrrany, military occupation, state-authorized
torture, political murder, and&hellip; look, I'm just gonna just stop there, ok?  

On the gripping hand: it's a story about persistence in keeping a promise (the seal of
the confessional), about revering loyal people even centuries afterward, and about
turning a horrible historical event into a hope for good luck.  

And, in spite of all the humans and their crappy behavior, it's _also_ about a loyal dog who
inspires people to pet him or her affectionately.  People are complicated, but that dog
loves some of them anyway.  

It's hard to live up to the example of a saint, particularly one who's been martyred.  But
maybe we can _start_ by at least trying to live up to the example of the dog?
