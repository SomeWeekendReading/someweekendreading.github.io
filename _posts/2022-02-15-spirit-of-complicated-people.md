The times are difficult, now in the 3rd year of a global pandemic that drags on and on,
because people just _cannot_ grasp the importance of public health measures and
vaccination.  Anything that sustains our spirit and our belief in a good core to human
nature is important.  So why am I looking at dog statues on bridges in Prague?  


## Restoring faith in human nature  

The world just now is full of the ignorant and the fascist, for some reason.  Anything
that can restore at least _some_ of my faith in human nature is welcome.  

On the other hand: avoiding things that destroy my faith in human nature is a survival
tactic for me, for many years now.  That's why I don't have social media accounts: no
Bookfacery, no Twittage, no Instagrammaton, no TackyTank, no WhatsOpera&hellip; none of
that.  I have very little patience with performative stupidity (unless done as satire and
done well, by somebody like Monty Python).  

But there _are_, occasionally, interesting people who _do_ use social media.  Other people
whom I respect (for reasons _other_ than their social media hygiene) trawl through the
social media sewers and post interesting bits they find on their blogs.  _That_ I will
read, occasionally dipping into a Twitter thread blessed by tasteful people I trust.  (But
not Facebook: I won't touch Facebook, not even with the legendary ten foot Pole of Touching.
Now, I might _stab_ Facebook with a ten foot
[pikestaff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_(weapon)) with a venom tip&hellip; but
lacking the context for medieval anti-cavalry weapons, that is unlikely to matter.  Yes, I
am a cranky old man.  How are you only just realizing this _now?_ Have I not provided you
with sufficient evidence for that conclusion already?!)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-dog-touched.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-dog-touched-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Jan Nepomuk: dog touched" title="Jan Nepomuk: dog touched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
And so it is today: somebody or other pointed me at somebody else or other, who a photo
showing a more or less late European medieval soldier and his loyal dog, which had been
burnhished shiny by passers-by who also wanted to pet the dog (click to embiggen).  

Isn't it nice that, even in a pandemic and the revenance of fascism that people want to do
basic kindnesses, like petting a dog?  

Well&hellip; yes, but&hellip;  I have questions.  


## Digging deeper  

I _always_ have questions.  Here are just the top few:  
- Where is this sculpture, who put it there, and why?  
- Why a soldier?  This soldier has a scallop on his brassard which indicates service in
  Spain, so which conflict was that and what should I think about this soldier?  
- Who are all those people behind the soldier, kneeling on something like steps, with
  their hands upraised?  
- Who is the woman to the right, talking into a grille of some sort?  Why can't we see
  anything other than the legs of the person on the other side of the grille?  
- What's with the weird architecture: elaborate curtain on the upper right, and elaborately
  sculpted columns in the style of Corinth with _spears_ around the base?  
- Why is the soldier holding what almost looks like a Roman _pilum_, a short spear for
  close-in fighting?  This is not normally an implement of dog-petting (unless I've been
  doing it wrong my whole life, and the dogs have just been really forgiving of my lapse
  in petting without weapons?)  
  
So many, _many_ questions.  


## Okay, start with _where_  

Let's start with the simplest of factual questions that we can actually answer: where was
this photograph taken?  I despair of looking at the
[EXIF properties of the JPG image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif), since
people quite regularly mess with those.  (I'm slightly disappointed nobody has yet tried
to convince me their image was taken on Mars.  Get on that, will you?)

However, a few minutes of quality time with [Google Lens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lens)
exhumed a boatload of similar (near-identical) images, complete with explanations of who,
what, when, where, and why.  It turns out this is a relief sculpture at the base of a
statue on the [Charles Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bridge) built in 1357
over the [Vltava River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vltava) in Prague, capital of the
Czech Republic.  For 500 years, it was the only way to cross the river with a horse and
carriage/cart, so all the streets in Prague sort of funnel traffic toward the bridge.  

Interesting enough, but more to the point: the 40 statues on the bridge (actually 39 + one
cross with 5 stars) are a bit of a tourist attraction, hence the fame of photos like
this.  One very helpful Prague tourist site, _LivingPrague_, explained a great man
fascinating and occasionally disturbing details. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  The
pictures reproduced here are from _LivingPrague_.  

Legend says construction was started personally by 
[Emperor Charles IV, king of Bohemia and later Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_IV,_Holy_Roman_Emperor)
at 5:31am on 1357-Jul-09, because in the notation of the day (1357 9/7 5:31) the numbers
formed a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).  Weird cat, that Charles 
ne&eacute; Wenceslaus.  This is your fair warning that the going is about to get weird.
_Deeply_ weird.  


## Fine, but why a dog?  And what else is there?  

Why couldn't it have been a duck instead of a dog?  I had a  perfectly good 
[Marx Brothers gag all ready to go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_a_Duck%3F).
It was sitting _right there_, and now it's going to waste!  Sigh.  

Ok, no duck.  But why a dog?  And what else is going on here?  As it turns out, rather a _lot._  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-queen-and-saint-touched.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-nepomuk-people-queen-and-saint-touched-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="231" alt="Jan Nepomuk: Queen and saint touched" title="Jan Nepomuk: Queen and saint touched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The image of the soldier, his highly polished dog, and the fascinating other stuff is at
the base of a statue (which we'll look at in a minute).  If you move just a meter or two
to the right, you see this.  Something weird, disturbing, dark, and violent is happening
here:  
- A bunch of armored soldiers, armed with spears or pikes, are on a bridge.  
- They appear to be forcibly throwing someone off the bridge, upside-down.  It's unlikely
  to be a friendly dunking.  
- In the foreground, a well-dressed woman with coiffed hair (likely a noble), is watching
  under what appear to be the dual influences of a cherub to her left and another soldier
  on her right.  
- The soldier has drawn his sword in his right hand, and is reaching out toward her with
  his left, so this is an image of compulsion.  
- The image is burnished by people touching it in 2 places: the woman's back, and the poor
  victim being tossed athwart the bridge (so _much_ that he's almost worn smooth).  
  
What in the _world?!_  Not so peaceful as a picture of some guy petting his dog any more,
is it?  

Maybe the dog isn't the main point being made here.  


## Jan Nepomuk  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-in-river.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-in-river-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Jan Nepomuk: supine in river" title="Jan Nepomuk: supine in river" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Meet [Jan Nepomuk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_of_Nepomuk) (first name pronounced
with a Y sound, something like "Yahn"), c1345 &ndash; 1393-Mar-20, patron saint of Bohemia
and (somewhat ironically) protector from drowning.  

Whenever a death date is given like that with _extreme_ precision, you should expect a
gory, detailed story of martyrdom.  And so it is here.  The image depicts our man Jan
surrounded by his trademark 5 stars, in repose at the bottom of the Vlatava River, having
drowned.  Under &ndash; can you guess? &ndash; this very bridge.  

While there is plenty of detail of his life, they are in keeping with tradition either
somewhat lost, or confused with _another_ Jan who lived about the same time, or just the
stuff of legend.  This is normal, so let's consider his legend.  He came from a village
called Pomuk, which later merged with a nearby villag and became known as Nepomuk.  So
that's not a surname, it just says he's "that guy Jan, you know, the one from the village
of Nepomuk?"  

He became a priest, Catholic of course, and apparently advanced to relatively high degree.
That means he's a member of one hierarchy (Gr _hieros_ + _arkhein_ = holy/priestly rulers)
competing against another hierarchy, the aristocracy and royals.  Funny thing about hierarchies:
they do _not_ play well with others.  What they _do_ is demand submission.  Accounts vary,
but one of a couple things happened:  
1. Jan Nepomuk got caught in the gears of the machine of conflict between church and state
   King Wenceslas IV wanted to appoint bishops himself, while the Catholic
   hierarchy had other ideas.  So, a conflict of political power.  
2. Jan Nepomuk was hearing the confession of Queen Sophia, and afterwards the jealous King
   wanted to know what his wife said.  The Seal of the Confessional meant absolute secrecy,
   so&hellip; a conflict with a very powerful, very jealous husband.  

Situation number 2 is what's depicted in the reliefs above.  The woman in
the background speaking into the grille is in a confessional.  The priest on the other
side, who in keeping with anonymity cannot be seen totally, is Jan Nepomuk.  What's the
solider doing there?  Possibly guarding the queen.  Possibly a foreshadowing of royal
might about to get stabby with Jan Nepomuk.  Possibly a soldier remembering the
confession, seeking forgiveness.  Possibly a symbol that even people who do bad things
like drowning saints, might have a good streak they show with dogs.  Possibly.  

The other relief shows the result: Wenceslas IV ordered Jan Nepomuk tortured and
executed.  (Why bother torturing somebody you're going to kill anyway?  Why not just kill
them, and save time?  If you have to exhibit a tortured body as a deterrent to others, why
not just kill first and then mutilate?  I'm going down the path here of how to be a More
Efficient Psychopath, so it seems like this is a good place to stop.  But I do not
understand.)  

After being tortured, the soldiers are dumping him into the Vltava to drown and the
solider in the foreground is forcing Queen Sophia to watch, at swordpoint.  Torture would
likely have included the rack, which would have disjointed arms and legs from their
sockets, torn muscle and tendon, and generally left no use of limbs to the victim.
Swimming would be out of the quesiton, and drowning a certainty.  

Well, that got dark fast.  

I mean, I just wanted to feel good about a guy petting a dog.  And I got this?!  

Sure, it's Middle Ages MittelEuropa, but still&hellip; why can't we have a nice little
story about how people like to pet dogs?  Well, people&hellip; they're _complicated._  


## So&hellip; why the shiny spots?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-being-touched.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-being-touched-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="Jan Nepomuk: touched by tourists" title="Jan Nepomuk: touched by tourists" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Apparently this whole horrific scene has become a tourist attraction.  Maybe that's good,
rehabilitating ugly things in the past?  Tour guides lead people to the bridge, which I
admit is quite scenic and has quite a bit of artwork.  Then they tell the tourists that
touching St Jan or the queen either brings good luck or ensures one will return to
Prague.  Also, people like dogs, so they pet the dog because apparently it's easier to
reach.  Shown here is a view of 2 tourists doing exactly that, with a view of the whole
statue above the plaques.  (Did you remember we've thus far only been talking about 2
minor plaques at the bottom, not the main statue?  Surprise!)  

Ok, that's slightly amusing.  People turn a martyrdom into a happy petition for good
luck.  I can work with that, though I was hoping for a simple story about petting dogs.
But nothing is _ever_ allowed to be simple, it seems.  

## How long has that been going on?  

The statue was erected about 300 years after the martyrdom, so call it 1683 or so.  For
how much of the intervening 3+ centuries have people been rubbing saint, queen, and dog
here hoping for good luck and return tickets?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-1860.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-1860-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="499" alt="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 1860, untouched" title="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 1860, untouched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-1996.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-1996-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="582" alt="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 1996, only saint touched" title="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 1996, only saint touched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-2020.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-15-spirit-of-complicated-people-nepomuk-2020-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="626" alt="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 2020, saint, queen, and dog touched" title="Jan Nepomuk: statue in 2020, saint, queen, and dog touched" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Not, as it happens, for very long.  

The first photo here shows the statue in 1860, complete with the very baroque 5 stars said
to have arisen from the river when the saint was killed.  Note there are _no_ polished
spots from handsy tourists.  

The middle one was taken in 1996, and shows exactly _one_ shiny spot, on the saint
himself.  For a very Catholic environment, making an appeal to the saint makes pretty good
sense.  Nobody was much interested in the queen or the dog, though.  

Finally, the bottom picture from 2020 shows 3 burnished spots: saint, queen, and dog.  So
it looks like the dog-polishing tourists started sometime in the last 25 years.  

In this bottom photo, I can just about make out the Latin inscription:  

> DIVO IOANNI  
> NEPOMUCENO  
> Anno MCCCLXXXIII  
> EX HOC PONTE  
> DEIECTO \
>  
> EREXIT  
> MATHIAS LB  
> DE WUNSCHWITZ  
> ANNO MDCLXXXXIII  

Which, not to make my long-ago Latin tutors spin too fast in their graves, might be
rendered:  

> The Divine Jan  
> of Nepomuk  
> in the year 1383 (NB: sources agree should be 1393)  
> defeated (Or: martyred, killed?)  
>  
> Erected by  
> Mathias LB  
> of Wunschwitz  
> in the year 1693  

I'm really tempted to coin the neologism "depontificated" (thrown over the bridge) in
parallel to "defenestrated" (thrown out the window)&hellip; but I'm starting to kind of
like old Jan Nepomuk, so let's not make too much fun of the occasion of his death.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

As I'm fond of telling students: interpretation is an _active choice_ on your part, and
one you _must_ make.  

So what's our active choice here?  

If I choose nothing, my pessimistic and usually depressed mind will drift toward the
dark.  No, it's not about good people wanting to pet dogs.  It's about jealous husbands,
secrecy, authoritarian tyrrany, military occupation, torture, murder, and&hellip; look,
I'm gonna just stop there, ok?  

On the other tentacle: it's a story about persistence in keeping a promise (the seal of
the confessional), about revering people who are loyal for centuries afterward, about
turning a horrible occasion into a hope for good luck.  

And, in spite of all the humans and their crappy behavior, it's about a loyal dog who
inspires people to pet him affectionately.  

It's hard to live up to the example of a saint, particularly one who's been martyred.  But
maybe we can _start_ by trying to live up to the example of the dog?
