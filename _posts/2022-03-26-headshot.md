[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) to put a headshot up on this
crummy little blog that nobody reads (CLBTNR).  No idea why, but&hellip;  


## &Gammad;&Tau;&Phi;?!  

Why in the world would you care what I _look_ like?!  
- When I was young, I looked like a sort of dumpy nerd whos attractiveness was maybe in the
  bottom tertile.  
- Now I look like an old guy who _used_ to look like that.  

Why would you want to see that?  Even _I_ don't want to see that.  

Still&hellip; never let it be said that I don't try to accomodate questions.  Of course,
the hinkier the question, the more passive-aggressive the answer is likely to be,
but&hellip; I remind you that you are here of your own free will.

Herewith the now-canonical Weekend Headshot (click to embiggen).  

Yes, that's really me.  Last December, for a variety of reasons too complex and personal
to bother with, I got a cranial MRI.  (Note to MRI technicians: do _not_ ask, just before
cramming a patient into a confined space, "You're not claustrophobic, are you?")  

Turns out I appear to be ok, or as ok as I ever am.  I asked for some images, so they
burned me a DVD.  Unfortunately, it was a software DVD with a _Windows_ application, of
all things, to view the images.  That was less than completely helpful!

As you can see, the Weekend Publisher was&hellip; _unimpressed._  

However, a friend who also happens to be an academic radiologist pointed me at the Horos
Project <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> and their open-source Mac viewer of
[DICOM-format images](https://www.dicomstandard.org/).  I extracted an MP4 from one of
the series (probably neurological nonsense, but it looked sort of like a head, so I went
with it), and then converted that to a 2-second animated GIF for browser
interoperability (and to strip of any inconvenient EXIF information).  

Can I get this pic on my passport?
