[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) to put a headshot up on this
crummy little blog that nobody reads (CLBTNR).  No idea why, but&hellip;  


## &Gammad;&Tau;&Phi;?!  

Why in the world would you care what I _look_ like?!  
- When I was young, I looked like a sort of dumpy nerd, of basically blobular physique,
  whose attractiveness was maybe in the bottom tertile.  
- Now I look like an old guy who _used_ to look like that.  

Why would you want to see that?  Even _I_ don't want to see that.  

Still&hellip; never let it be said that I don't try to accomodate questions.  Of course,
the hinkier the question, the more passive-aggressive the answer is likely to be,
but&hellip; I remind you that you are here of your own free will.

Herewith the now-canonical Weekend Headshot (click to embiggen).  

Yes, that's really me.  Last December, for a variety of reasons too complex and personal
to bother with, I got a cranial MRI.  (__Note to MRI technicians:__ do _not_ ask, just before
cramming a patient into a confined space, "You're not claustrophobic, are you?"  The power
of suggestion is a real thing.)  

Turns out, by some happy accident, I appear to be ok (or at least as ok as I ever am).  

I asked for some images, so they burned me a DVD.  Unfortunately, it was a software DVD
with a _Windows_ application, of all things, to view the images.  That was less than
completely helpful!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-26-headshot-publisher.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Weekend Publisher: Unimpressed" title="Weekend Publisher: Unimpressed" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As you can see, the Weekend Publisher was&hellip; _unimpressed_ with my dilemma.  Though, to
be fair, "unimpressed with your puny human dilemmas" is sort of his normal attitude.  

However, a friend who also happens to be an academic radiologist pointed me at the Horos
Project <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> and their open-source Mac viewer of
[DICOM-format images](https://www.dicomstandard.org/).  I extracted an MP4 from one of
the series (probably neurological nonsense, but it looked sort of like a head, so I went
with it), and then converted that to a 2-second animated GIF for browser
interoperability (and to strip off any inconvenient
[EXIF information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif)).  

The creepiest part for me is the disembodied left ear in the first frame, for some
reason.  

But to be honest, this isn't even the creepiest sequence.  (That one was a slice starting
at the front, in which my teeth and eyes sort of jump out at you suddenly.)  So&hellip;
this isn't the actually _worst_ picture that's ever been taken of me.  

Now you know why you don't want a headshot of your humble Weekend Editor.  

(Hey, US Department of State: Can I get this one on my next passport?)
