Good news on preliminary Phase 3 readout of lenacapavir: 100% efficacy in preventing
infection!  


## HIV Prevention Meds: Why a New One?  

There are already preventive medications for HIV, called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or
PReP medications.  There are 2 problems with the existing PReP meds:  
1. _Human nature:_ They require taking meds _every day._ Most people simply cannot do that
   with perfect regularity, despite encouragement.  
   
   In fact, in some communities there is apparently a social _stigma_ attached to taking
   PReP daily, implying one might have HIV or other sexual partners.  Trust NT social
   games to apply social pressure in _exactly the wrong direction!_  
2. _Not 100% efficacy:_ They're not perfect.  Maybe 99% prevention <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
   but not 100%.  There are fewer bullets in the gun, but it's still Russian roulette.
   Once you know the game is Russian Roulette, the only correct strategy is not to play.  

We can't fix human nature, so the hunt is on for the other one: better meds with 100%
efficacy &amp; fewer chances for people to screw up taking their meds.  


## A Preliminary Readout on the Lenacapavir Trial

From NPR <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> comes a report of good news on that front.  

Gilead is testing lenacapavir (commercial name "Sunlenca") <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>,
the amusingly battleship-sized molecule shown here.  (Med chemists are the _best!_)  

It's a capsid inhibitor that interferes with the HIV viral capsid subunits required to
assemble and release the virus.  It's even already approved as part of some HIV therapies,
so the safety issues have been well studied.  

What's interesting is that it's being studied as an improvement on PReP for _prevention:_
both whether it has better efficacy than PReP, and whether we can get better patient compliance.

The initially counterintuitive aspect here is that lenacapavir is an _injectable,_ whereas PReP
regimens are _oral_ (just pills, basically).  You almost always prefer oral to injectable
to get good patient compliance, because people hate shots but hate pills slightly less.
However, lenacapavir only require injections _twice a year,_ so it can overcome the stupid
social stigma attached to taking PReP pills _daily._  Clever!

Alas, the NPR article is maddeningly short on details, with few if any links to primary
sources.  So we had to dig a bit into the unfortunate world of corporate press releases.
Normally we spit when contemplating these, as they are unreliable.  But&hellip; the trial
hasn't been published (or peer reviewed) yet, so this is all we've got.  Also, there are
severe penalties for misrepresenting results, so we can rely somewhat on fear to push
toward truth.  

Gilead's press release <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> is _slightly_ more informative,
though full of the usual self-serving language.  Their clinical trial
page <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> doesn't appear to tell us much we want to know,
other than this is the trial registered with the US government as
[NCT04994509](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04994509).  It's a Phase 3 trial, i.e.,
where the serious money gets put down before submission to regulatory bodies for
approval.  

This trial is called PURPOSE 1, and is exclusively for women in sub-Saharan Africa.  Yes,
sub-Saharan Africans are only 10% of world population, but they're nearly 2/3 of people
living with HIV, according to NPR.  Also, teen girls and young women get infected at a
rate of about 4000/week!  So it's a _very_ good test population for a trial about
preventing transmission.  There are other "PURPOSE" trials <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>,
still in progress, with similar names:  
- Phase 3 PURPOSE 2, for cisgender men who have sex with men, transgender men, transgender women
  and gender non-binary individuals who have sex with partners assigned male at birth in
  Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, South Africa, Thailand and the United States.  
- Phase 2 PURPOSE 3, for PReP in cisgender adult women in the United States.  
- Phase 3 PURPOSE 4, for injectable drug users in the United States.  

After wading through the word salad so beloved by corporate PR folk and reporters, we can
finally glean some actual relevant evidence about the preliminary data on PURPOSE 1.  It's
described as double-blind, though I have a hard time with that: surely patients and
clinicians can tell if they're taking a pill vs getting an injection, so how can that be
blind?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-11-hiv-prev-news-gilead-3.jpg" width="400" height="96" alt="Gilead: Patient counts and infection counts in the 3 arms of the PURPOSE 1 trial" title="Gilead: Patient counts and infection counts in the 3 arms of the PURPOSE 1 trial" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The approximately 5300 patients were randomized in ratio 2:2:1 to get lenacapavir,
Descovy, or Truvada (the latter 2 being the existing PReP medications used as standard of
care controls).  The exact numbers, taken from the press release, are in the table shown
here.  

Gilead points out the difference in infections per 100 person-years, and asserts
$p \lt 10^{-4}$ without showing their work or even citing the test.  (This is why we
despise corporate press releases, because they make claims without any hope of enabling
peer review!)  

Of course, lacking censorship data about when patients dropped out, we can't say anything
definitive like the trial authors will eventually do.  But we _can_ do a few approximate
things, just with the patient counts above.  So we wrote a little
[R](https://www.r-project.org/) to do exactly that! <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>

### Efficacy Compared to PReP Controls

First, we can treat the trial using the PReP arm(s) as a simple control vs lenacapavir.
That lets us calculate an efficacy by:  

$$
\mbox{Efficacy} = 100\% \times \left(1 - \frac{\Pr(\mbox{infect} | \mbox{lenacapavir})}{\Pr(\mbox{infect} | \mbox{PReP})}\right)
$$

Of course, since the number of infections in the lenacapavir arm was 0, the efficacy will
always be 100%.  However, we can use statistics to get a 95% confidence interval on that.
Here we used the relatively naive binomial confidence intervals calculated by
`ciBinomial()` in R package `gsDesign`.  (A sophisticated method would use
[the Bayesian posterior Beta ratios for which we did the math some years ago]({{ site.baseurl }}/beta-ratios/),
but have not written the R package to implement it.)  

__Conclusion:__ The efficacy of lenacapavir in comparison to PReP was 100%, with 95%
confidence limits of 89.53% &ndash; 100.0%.  

Quite good!  

### Statistical Significance &amp; Strength of Effect  

Another approach, still frequentist, would be to assess whether lenacapavir is
statistically significantly better than PReP ("Is the effect real: likely to reproduce if
we did the experiment again?") and what its strength of effect is ("If it's real, then is
this a big deal or a little deal?").  

For significance, we used a
[test of proportions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval):
are the 2 arms different _enough_ in the proportions infected to be believable?  We applied a
[Yates continuity correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yates%27s_correction_for_continuity)
(mostly because that was the default; we're happy to take advice on this subject).  

__Conclusion:__ The test got $p \sim 2.75 \times 10^{-9}$, i.e., very statistically
significant indeed.  The difference in proportions infected had a 95% confidence interval
of $[-0.022, -0.012]$, nicely bounded away from 0.  The difference in infection rates is
definitely real.  

For strength, we used [Cohen's $h$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_h) as our
measure.  If $p_1$ and $p_2$ are the 2 infection probabilities in the 2 arms, then:  

$$
h = 2 \times \left(\arcsin\left(\sqrt{p_1}\right) - \arcsin\left(\sqrt{p_2}\right)\right)
$$

Since we'll consider it in absolute value, the range of $h$ is $[0, +\pi]$.  By
convention, a value of 0.2 is "small", 0.5 is "medium", and 0.8 is a "large" effect.  

__Conclusion:__ We find $\left|h\right| = 0.263$.  It's not a big effect.  But also keep
in mind that the infection rate under PReP is only 1.7% vs lenacapavir's 0% &ndash;
there's only so much room for improvement, _anyway!_  

So we have a real effect which is as large as possible, given the very good efficacy of
PReP by itself.


### Bayesian Posteriors on the Probability of Infection in Each Arm  

Now let's think a bit like Bayesians:  
- We assume, in each arm, the number of infections $k_i$ is binomially distributed with
  some unknown parameter $p_i$ representing the probability of infection under that arm:  
  
  $$
  \Pr(k_i | N_i, p_i) = {N_i \choose k_i} p_i^k (1 - p_i)^{N - k}
  $$

- Assume our prior beliefs about $p_i$ are uninformative, i.e., $p_i \sim \mbox{Uniform}(0, 1)$.  
- Then a bit of Bayesian algebra tells us that _after_ observing a trial with $N_i$ people
  and $k_i$ infections, our posterior on $p_i$ should be a $\mbox{Beta}(k_i + 1, N_i - k_i + 1)$
  distribution.  
- Armed with that posterior, we can do all sorts of things: 
  - A plot will reveal our posterior beliefs and uncertainties about the $p_i$'s.
  - And of course we can calculate quantiles.  
    - Hardcore Bayesians, when pressed to give a point estimate, will pick the _mode_ of
      this distribution, hence a MAP estimator (Maximum A posteriori Probability).  That
      has a couple nice properties under transformations.  
	- However, your humble Weekend Editor hates modes, and prefers medians.  Especially if
      we're not going to do any further transformations!  So, a _median_ A posteriori
      Probability, or "mAP estimator" might be a silly name for it.  (Nobody uses this
      name!)  
	  
We find the infection mAP estimators to be:  
- __lenacapavir:__ 0.032% (CL: 0.001% &ndash; 0.173%)  
- __PReP:__ 1.74% (CL: 1.32% &ndash; 2.23%)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-07-11-hiv-prev-news.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2024-07-11-hiv-prev-news-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Bayesian posterior Beta distributions for p in each arm" title="Bayesian posterior Beta distributions for p in each arm" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The plot here shows the posterior distributions:  
- The red curve is for PReP, the standard of care.  It has a bump at around 1.7% for
  infection probability, but we could credibly believe from this trial (Bayesian
  "credibility interval") that it's anywhere from 1.3% &ndash; 2.2%.  The vertical red dashed
  line is at the median value of 1.74%.  
- The blue curve is for lenacapavir.  
  - Note that even though 0 infections were observed, we still have a _finite_, but small,
    infection probability.  This is what Bayes methods do: they pull our prior belief of
    uniform probability into piling up all the probability near 0, though with a bit of a
    tail.  
  - Still, it's _really tiny:_ 0.032% is the median, with a credible interval of 0.001%
    &ndash; 0.173%.  
  - The vertical blue dashed line shows the median value of 0.032%.  

__Conclusion:__ The Bayesian posteriors on the infection probability are _quite_ different
in the 2 arms (0.032% vs 1.74%), and very much in favor of lenacapavir.  

Given that PReP was a very good prophylaxis therapy to start, this is as good news as it
is mathematically possible to get.  


## Some Real-World Questions  

But in the real world, nothing is ever allowed to be simple, right?  

### Realism on Cost  

NPR points out a _major_ problem with relative costs of lenacapavir vs PReP:  

> Any eventual approval and widespread use would come with challenges. According to an
> analysis presented at the 24th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2022), PrEP
> medications would __need to cost less than <span>$</span>54 a year per patient__ for
> South Africa, for example, to afford them. Lenacapavir’s cost as HIV treatment in the
> United States in 2023 was __<span>$</span>42,250 per new patient per year.__ Oral PrEP
> options, on the other hand, can > cost __less than <span>$</span>4 a month.__  

So it appears, in order to get effective levels of uptake in Africa (and really, anywhere
else, for that matter) they need to reduce the cost of 2 injections/year by about a factor
of 1,000x.  That's&hellip; more than a little bit daunting.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-11-hiv-prev-news-gilead-4.jpg" width="400"
height="115" alt="Gilead: we promise to do better on price, somehow?" title="Gilead: we promise to do better on price, somehow?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Gilead has apparently responded to these concerns with another press
release. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  Now, big piles of word salad in corporate-speak
are Not My Favorite Thing.  So wading through this for evidence of a plan was tedious.  

It _appears_ that they wish to avoid what is known as "compulsory licensing", in which
countries _force_ them to license to generic makers who will make it cheaply.  They wish
to avoid this by:  

> - Ensuring dedicated Gilead supply in the countries where the need is greatest until
>   voluntary licensing partners are able to supply high-quality, low-cost versions of
>   lenacapavir, and  
> - Developing a robust direct voluntary licensing program to expedite access to those
>   versions of lenacapavir in high-incidence, resource-limited countries. We are moving
>   with urgency to negotiate these contracts.  

Basically: make lots of it available, and seek out voluntary licensing in low-income
countries.  That leads to the question of who's going to block the export from low-income
to medium- and high-income countries, but that's for another day.  

Perhaps there's more in the press release, beyond the point where I could bear to read.  

This is maddeningly vague, but I dunno what exactly a detailed plan for availability at
<span>$</span>54/yr would look like, either.  Maybe we give them the benefit of the doubt for now, and
yell at them a year after approval if the situation is still <span>$</span>42,250 vs <span>$</span>54?  

### 'Efficacy' vs 'Effectiveness'  

Also: it's important to remember that Phase 3 clinical trials are (almost) ideal
conditions.  There's always somebody to supervise, and verify that people take their
meds.  And they usually do their job.  

On the other hand, in actual practice, people forget to take their medications, they're
given stupid amounts of peer pressure to take more or less of it, they maybe can't afford
it, and all kinds of other things.  Stuff works less well under those circumstances.  

Unsurprisingly: medicines work when you take them, and don't when you don't.  

So we have 2 words: 'efficacy' is how well something works under ideal conditions, whereas
'effectiveness' is how well it works under ordinary, real-world, battlefield conditions.  

What we've seen here is that lenacapavir has startlingly good efficacy, under trial
conditions.  It's effectiveness in the hands of patients and their doctor under normal
practice is unknown.  However, the fact that it's just a twice-yearly injection inspires
hope that doctors can remind patients enough to keep them on schedule.  Or so one may
hope.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Keep in mind that everything we've done above is based on just 4 lousy integers: the
patient counts and infection counts in 2 arms.  That's all they've reported, and without
detailed data including censorship we can't proceed further to the more principled Cox
regressions.  So we're somewhat _overstating_ the case for lenacapavir here.  

However, this is unambiguously good news, even with this approximate analysis.  It's so
good, in fact, that according to NPR they stopped the clinical trial and just offered
everybody lenacapavir (__emphasis__ ours):  

> These results were significant enough for the Data Monitoring Committee &mdash; an
> independent group of experts appointed to assess the progress of clinical trials &mdash; to
> recommend that Gilead __halt its blinded trial and offer lenacapavir to all study
> participants.__ On June 20, Gilead announced these results, and now, all participants can
> choose to receive the injection.  

It happens somewhat rarely that a treatment is so unambiguously good that the safety folk
just stop it and say "Game over, just give everybody That New Stuff, right the hell now."
I've seen it happen before, but it's definitely not the rule.  

In a world with so little good news, we should hold onto these moments.
