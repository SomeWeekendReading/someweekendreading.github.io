Problem-solving skills are important.  


## Some days, you just barely get by  

Life seems to be a series of problems to be solved.  
- Some of the time, I can just power through them by thinking hard.  
- Some of the time, the problems are just intractable, and I can't figure out _anything_
  to do.  
- And some of the time, the problems are just _barely_ within intellectual reach so I can
  maybe figure something out if I work outrageously hard.

One example that struck me in childhood is that dogs and cats are intensely interested in
how their cans of food get opened (and more importantly, how and when the food gets out of the can
and into their bowls).  But they are hopelessly intellectually ill-equipped to understand
how the food got _into_ the can.  There's a whole industrial infrastructure around pet
food of which they cannot even conceive.  

Some days I feel like that.  

So does this dog, confronted with a problem _just_ at the edge of his capabilities.  

He's a good dog. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
