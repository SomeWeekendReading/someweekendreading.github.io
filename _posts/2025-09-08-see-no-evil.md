It appears some of our large, powerful institutions are taking a 'See No Evil' approach to
morality: if nobody can see the bad thing, then that's just as good as not doing the bad
thing, right?  


## 3 Monkeys  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-08-see-no-evil-monkeys.jpg" width="400" height="158" alt="3 monkeys with a somewhat inadequate grasp of morality" title="3 monkeys with a somewhat inadequate grasp of morality" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
When I grew up in the US, there was a saying labeled moral instruction but really a joke,
about 3 monkeys.  One covered his eyes ("see no evil"), one covered his ears ("hear no
evil"), and one covered his mouth ("speak no evil").  I was surprised to learn recently
that they are actually of
[17th century Japanese origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_wise_monkeys).  

While I applaud the general theme of "don't get involved with evil", the usual
misinterpretation here is that if you don't see it, then it didn't happen.  So it sort of
encourages a withdrawal from being morally engaged with the world, and simply hiding evil
or hiding from it.  (The origin in Japan is, of course, much more nuanced.  I'm speaking
here of the na&iuml;ve interpretation of my childhood.)  

Alas, this seems to be diagnostic of a moral failure of much of American life: if
something can be concealed, then taking responsibility can be avoided.  

This was brought to mind by an encounter with the following 3 monkeys.  

### Monkey 1: Police Turning Off Supervision on AI  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-08-see-no-evil-mj-1.jpg" width="400" height="189" alt="Parmar @ Mother Jones: Police disabling integrity checks &amp; supervision in AIs" title="Parmar @ Mother Jones: Police disabling integrity checks &amp; supervision in AIs" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
It's no secret that here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), we are
most emphatically _not_ fans of LLM artificial intelligences.  They do _not_ answer
questions; they supply convincing replies structured around "what would a plausible
continuation of this conversation look like, irrespective of truth".  

Nonetheless, people are easily duped into trusting them, since they sound convincing.
Now, it seems, even _police_ are using AI to generate case reports!  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
DraftOne is a report-writing tool that will do things like summarize body-cam videos, with
dubious integrity.  It's _terrifying_ that such reports then go into records and into
court.  

The software initially has a few not-very-effective safeguards:  
- Putting a bit of nonsense characters into the report, forcing the submitting officer to
  edit them out, and in the process read the report.  
- Requiring a certain number of manual edits before the report can be submitted, again to
  encourage _reading and checking_ the output, something which humans deeply resist
  doing.  
- Labeling the parts of the report that were AI-written, so lawyers can see if they need
  challenge later.  

Police departments testing the software have done the most bone-headed thing possible:
_turning off all the safeguards!_  

This is serious.  Not only because of the inevitable hallucinations, but because of the
well-known bias of AI visual processing programs against non-whites and women.  If you're
in court, do you _know_ the report is the officer's memory, or a fable fabricated upon
viewing his body-cam video?  

_Sigh:_ In the 3-monkeys morality, if you don't know then nothing bad happened.  

### Monkey 2: Meta Hides Evidence of Child Sexual Predators  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-08-see-no-evil-wapo-1.jpg" width="400" height="210" alt="Swaine &amp; Nix @ WaPo: Meta covered up child sexual predators" title="Swaine &amp; Nix @ WaPo: Meta covered up child sexual predators" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, sometimes does research on how people react to their
products, in particular the Metaverse.  Then their lawyers got involved, gagging the
researchers. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

It seems that researchers found (a) young children using the Metaverse a lot, and (b) they
were often sexually propositioned.  Meta lawyers immediately (and correctly) recognized
this as a liability exposure for the company.  But instead of telling the company to make
sure not to do bad things, they told the researchers to suppress evidence of bad things.  

_Sigh,_ 3-monkeys morality again: if you forbid finding out what happens to children, then you
have no responsibility for what happens to children.  

### Monkey 3: Donald Trump Lying in Court About Epstein  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-08-see-no-evil-wsj-1.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Safdar &amp; Palazzolo @ WSJ: Epstein birthday letter with Trump's signature" title="Safdar &amp; Palazzolo @ WSJ: Epstein birthday letter with Trump's signature" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As anyone even vaguely alive and paying attention knows, there's a big flare-up of
interest in Trump's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and the sexual
procurement of children for those men.  

For a long time, Trump has been attempting to distract attention and deny the existence of
any such evidence, while refusing to let the Department of Justice release the files.  Now
the _Wall Street Journal_ has a small fraction of the goods, obtained from the Epstein
estate. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

It famously includes a mildly bawdy 'birthday letter', with a silhouette of a woman's body
and Donald Trump's signature placed to resemble pubic hair.  

The really interesting part is that Trump has repeatedly denied the existence of such a
letter, including denials in court by his attorneys.  Even now, he is resorting to his
trademark defense of calling it 'fake news', although handwriting experts say the
signature matches and the chain of custody of evidence from the Epstein estate is solid.  

_Sigh_, poor little 3rd monkey: even if you deny the existence of your evil deeds, you
still performed evil deeds.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

While the 3 monkeys are an instructive fable telling us not to be involved in evil, they
are _not_ telling us that if we don't perceive evil then it's not our problem!  It is not
a moral response to the world if we are destroying evidence and obstructing justice in
preference to _doing good things and not doing bad things_ in the first place!  

A true moral response to the world involves a constant evaluation of whether what we see
is right, and our degree of responsibility in making it that way.  Most of all we need to
look inside ourselves, encouraging the good and discouraging the bad.  All this requires
honest perception of good and evil, within and without, not just being blind and deaf to
responsibility.  

As [Rabbi Heschel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Joshua_Heschel) said,  

> “Above all, the prophets remind us of the moral state of a people: __Few are guilty, but
> all are responsible.__ If we admit that the individual is in some measure conditioned or
> affected by the spirit of society, an individual’s crime discloses society’s
> corruption. In a community not indifferent to suffering, uncompromisingly impatient with
> cruelty and falsehood, continually concerned for God and every [person], crime would be
> infrequent rather than common.”  
>  
> &mdash; Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, __The Prophets__.
