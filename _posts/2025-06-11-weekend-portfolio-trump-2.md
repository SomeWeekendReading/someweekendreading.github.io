As the US government continues to burn under Republican's deranged arson, we've made the Weekend
Retirement Portfolio a tad more defensive.  


## The Sitch  

We've previously discussed our 'neutral' portfolio that we prefer in ordinary
times <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, as well as some more recent defensive changes made
recently in reaction to Trump
[revenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenant) <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>.

Our neutral portfolio, to which we long to return, is an index fund portfolio of:  
- 60/40 stock/bond allocation,  
- 60/40 US/International in stocks and REITs,  
- 60/40 total market stock index funds/small or small-value tilt funds to capture some
  of the Fama-French small and value factors, and  
- 75/25 US Treasuries &amp; TIPS/international bonds (currency hedged).

The particular iteration shown here has a short-term Treasury component (VSBSX), which
was a holdover from the financial crisis (2007-2008) and the COVID-19 decline, defending
against interest rate rises.  (Failing to stick with intermediate Treasuries was a
mistake, but a minor one that helped me sleep well at night.)

The last time we revised this portfolio is shown here; it is more defensive with:
- 50/50 stock/bond allocation,  
- 50/50 US/international in stocks and REITs,  
- 60/40 total market stock index funds/small or small-value tilt funds to capture some
  of the Fama-French small and value factors, and  
- 67/33 US Treasuries &amp; TIPS/international bonds (currency hedged).  

So it's more defensive in allocation across asset classes (basically less stock), and a
bit less US-centric in stock (just a hair less than the global market allocation, which is
about 55/45 US/international.)

However, it still has 67% of the bond sector in US Treasuries.  That's&hellip; getting to
be a sore point.  


## What We Did This Time  

A US Treasury default would be a world-wide economic disaster, from which nothing would be
safe.  _Nothing._  Just an inescapable world depression.  

That's unlikely, but&hellip; Trump _specializes_ in doing the horribly unlikely.  His
economic plan would push the deficit and its time integral, the debt, to heights of
bizarrely self-inflicted financial injury.  While default is unlikely, he might try to:  

- "Reschedule" the debt (forcibly, and illegally, reducing coupon rates and extending terms
  to 50-100 years so bond holders are stuck with very different kinds of bonds than they
  bought).  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-11-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-cnn-1.jpg" width="400" height="302" alt="Wallace @ CNN: DOGE corrupted US government databases" title="Wallace @ CNN: DOGE corrupted US government databases" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- "Monetize" the debt by printing money, with all the inflation that would cause.  It's
  beyond my ken whether this means the inflation protection of TIPS would be honored, or
  whether he would just game the CPI to lie about it.  DOGE has apparently made a lot of
  government databases now wildly inaccurate <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> (and we've
  even documented some of that on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads
  (CLBTNR) <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, so it's not a stretch to think that Trump
  might direct them to lie about inflation.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-11-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-asset-allocation.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-11-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-asset-allocation-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="Asset allocation: a bit more of the bonds are now foreign" title="Asset allocation: a bit more of the bonds are now foreign" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-11-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-pies.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-11-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-pies-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="329" alt="Pie charts: Tax status and asset allocation" title="Pie charts: Tax status and asset allocation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
So we decided to lighten up on Treasuries &amp; TIPS a little bit.  The alternatives are
quite limited:  
- We don't want corporate bonds, since we've previously done regression analyses those look like Treasuries plus a little stock. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  You can't diversify away from stock risk by adding more stock!  
- Junk bonds are even more so, and quite risky even in ordinary recessions, let alone what's about to happen.  
- Dividend stocks?  C'mon, say it with me: _you can't diversify away from stock risk by adding more stock!  
- Alts like commodities, gold, futures, crypto?  Oh, please.  Those are not investments. Those are tools to fleece na&iuml;ve investors.  I'm na&iuml;ve, but not _that_ much.  

So&hellip; more international bonds.  As you can see here, we've gone with 50/50 Treasuries
&amp; TIPS/international bonds.  That makes us 50/50 in stock/bond ratio, 50/50 in
US/international stocks, 50/50 in US/international REITs, and now 50/50 in US/international
bonds.  

There are, I think, 2 possible outcomes here:  
- If I'm regrettably right, I'll probably wish this had been even more conservative, like a
  40/60 stock/bond allocation.  But I'll be glad for this much protection compared to our
  neutral portfolio.  
- If I'm wrong and the world does not melt down, and nobody will be more relieved than me to
  see that, then this will have been a tick more defensive than needed but will not have
  cost too much return.  

I can live with both of those.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

We can only repeat the conclusions from the last time we reallocated the portfolio:  

As always: this is not investment advice; it’s just a summary of what we’re doing here at
Ch&acirc;teau Weekend.  

The world is terrible. But as all the existentialists have said, “Nevertheless, here we are.” We have to cope with what is in front of us.

For investments, that means becoming somewhat more defensive. Politically & practically, it means becoming as difficult as possible, throwing sand in all the gears of Republican fascism.

At my age, I can do the former, but will have to choose carefully about the latter.

As must we all.
