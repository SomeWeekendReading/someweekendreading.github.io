[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about whether the COVID-19 
vaccines _prevented_ Alzheimers.  Wait, what?  


## That's not the way the conspiracy theories usually work?  

Usually, the conspiratorial thinking around vaccines hints darkly, without real evidence,
that some nefarious thing will happen to you if you get vaccinated.  Like, for example,
give you [infertility]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-vaccines-infertility/) or 
give you Alzheimers.  

So it's a bit&hellip; _unusual_ to hear a rumor that a COVID-19 vaccine will _prevent_
Alzheimer's, i.e., do something good for you.  (Beyond, y'know, _not dying of COVID-19_,
which is definitely a good thing but somehow always gets left out.)  

So while I'm very, _very_ tired of knucklehead conspiracy thinking, this looks like
something diffferent.  


## Where do we start?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-18-covid-vaccines-alzheimers-wsj.jpg" width="400" height="153" alt="WSJ: Could COVID-19 vaccines prevent Alzheimers?" title="WSJ: Could COVID-19 vaccines prevent Alzheimers?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So it was with something of a sinking heart I learned from my source that he read it
"somewhere in the _Wall Street Journal_".  Now, I'm a lefty, socialisty, intellectual type
who thinks you should probably _never_ take medical advice from the _WSJ_.  And certainly
not from the OpEd page, which is where our source is.  (Needless to say: don't take _any_
advice from the dreaded Editorial page, in fact don't even read it.  Too many cognitive hazards
from the right-wing propaganda.)  

Still, with a sigh, we found the article in question. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
It's of course paywalled, because _WSJ_.  But the first 5 paragraphs give us a general
idea: 
- First, the author is on board with COVID-19 vaccines being a generally great idea:  
> Covid vaccines enormously reduce the risk of death and hospitalization in those who have
> been infected by the novel coronavirus.  
- But then, they form the relation to COVID-19 always in question form.  This is a bad
  sign, generally indicating a reporter who doesn't want to get caught on the wrong end of
  a fact-check:  
> But could they also help protect seniors against dementia and Alzheimer’s disease?
> There’s reason to hope so.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-18-covid-vaccines-alzheimers-cmaj.jpg" width="400" height="188" alt="CMAJ: DTaP, polio, and flu vaccines associated with lower Alzheimers" title="CMAJ: DTaP, polio, and flu vaccines associated with lower Alzheimers" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- They explore some studies on the incidence of Alzheimers among people who took or
  did not take _other_ vaccines, notably DTaP, polio, and flu. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
  Now, I'm not familiar with that paper from way back in 2001, and nobody's made much
  noise about vaccinations
  as prophylactic against Alzheimers.  Still, it sort of makes sense: people who get
  regularly vaccinated probably watch their health, listen to their doctors, and don't
  come down with horrible diseases that probably have brain effects.  It's easy to believe
  a link to general health behavior, but hard to believe a specific link to vaccines.  
- If you find _one_ study that says something unusual, nobody much cares.  Can you find
  multiple studies that form a pattern?  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-18-covid-vaccines-alzheimers-jnlgeront.jpg" width="400" height="129" alt="Jnl Gerontology: DTAP vaccines and lower Alzheimers" title="Jnl Gerontology: DTAP vaccines and lower Alzheimers" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- Our intrepid _WSJ_ OpEd writer found _one_ other study, from earlier this 
  year. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  This study involved only the TDaP vaccine, but
  found a [hazard ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio) 
  between the vaccinated and unvaccinated of 0.58 (95% CL: 0.54 &ndash; 0.63).  That's
  quite significant!  They go on to assert, but show no data, that other vacccines do
  something similar.  (The _WSJ_ OpEd article misquotes the hazard ratio as though it is a
  percent, which does not really inspire confidence in me.)  
  
Notice something in all that evidence?  There's no relation to COVID-19 or COVID-19
vaccines at all!  It's just making a claim of guilt by association: those other vaccines
help (slightly) to prevent Alzheimers, and COVID-19 vaccines are also vaccines, so maybe they
help too?  

This is skating on ice so thin it might as well be surface tension.  I mean: yeah, maybe.
But this is not evidence.  


## Casting a wider net  

Ok, if we want actual evidence, we'll have to cast a wider net.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-18-covid-vaccines-alzheimers-alz.jpg" width="400" height="191" alt="Alzheimers Association: COVID-19 Advice for Caregivers and Patients" title="Alzheimers Association: COVID-19 Advice for Caregivers and Patients" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The first stop for anyone living with, or caring for someone living with Alzheimers
should be the [Alzheimers Association](https://www.alz.org/).  They're highly reputable,
and full of the latest, best medical advice.  They have, of course, a page about COVID-19
vaccination for caregivers and recipients. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  It's full of
good, compassionate advice, but it mostly comes down to: get vaccinated.  Both caregivers
and patients.  There are, of course, some thorny problems about consent with Alzheimers
patients, so a medical power of attorney is a useful thing.  

But nothing about prevention by the vaccine, just that the vaccine prevents COVID-19.
Which is, after all, _the point of the vaccine!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-18-covid-vaccines-alzheimers-npr.jpg" width="400" height="311" alt="UT Health San Antonio: PET scan & gene evidence of COVID-19 and Alzheimer's similarity" title="UT Health San Antonio: PET scan & gene evidence of COVID-19 and Alzheimer's similarity" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
There is, however, intriguing evidence in the other direction: getting COVID-19 may set
the stage for Alzheimers!  _NPR_ reports on some
(apparently as-yet-unpublished?) evidence from UT Health San
Antonio. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  Their dataset was
PET scans of people before and after COVID-19.  (I wonder how that happened?  How do you
get IRB permission to PET scan people on the chance they might later get COVID-19?)  The
images post-COVID-19 apparently resemble Alzheimers patients (though the _NPR_ report
doesn't say why) and "some of the genes" that predispose sensitivity to COVID-19 are also
sensitivity markers for Alzheimers (though the _NPR_ report doesn't say which genes).  

So&hellip; that's maddeningly vague.  But given the havoc COVID-19 induces, even in the brain,
it's totally believable that some pre-Alzheimers phenotype might happen.  So in that
case, COVID-19 vaccines _would_ prevent Alzheimers&hellip; _by preventing COVID-19 itself!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-18-covid-vaccines-alzheimers-reuters.jpg" width="400" height="205" alt="Reuters Fact Check: no evidence vaccines cause Alzheimers" title="Reuters Fact Check: no evidence vaccines cause Alzheimers" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Finally, why isn't there a conspiracy theory saying the vaccines _cause_ Alzheimers?
That's the way it's usually supposed to go.  Fortunately, _Reuters_ has a "Fact Check"
article ready to go. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> They reassure the timid that: the
Pfizer vaccine does not cause prion diseases like Creutzfeldt Jakob disease, it does not
cause Alzheimers, and it does not cause Lou Gehrig's disease (ALS).  The rumor is traced
to the conservative "news" site Gateway Pundit (to which I refuse to link).  It apparently
got published in a low-quality journal, because accidents like that happen.  The author, J
Bart Classen, has a history of attempting to publish inflammatory articles skeptical of
all vaccines.  Experts consulted by _Reuters_ pronounced his proposed mechanism
nonsensical.  

So&hellip; there _is_ a conspiracy theory that COVID-19 vaccines cause Alzheimers.  Given
its origin in the conservative web, it is predictably nonsensical.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

- There's no particular evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine prevents Alzheimers.  Some
  other vaccines (TDaP, polio, flu) have been shown to do that _somewhat_, but the only link to the
  COVID-19 vaccine is that they're all vaccines.  
- While there is a conspiracy theory by some right-wing anti-vax crank that the COVID-19
  vaccine causes Alzheimer's, it is nonsense and you should ignore it.  
- There is mild evidence that COVID-19 causes some brain changes that superficially
  resemble Alzheimers.  So you can &ndash; somewhat awkwardly &ndash; claim that COVID-19
  vaccines prevent Alzheimers _by preventing COVID-19 itself._  
  
The point seems to be: don't worry about Alzheimers; get vaccinated; if there's a
preventive effect that's fine, but it's more important to prevent getting COVID-19.
