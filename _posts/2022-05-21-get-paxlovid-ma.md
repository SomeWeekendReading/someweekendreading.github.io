## De Re Paxolvidia Bostoniensis

Siderea, the mystery animating _Sibylla Bostoniensis_, has written a very useful
guide to getting paxolovid if you're in Mass and test positive.  <sup
id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

Some of the high points:  
- Stock up in advance on home test kits, the most easily obtainable being rapid antigen
  kits.  
  - They're free, quick, painless, and
  [accurate](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/weekend-editrix-exposed/).  
  - Practice using a test kit if you haven't done so before, and use it when you have any
    symptoms at all.  
- Figure out how to get prescribed paxlovid, and transportation to get it.  
  - Consider the [Test to Treat locator](https://covid-19-test-to-treat-locator-dhhs.hub.arcgis.com/),
    which will find the nearest place for you to go to get tested, evaluated, and
    prescribed if appropriate.  
  - CVS will do something similar with eVisits.  
  - Any Urgent Care facility will handle your situation, too.  
  - Lots of PCPs aren't up to speed on the qualifying conditions for paxlovid, and will
    refuse to prescribe.  However,
    [the conditions are quite broad](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html)
    (e.g., mild overweight).  So print that out, circle the bits that apply to you, and
    hand it to your PCP saying firmly that you qualify by the CDC guidelines for
    paxlovid.  
- Some medical conditions or other prescriptions rule out paxlovid.  
  - For example: a family member had
    to get antibody infusions instead, because of a blood thinner associated with a medical
    implant.  Paxlovid would have made the blood thinner too potent (risk of hemmorrhage)
    and the blood thinner couldn't have been withdrawn for 5 days (risk of throwing a
    clot).  
  - So you may have to insist on an alternative.  Bebtelovimab is one of the few remaining
    infusions that are potent against Omicron.
