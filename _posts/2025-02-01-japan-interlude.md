While the US Republicans were busy excreting a fascist into power, we had a trip to Japan
to visit family.  I took too many pictures, mostly of grocery stores and food.  


## Why?  And What About the Publishers?!  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-assistant-weekend-publisher-in-suitcases.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-assistant-weekend-publisher-in-suitcases-thumb.jpg" width="300" height="424" alt="The Assistant Weekend Publisher wants to come to Japan, too." title="The Assistant Weekend Publisher wants to come to Japan, too." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Well, because the Weekend Editrix is Japanese, of course!  Also, her elderly mother
requires considerable care, and we want to maximize the chances to see her while she's
still here.  So it was mostly a trip to take care of her for a few weeks.  

The Weekend Editrix went first for 2 weeks, and was then joined by your humble Weekend
Editor.  

As you can see here, the Assistant Weekend Publisher was eager to attempt to join
both trips!  (The Weekend Publisher is, of course, himself too dignified for such antics.)
However, both boys were content with the cat-sitter we got to come over and sleep with
them at nights.  

Of course, any such change in the presence of senior members of the tribe will lead to
dominance struggles.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-publishers-wrestling.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-publishers-wrestling-thumb.jpg" width="300" height="454" alt="Senior management of Weekend Publishing Enterprises, wrestling." title="Senior management of Weekend Publishing Enterprises, wrestling." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here we see the Assistant Weekend Publisher about to lie down
peacefully behind his _sempai._  However, his lack of good manners led him to attempt a
play attack&hellip; which, as you can see, led to his being steamrolled by that _sempai,_ who
is twice his size and half his patience.  

The little guy never seems to learn from this, so we think he maybe likes it?  The big guy
is exasperated beyond belief at this.  Exasperation is, of course, the natural state of
older brothers.  He didn't ask for this, but he's coping with the imposition of a younger
'brother' as best he can.  At times, his 'best' involves swatting the little guy across
the room like a hockey puck.  

Of course, no visit this time of year is complete without gifts.  So we got our mother
some nice warm slippers, a Deadpool/Wolverine comic for a nephew, and so on.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-teeth-cup.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="A 3-d printed cup and saucer, edged with human teeth." title="A 3-d printed cup and saucer, edged with human teeth." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
"And so on", as used here, means I had this cup 3d-printed as a joke gift for my
brother-in-law, who is a dentist in Japan.  I happened across the `.stl` files somewhere on
the internet, for no obvious reason.  It turns out there are 3d printing houses which will
do one of these for only a few 10s of dollars, so&hellip; here it is.  

I don't know if it's food-grade or not, but somehow I don't think anyone's in danger of
putting it into regular use.  

I wonder if it will be as funny to him as it is to me?  


## Some Personal Memories Remain the Same  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-conformal-map-window.jpg" width="300" height="273" alt="Decorative window at a shopping center, resembling a conformal map in the complex plane." title="Decorative window at a shopping center, resembling a conformal map in the complex plane." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As [we remarked on a previous excursion to Japan]({{ site.baseurl }}/japan-2022/#:~:text=Look%20at%20the%20glass%20in%20the%20archway%3A%20clearly%20some%20member%20of%20my%20tribe%20was%20involved%2C%20because%20those%20curves%20are%20produced%20by%20conformal%20mapping%20the%20complex%20plane!),
sometimes the smallest little detail can spark a long train of thought.  In this case, a
covered walkway at a train station/shopping plaza near my mother-in-law's house never
fails to make me think of conformal mapping in the complex plane.  This one's a variant
[Schwarz-Christoffel transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarz%E2%80%93Christoffel_mapping),
realized in glass.  Cooler if the arch were wing-shaped and this were a 
[Joukowski transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joukowsky_transform), but still pretty
cool.  

Yes, this is [pareidolia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia).   But it's _my_
pareidolia.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-gaufuru.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="Display of 'gaufuru' wafer cookies, much beloved by my late beloved friend" title="Display of 'gaufuru' wafer cookies, much beloved by my late beloved friend" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
These are some Japanese cookies called _gaufuru_, apparently derived from 'gauffre'
(except those are more like Belgian waffles).  They're extremely thin wafer cookies,
sandwiching a very thin layer of various flavors.  

They always catch my eye, because I used to bring them back as souvenirs for a friend who
loved them.  That friend is now no longer with us, a victim of depression.  But every time
I see _gaufuru_, I think 'Hey, I should get some for&hellip;' and then remember he's
gone.  

It's sad to feel his absence, but it's good to remember people, especially for the good
they did with their lives.  While I hope the best for him in a religious sense, I also
remember the good he did here, with his relentless kindness and good humor.  

And, yeah&hellip; I get momentary tears in my eyes when seeing _gaufuru._  

Miss you, buddy.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-decorative-tile.jpg" width="300" height="303" alt="Ceramic tile with cobalt blue painting, depicting a crowned woman in medieval-ish dress, holding 2 fishes by their tails. The signature says 'Mota'." title="Ceramic tile with cobalt blue painting, depicting a crowned woman in medieval-ish dress, holding 2 fishes by their tails. The signature says 'Mota'." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
This is a decorative tile displayed on a wall of my mother-in-law's house.  My
father-in-law, alas now also departed, collected lots of little bits of art and oddball antiquery
like this.  It depicts a floral background, with a crowned woman in medieval-ish dress in
the foreground, holding 2 fishes by their tails.  

It's always puzzled me: it clearly means _something_, probably related to some myth or
well-known tale.  I know a _lot_ of such tales, but this one evades me.  Initially, I
though it might be the source of the Starbuck's logo, but that turns out to be a crowned
mermaid with 2 tails (holding up a tail in each hand).  I can find some other partial matches
with Google Lens, always in cobalt blue on tile, and always unexplained.  

I'd really appreciate it if anybody could scratch my curiosity bump and tell me what this
thing is!  Probably something obvious that will embarrass me for not knowing, but I really
do want to know or at least be reminded.  


## Some Other Memories Are the Same, But Always Surprising

No matter how often you see some things, they can always surprise you.  

### My Slightly Morbid Fascination with Grocery Stores  

I have a slightly morbid fascination with grocery stores.  I've always been a depressed
&amp; anxious guy, and so I worry about social collapses and sudden shortages of food,
clean water, sewage processing, electricity, and&hellip; civil order.  A professor once
made an impression upon me (many times, actually) in a history of science course: if you
stop the food trucks coming into the city, the warehouses empty out in about 3 days and
food riots begin about 3 days after that.  

So ever since then, I've been fascinated with looking through grocery stores.  Yup, food's
still here.  Anarchy is at least a week away.  (At least, hunger-driven anarchy.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-grocery-store.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="A mid-range Japanese grocery store; note the variety, order, and cleanliness.  No idea why some signs are in English." title="A mid-range Japanese grocery store; note the variety, order, and cleanliness.  No idea why some signs are in English." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Japanese grocery stores are quite reassuring in that regard: large, well-lit, possessing a
wide variety of foods, somewhat reasonable prices (though the yen/dollar exchange rate has
some influence on my thoughts there).  This is a mid-range grocery store, not even one of
the really special ones, and it's beautiful.  

The variety of produce is always pretty good.  Most amazingly, from a foreigner's
perspective, there are a variety of fresh fish&hellip; but the cleanliness is so
scrupulous that it doesn't smell bad.  (In the US, fish specialty shops in particular smell
so awful I just can't go in.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-giant-carrots.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="Giant carrots!" title="Giant carrots!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Also, no particularly obvious reason I'm fascinated by Japanese carrots.  Look at these
thick monsters!  They're not _quite_ as thick as my wrist, but almost.  I daydream about
making a really nice stew with thick chunks of carrot, cooked slowly.  

I wonder if the taste or texture changes when they get that thick?  A lot of Japanese food
plants have been bred extensively to achieve a taste preferred by consumers, so I bet
they're really good, as well as giant.  

Also, given my status as an illiterate and unsophisticated barbarian at the best of times
in Japan, there's probably some tradition or story around thick carrots of which I remain
unaware.  The experience of being a _yabanjin_ is an uncomfortable one, but it makes me go
to great efforts to be polite and respectful.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-special-strawberries.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="Very, very special strawberries!" title="Very, very special strawberries!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Japanese strawberries in particular have been highly bred to have a sweet flavor.
Strawberries in the US are a bit of a roll of the dice: they might be nice, or they might
be almost inedibly sour.  When I was a kid, we always put sugar on them (but then again,
that was the 1950s and 1960s, when _everybody_ did that).  Japanese strawberries, or even
those bought in the US through a Japanese grocer, are always sweet and have a vibrant
fruit taste stronger than the sweetness.  

There's a tradition of making seasonal gifts of fruit, with some kind of complex rules
about going up and down the social status ladder.  These gifts must be absolutely
_perfect_ fruits, so sometimes you'll see a beautiful cantaloupe with artful decorations
for something equivalent to \\$100.  Here we see a presentation box of strawberries, each
carefully cushioned to avoid bruising, that sells for about 4800 yen or about \\$31.  For
just 11 strawberries, that's just under \\$3/strawberry!  

But of course more ordinary strawberries just for eating are priced more ordinarily.  What
you're seeing here is more about social custom than about fruit!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-strawberry-cream-sandwich.jpg" width="300" height="421" alt="A newly popular sandwich: white bread, whipped cream, and strawberries (with English language newsprint?)." title="A newly popular sandwich: white bread, whipped cream, and strawberries (with English language newsprint?)." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Alas, my dark side offers the opinion that sometimes, some people just shouldn't have
strawberries.  Why so grim?  Read on; some foods are temptations to the dark side of
culinary life.  

_Case in point:_ Here's a currently popular 'sandwich' snack: white bread (usually
_shokupan_, a soft white milky bread), whipped cream, and strawberries.  The display,
inscrutably placed atop English-language newsprint, helpfully informs us that this will
only cost us 193kcal, which is less than I thought.  

I don't quite get the target customer population here, unless it's middle school kids
hungry after school to go on a sugar rage.  That doesn't seem quite in line with cultural
expectations, but what does a neurodivergent old nerd like me know?  

And note the display: this was the last one left! It's not like they don't sell.  

<iframe width="300" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xuPdpQP6plI" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
But the pathology runs deeper: this short video tells the tale of a 'snack' at a store in
Tokyo called Age 3 ("ah-geh-san", with a hard g and 3 is pronounced "san"; not "age 3" as
we would say of a toddler in English!).  

They make &ndash; and apparently sell &ndash; a white bread and whipped cream sandwich
that has been, somehow, fried.  Possibly deep-fried.  They also sell a lot of other
'sandwiches' along similar lines, e.g., cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e.  

Now, I almost get this one better than the previous one.  I mean, if you're gonna go for
some insanely indulgent, artery-clogging, type 2 diabetes-inducing dessert, you might as
well do something absurd.  I mean,
[if you're gonna lose your grip on reality, you might as well let go with both hands.](http://localhost:4000/quotes/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20you%E2%80%99re%20gonna%20lose%20your%20grip%20on%20reality%2C%20let%20go%20with%20both%20hands.%20No%20half%20measures!%E2%80%9D)  

The [Scalzi _schadenfreude pie_](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2006/09/26/how-to-make-a-schadenfreude-pie/)
comes to mind as an American example. Though that was irony, not a business model.
This&hellip; seems to be devious temptation and a brilliant loss leader.  

### Pastry!  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-mont-blanc-engineering-sectional-diagram.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-mont-blanc-engineering-sectional-diagram-thumb.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="Mont Blanc pastries, complete with engineering sectional/frontal elevation diagram" title="Mont Blanc pastries, complete with engineering sectional/frontal elevation diagram" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Yes, I have a weakness for pastry.  (Did you notice how gently I treated the fried cream
sandwich above?)  

Japanese pastry comes in several varieties, but mostly they're traditional Japanese (e.g.,
various kinds of _mochi_, a rice paste) or derived from European cultures.  Their flair
for French pastry is as good as, or better, than I've had in Paris.  

Here's a picture of a [_Mont Blanc_ pastry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc_(dessert))
on sale in a _depato_, or department store. It's basically a super-duper cream puff base
with various layers of _cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re_ and topped with a chocolate
and a chestnut pur&eacute;e piped to look like vermicelli.  

But click on the picture to see it full size: there's also what looks like an
_engineering sectional diagram_, or a frontal elevation diagram.  It tells you, very
precisely, what's inside, where it is, and how much of it you're going to encounter.  

Very, very difficult for a nerdy pastry fan to resist!  (Fortunately, the Weekend Editrix
yanked on my arm after I took this photo and prevented me from doing anything _too_
foolish, like buying half a dozen.)  

### The Art of the Bento Box  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-bentos.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-bentos-thumb.jpg" width="300" height="675" alt="Bento boxes (lunch boxes) for sale in 3 stores; admire the food quality and artful arrangement!" title="Bento boxes (lunch boxes) for sale in 3 stores; admire the food quality and artful arrangement!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Usually people translate _bento_ as "box lunch".  That's about as accurate as translating
_kimono_ as "robe": technically correct, but losing all relevant meaning.  Japanese _bento_ lunches
are extraordinarily artfully assembled selections of 5-10 different dishes, sometimes in a
plastic box but sometimes in a beautiful lacquer box.  

This is one of those things that strikes me as extraordinary, but Japanese just shrug and
wonder why I'm so entranced with lunch.  

There are lots of such moments.  For example, once we were looking at a Buddhist temple in
Kyoto.  (I always have awkward feelings about "touring" in other people's sacred space.
Especially so when they're actively using it, and I _really_ don't want to be a
disturbance!)  But in the middle of a beautiful garden was a little orange-roofed thing
the size of a dog-house.  It was, in fact, a Shinto shrine.  In the middle of a Buddhist
temple garden.  This is ecumenism at a _professional_ level!  And every Japanese to whom I
tell this story, just shrugs as if to say "So what?"  (So _this:_ imagine if a Mormon temple
had a Catholic shrine in its gardens.  Wouldn't you want to know the story?)  

Here's a selection of ordinary _bento_ boxes from pretty ordinary grocery stores across a
range of prices.  (Click through to see the full-size triptych.)  They're all pretty
cheap, like you could eat one for lunch every day and never feel an economic loss, or
nutritional deficit, or weight gain.  

They're cheap, tasty, nutritious, and widely available.  My _dream_ is that everybody in
the world should have access to high-quality food like that!  

What exactly is stopping us?  Just a [Gini index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient)
pointing at
[oligarchs who soak up all the wealth to make everything else impossible]({{ site.baseurtl }}/unaffordable-rich/)?
Well, that suggests a strategy, no?  

### The Naming of Stores  

No trip would be complete without an expedition to a Japanese mall.  The Weekend Editrix
sought some clothes that were fitted for Japanese-sized bodies, and a Japanese sense of
style.  And so, a short train trip &ndash; don't get me started on how much I love the
trains in Japan, or we'll be here for years &ndash; to a mall in Nishinomia.  Japanese
shopping malls, unlike those in the US, are not dying relics of a forgotten age.  This is
a nice mall, but not particularly fancy.  

So I did what most husbands did while waiting on spousal clothing selection: I walked
around and looked for something interesting.  What was interesting here was the naming of
stores, many of which inexplicably display their inexplicable names in English.  I
appreciate that marketing people think the choice of names is crucial, but I didn't expect
it to rise to TS Eliot levels (unless every store has a secret name that only the store knows):  

> The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn’t just one of your holiday games;  
> You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter  
> When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES. &hellip;  
>  &mdash; Opening lines of [TS Eliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot)'s,
>          ["The Naming of Cats"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naming_of_Cats),
>          [__Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Possum%27s_Book_of_Practical_Cats), 1939.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-storenames.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-storenames-thumb.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="A variety of interesting English-language store names in a mall." title="A variety of interesting English-language store names in a mall." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here are a selection of stores whose English names are evocative, if puzzling.  (Click
through to see the full-size image.)  
- "UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE MEASURE'S" has a wayward apostrophe, but seems to be about men's
  clothing.  Perhaps "measure" implies custom tailoring?  
- "CIAOPANIC TYPY&trade;" seems eager to overcome the nonsense of the name to remind us that
  it's _trademarked_ nonsense.  I didn't panic.  Nor did a pretend to be Italian and say
  "ciao".  No idea what "typy" means, so not sure if I did that or not.  
- "RAGEBLUE" was neither especially blue nor particularly rage-inducing.  
- "Innocent Individuality" made me ponder whether, in a culture with such strong group
  identity, individuality was by default suspect and not especially innocent?  If so, the
  store seeks to reassure us that their individuality is of the better sort?  
- "mysty woman" is beyond me.  I don't know the word "mysty", since it is somewhat
  existence-impaired.  I do know the word "woman", but know better than to think I
  understand women. So I walked carefully around this one.  
- "w closet" seems like an apt commentary on the George W Bush administration, but that
  could be my desire to spit venom in the general direction of all things Republican.  
- "AMERICAN HOLIC" made me think.  "Holic", of course, from alcoholic, denotes addiction.
  But does this mean a store for Japanese addicted &ndash; for some reason &ndash; to
  American culture?  Or does it mean Americans are generally addicted to a lot of stuff,
  hence our problems with obesity, drugs, guns, and money?  A worthy question!  
- "AS KNOW AS PINKY" is&hellip; well, not especially pink.  No idea if 'Pinky' is a
  person, or somebody's pet fish, or&hellip;  
- "SENSHU TOWEL" is, of course a towel store.  It's not on this list because it has a
  peculiar name, but rather the opposite: it's just a sensible description.  What struck
  me, though, was the subtitle "since 1887".  How many businesses have been in business
  for 138 years with such a narrowly specialized product line?  Are these guys just
  business geniuses, or are the towels extraordinarily good, or am I hallucinating?  All
  viable hypotheses.  


## Food!  

So, we went out to dinner a couple times.  Mostly, we wanted to get Mama-san out and
engaging the world, but also we wanted to enjoy some Japanese restaurants.  

Now, usually people mean something specific by "Japanese restaurants" in terms of the
food and the style of preparation &amp; presentation.  Here, though, we just mean
"restaurant that happens to be in Japan".  Somebody asked the Weekend Editrix what foods
she'd want to try first when she got back to Japan.  Her answer was the French/Italian
place in her neighborhood that was extremely high quality in both French _and_ Italian
styles.  Not&hellip; a typical Japanese answer, eh?  

### _Coquina Quattuor Foliumu_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-cqf-2.jpg" width="300" height="228" alt="Coquina Quattuor Foliumu, a tiny place!" title="Coquina Quattuor Foliumu, a tiny place!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As it turned out, her favorite place had recently closed up business.  However, the chef
opened his own new place nearby, so that's where we went first.  

It's named [Coquina Quattuor Foliumu](https://amagasaki.mypl.net/article/machi-news_amagasaki/95200).  

This is alleged to be "Kitchen Four Leaves" in Latin, as evidenced by the lucky 4-leaved
clovers on their sign.  However, this is a slightly odd word choice according to my inner
Latin hacker: "culina quattuor folia" would have been my first stab at it.  Still, 
[Google Translate seems to agree with the meaning](https://translate.google.com/?sl=la&tl=en&text=coquina%20quattuor%20foliumu&op=translate).
Amusingly, on some of their marketing materials &ndash; like a business card I appear to have
lost &ndash; it says "Quattro" instead of "Quattuor".  Viewed from the starting point of Japanese
language, I guess Latin, Italian, and Spanish are all pretty close.  (They panicked for a
few seconds when I mentioned this to the Weekend Editrix, but I think all is well.  That's
my neurodivergent inner nerd, who sometimes blurts things out when they pop up.  Apologies
if I should have kept my mouth shut.)  

Since they're quite new, they don't seem to have a web site.  The link above goes to a
local news publication, and is the source of the pictures here.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-cqf-1.jpg" width="300" height="225" alt="Coquina Quattuor Foliumu chef/owner and waitstaff" title="Coquina Quattuor Foliumu chef/owner and waitstaff" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
It's also a tiny place, as you an see here &ndash; only 6 seats!  

Also, it's slightly reminiscent of the experience at a sushi bar, where one sits at a
counter and watches the chef.  It's staffed by 2 people: the chef and a waiter, both shown
here.  The chef is quite the showman: he engages his guests in humorous conversation while
preparing all their dishes simultaneously.  Imagine a comedian, an interviewer, and a
juggler all at the same time, and you'll get the flavor.  

The food was excellent, though I forgot to take pictures (alas; you can blame me, but I
blame jet lag).  The price was _amazing:_ we fed 3 people a multi-course French meal
(though without wine) for just around \\$100.  The favorable dollar/yen exchange rate
helped, but restaurants in Japan are not as usuriously expensive as in the US recently.  

Definitely worth the trip.  

### _French Grill Ang&eacute;lique_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-01-japan-interlude-angelique-1.jpg" width="300" height="400" alt="French Grill Ang&eacute;lique: another tiny place, with 3 tables" title="French Grill Ang&eacute;lique: another tiny place, with 3 tables" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Another place the Weekend Editrix and Mama-san wanted to try was a nearby one, called
[Ang&eacute;lique](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=d50a31f2272f5564&q=amagasaki+french+grill+angelique+restaurant&nirf=amagasaki+french+grill+angelic+restaurant&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjd7f_EwqWLAxWU4MkDHSZ-M38Q8BYoAXoECBEQAg&biw=1178&bih=992&dpr=2).
In fact it was _so_ nearby, we could just walk for 10 minutes.  I acted as wheelchair
pilot for Mama-san, which is something I oddly enjoy even with my cane.  

The outside was&hellip; unprepossessing.  It's just a little carve-out below some
apartments, next to a garage and a convenience store.  The inside, as you can see here, is
comfortable though small (only 3 tables).  

The chef is off to the side, instead of on display in front of you, but still observable.
The tiny size of these restaurants means the service is always very personal.  (I'm a
little anxious about personal attention from strangers, again my non-NT side insisting on
squirming a bit.  Most people will love it.)

We had a _prix fixe_ dinner of 10 plates, shown here.  My memory's gotten a bit vague, but
working left-to-right/top-to-bottom: a bit of quiche, some tuna, a mushroom bake of some
sort, a scallop, a soup probably of squash, a shrimp/mussels/risotto, a salad with
brilliantly bright _mikan_ and kiwi, some beef with either a red wine sauce or
_demi-glace_ (the latter is available in, it seems, every Japanese grocery store; in the
US it's a specialty item so [we pull tricks like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4WLUMS7Ung)),
and 2 small desserts: something like a _blanc-mange_ with berries and a tiny apple tart.  

Everything was lovely.  Again, the price was _extremely_ reasonable: 3 people for under
about \\$130 at current exchange rates.  But&hellip; cash only!  (That could have been
embarrassing!)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

This post is titled "interlude" for good reason: Latin _inter_ + _ludos_, between games or
lessons.  (Some wily ancient Roman _magister_/teacher conned students into thinking the
word was the same for "lesson" and "game"!)  

It was a time full of travel stress, jet lag, and seeing family we both love.  But it was
also the very _weird_ feeling of illiteracy for me.  I'm used to being able to read signs
in several languages, knowing the etymology of all the words, the literary and
mythological references, and so on.  To be dumped into another culture, at least as
complicated as all of western Europe taken together was to bathe in a sea of ignorance.
It's quite a lesson in humility when everything is complicated &amp; different.

But&hellip; that's where family live, and there's beauty to be found all around you.
Even if, compared to usual tourist preferences, you think my choices are 'eccentric'.  

That being said, we had to return to the US.  We came back on Jan 20 in the evening, about
8 hours after FFOTUS (First Felon of the United States), as he is now widely called, was installed.  

I was _really_ worried about being hassled at the border.  But we had prepared: I had a
brand-new US passport, the Weekend Editrix had a brand-new Japanese passport and a
brand-new US green card.  Our luggage was squeaky clean for customs, and we had a long
history of being harmless elderly PhD nerds.  (In the case of the Weekend Editrix, her
membership in the Nerd Tribe is largely honorary, as she is possessed of excellent social
skills.)

As it turns out: both entering Japan and re-entering the US, border folks saw my cane and
diverted us to a different line.  In the US, this turned out to be, of all things, the
diplomatic line.  So we got an agent who was reasonably cooperative, if understandably
taciturn.  I could hear, though, other agents somewhat belligerently questioning people in
the other lines about their place of living, jobs, and so on.  

It was quite a shock to have to face the reality of returning to a country rapidly turning
fascist, run by oligarchs for oligarchs.  PoliticsGirl has it summed up accurately in this
video: the norms are gone so don't pretend normality; instead the job of Democrats (and
everyone, really) is to obstruct _everything._  

It literally sickens me &ndash; as in, actual vomiting &ndash; to see Democrats behaving
helplessly and established media like _The New York Times_ uselessly trying to 'find the
center'.  With an opponent who denies your right to exist and opposes democracy at all,
_there is no center;_ there is only a fight.  

Japan was better, at least in that regard.

Nope.
