What ethnic group in the US do you think has the highest vaccination rate?  


## COVID-19 and Native Americans

According to an article from PBS/NOVA <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> had 3.5x the
infection rate and 4x the hospitalization rate of white Americans, they nonetheless
responded heroically with an enormous vaccination effort for their members, and frankly
for anybody who happened to be standing nearby.  This is both responsible to tribal
citizens and generous to those tribal non-citizens who are affiliated with them or work
with them.  

The CDC has begun reporting vaccination rates broken down by ethnic group.  As of July 6,
the breakdown of vaccination rates by ethnic group in the US is, according to the CDC:  

|  __Ethnic Group__ | __% Single Dose__ | __% Fully Vaccinated__ |
|:-----------------:|:------------------|:-----------------------|
|  Native American  |  45.5%            |  39.1%                 |
|  Asians           |  36.6%            |  35.0%                 |
|  Whites           |  33.7%            |  32.2%                 |
|  Hawaiian/Pacific |  35.9%            |  31.3%                 |
|  Hispanic         |  31.8%            |  28.3%                 |
|  Black            |  25.8%            |  23.2%                 |

Note that the Native American vaccination rate is higher than the average rate in 28
states, _including_ the states with high Native American populations.  Basically, they're
just ahead of the pack, and that's a good thing for them.  

There were, of course, problems.  

For example, the CDC guidelines for vaccine distribution went more or less by age or
complicating medical condition.  The Native Americans preferred to prioritize their
culture keepers, i.e., those fluent in their languages, knowledgeable about their
traditions, prominent officiators in their ceremonies, etc.  Those are _predominantly_,
but not exclusively, elders.  So they wanted to distribute vaccines in a slightly
different order according to their cultural needs.  This was entirely sensible.  

Another issue was Native Americans living in cities, away from their home tribes.  They
could go home and get vaccinated early, but run the risk of carrying COVID-19 to their
families.  So that had to be worked out, with careful quarantine.  Again, eminently
sensible.  


## A Sense of Generosity and Plenty   

Most interestingly to me was the near-universal decision across tribes to _share_ vaccine
doses with those who lived with, worked with, or were otherwise affiliated with tribal
citizens.  In the rest of the world, people got pretty nasty about pushing to the front of
the line, while Native Americans _expanded_ the circle of their people to include their
neighbors.  

And _that_, ladies and gentlemen&hellip; is _how it is done._
