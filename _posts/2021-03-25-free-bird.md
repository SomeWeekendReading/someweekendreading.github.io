Let's think about something other than COVID.  Not 
[Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0W1v0kOELA), awesome
as that is, but an actual free bird consorting with flying humans.  

## Paragliding

[Paragliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragliding) is one of the fun things I've
been eyeing for a post-pandemic retirement hobby.  Or, at least, "experience" if not a
hobby.  

A lot of that is due to [Tucker Gott](https://tuckergott.com/), whose
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASjdyu0y8XQ9qJnqxsKHnQ) about
[powered paragliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_paragliding)
caught my imagination a couple years ago.  (Though, to be honest, it's quite annoying
how often people report him to the FAA or call the cops on him.  It must be tedious to
have to carry part of the FAA regulations around with you so you can explain repeatedly
that you're doing everything safely and utterly lawfully.)  


## Flying with birds

But when people take to the sky in something less armored than an airplane, they're bound
to run into the true masters of the sky: birds.  See&hellip; these flying dinosaurs are
more than just a bit territorial.  The _do not like us_ invading their space, and are not
shy about expressing that opinion.  There are a number of amazing videos of birds taking
down drones, one small compilation of which is shown here.

So I was delighted to discover a video of some paragliders (unpowered, just basically
sailing along at high altitude) who had an apparently friendly encounter with a vulture.  

These guys are cruising around over some mountains in Spain, just enjoying the trip.  One
of them holds out a selfie stick for the usual reasons and&hellip; what appears to be a
black vulture decides the selfie stick is an excellent place to perch!  The vulture
apparently thinks these two nimrods are newbies at flight, and shows them just how it's done:
practicing a couple touch-and-go landings, and then gliding gracefully into the wind ahead
of the big, clumsy humans.  

In all, a friendly encounter&hellip; unlike the raptors _vs_ drones videos.  

Apparently, this black vulture is an exotic species: it's native to the Americas, and not
found in Europe.  This particular animal has been apparently hand-raised for hunting, and
decided to pay a visit to the weird humans who look like they have&hellip; no visible
means of support, as the saying goes?  

__Later:__ I discovered this is a bit of a set-up.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
They have actually _trained_ raptors to come meet them in the sky, perch a bit, and then
return to base.  Their 2 trained black vultures are named Edmund and Baldrick (apparently
[_Blackadder_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackadder) fans?).  Ok, not an encounter with
an entirely "free" bird, but still awesome nonetheless.  Maybe even better.

<a id="fn1">1</a>: Apparently the term for flying with a trained raptor is called ["parahawking"](http://www.parahawking.com/).  More traditionally done with falcons instead of vultures, but still.  Today I learned a new word!  [↩](#fn1a)
