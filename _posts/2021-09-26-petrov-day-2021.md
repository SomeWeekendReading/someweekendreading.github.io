Today the world did not end.  That's 38 times in a row, now.  


## Petrov Day: Skepticism of Authority and Doing What's Right, Not What's Asked

Today is the 38th anniversary of Stanislav Petrov's decision on 1983-Sep-26 not to end the
world.  I first learned of this feat from [Ozy Brennan at _Thing of Things_](https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/09/26/stanislav-petrov-day/), 
which pointed me to [a short didactic essay by Eliezer Yudkowsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/QtyKq4BDyuJ3tysoK/9-26-is-petrov-day).

On the day in question, sunlight had reflected off clouds had convinced a Soviet satellite
watching a US missle base that 5 missiles had launched.  Petrov, on his own authority,
defied the launch on warning standing orders and declared it a false alarm.  Probably
Petrov thought something like, "One missile, I can understand &mdash; that's an accident.
One thousand missiles, I can understand &mdash; that's an attack.  But _five_ missiles?
That I cannot understand."  Petrov stepped outside the box of obedience, applied critical
thinking, and decided _not_ to cooperate with the system that would have ended the world.
Or as Eliezer put it:  
> Petrov decided that, all else being equal, he would prefer not to destroy the world.  


## How to Celebrate  

We should all do likewise: do _not_ end the world.  

As I write this in the evening, the world happens to be still in existence as far as I can
tell.  So I conclude that you have all correctly celebrated Petrov Day by not ending the
world, yes?  Just like [last year]({{ site.baseurl }}/petrov-day/).  

If you want to play on the more advanced level, do something that _heals_ the world: [_mip'nei tikkun ha'olam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam). <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
