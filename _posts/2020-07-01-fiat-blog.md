So... yet _another_ blog?  Really?!

"But blogs are passé!"  Everybody says that, so it _must_ be true.  (That sentence is,
of course, an example of 'reasoning' so stupidly toxic that it is an actual cognitive
hazard.  Some of what happens here will be about recognizing and avoiding that sort of
thing.  At least _sometimes_...  Probably the rest will be repenting of some of the times
we've committed similar cognitive sins.)  

Fortunately, I never do _anything_ fashionable, as a matter of principle.  So... passé is
really no problem.  And I retired yesterday, so now I'm passé too.  It... _fits_.  

The [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/) will tell you more or less what's happening.
