In Japan, you can buy almost anything from a vending machine.  Recently, here in the US,
we've made horrible progress on that front.  


## Worst Vending Machine Idea, Ever  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-08-ammo-vending-machine-ar-1.jpg" width="400" height="555" alt="American Rounds, Inc: grocery store vending machines that sell bullets" title="American Rounds, Inc: grocery store vending machines that sell bullets" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Apparently some gun-nut geniuses decided to incorporate a company, American
Rounds <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, to put ammunition vending machines in grocery
stores.  Apparently, it's _really_ inconvenient to run out of ammo on a mass murder
spree while shopping for dinner.  And they think their id-scanning, "360 facial
recognition" system will be secure.  

If you're brave enough to follow the link in the references, there's video.  

Right now, they're in grocery stores in Alabama and Oklahoma, with plans to expand to
Louisiana, Texas, and "all across the South and the Southeast".  Because&hellip; of
_course_ they are, in the deep red states.  

This is, of course, all the more reason _not_ to visit the red states or direct _any_
business their way.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Look, here at Chez Weekend we're a lefty bunch.  Even the cats (though they're not
eligible to vote).  

We think lack of stringent, national gun control is a scandal before earth and heaven:  
- Guns should be (just barely) available for hunting, target shooting and a few sports.  And
  _nothing else_ for civilian use.  
- Even then, those guns should be required to be kept at a shooting club (locked up,
  unloaded, stored separately from ammunition), not in somebody's home.  
- Ballistics identifying each gun (where possible) should be registered with the FBI, so
  that if it's used in any crime the owner can be made legally complicit (unless they
  reported a theft).  
- Ammunition should be, if anything, even _more_ restricted and taxed.  Maybe a high
  deposit on the brass, like soda cans but a couple bucks a shot reimbursed when you turn
  in the empty cartridges?  

_Impulse purchases of bullets?_  This is just insane.  Enough to be a public health hazard.
I'm really surprised the insurance companies of the grocery stores don't shut it down.  

Now, more than ever: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)
