Remember back when I started referring to Trump as a fascist?  (Neither do I.  It's been
way obvious for a way long while.)  Well, now plenty of well-informed others are saying it too.  


## Informed Opinions Piling Up: Trump is a Fascist  

Remember back when we were talking about the ominous impact of authoritarianism in
cops? <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> 

These things start from the top.  Republicans have no problem calling anybody to their
left "socialists" or "communists" or "Marxists", despite those assertions being just
laughably stupid.  (I'm personally something like a democratic socialist of the Western
European mold, but Republicans round that off to "Stalin".)  

So why do they pitch a hissy fit when we call them "fascists", _with ample and convincing evidence?_  

It is, after all, a description of their policies, not really name-calling.  Even a major
scholar of fascism has been agreeing for a couple years now:

Now Prof Robert Reich, former Secretary of Labor, offers a similar opinion as part of a
series of instructional videos he's been making.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  I
particularly like the way he breaks down the technical definitions of political scientists
and those who study both authoritarianism and fascism, into simple practical points:  

1. The rejection of democracy in favor of a strongman.  
2. Stoking rage against cultural elites.  
3. Nationalism based on “superior” race and historic bloodlines.  
4. Extolling brute strength and heroic warriors.  
5. Disdain of women and LGBTQ+ people.  

_All of those_ are prominent features of Trump's rhetoric, and of the Republican party.
It used to be that these were pretty much Republican policies, but _sotto voce_.  Now
they're pretty much screaming it.  (If you listen to Marjorie Taylor Greene, it's not even
"pretty much"; it's _literal_ screaming.)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Trump, and for that matter the entire Republican Cabal, are fascists engaged in an effort
to roll back not just democracy, but the
[Age of Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) itself.  

Do not vote Republican.  Not for any candidate.  Not for any conceivable office.  Not
under any circumstance.  

Also, don't vote 3rd party: that's how Republicans get elected, by splitting the
non-right-wing vote.  Vote Democratic, or resign yourself to American dictatorship.
