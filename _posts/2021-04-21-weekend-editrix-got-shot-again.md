Today the Weekend Editrix got shot.  Again.  (The good way.)  


## Getting the second dose  

Mostly, it was pretty easy.  They sent her a couple email reminders, and it took all of
10min to get to the pharmacy at the appointed time.  

Of _course_, something had to go wrong.  Just like last time, they insisted they'd sent
her a text with a link to a health quiz.  Of course, no such text arrived.  So they sent
us to the pharmacy desk for "manual check-in", which consisted of another person
_insisting_ that a text was sent, and we just needed to look for it.  Again, simple
stubborn persistence paid off: within about 10min a 3rd person, possessed with a modicum
of reason, checked the list and let us in.  

Why do people insist their sytems work when _clearly_ the do not?  And why are the
reasonable people the third layer of backup?

Herein illustrated is the Weekend Editrix, now in receipt of her second dose of
BNT162b2/PF-07302048, a.k.a. tozinameran/Comirnaty.  I note with some approval that the
nurse was appropriately gloved and sanitized the gloves beforehand with alcohol, unlike my
experience.  

Afterwards, she pronounced herself "satisfied", and "glad the wait is over".  Though,
really, there's nothing _but_ waiting for her immune system to build up over the next 2
weeks: her Immunity Freedom Day will be May 5.  

Tune in tomorrow to see what side effects may follow.  


## Addendum 2021-Apr-22: the Weekend Edtrix's sequelae  

It's worse than last time, but still not too bad.  

Her arm is a bit sore, but easily endured.  She had a fever that peaked last night (actual
temp: normal + 2.0&deg;C).  Some 8hr long-lasting acetaminophen got that down to a more
reasonable place.  Tired, but ensconced on the couch busy building antibodies &amp;
training memory B cells.  We were a bit worried about fast heartbeat, but a quick call to
our PCP's office reassured us that this was to be expected.  

So far, so good.
