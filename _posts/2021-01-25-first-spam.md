Honestly, what sort of idiot tries to sell fake Viagra on an obscure, crummy little blog
like this?  And on an old post at that?!  (Please don't answer those rhetorical questions,
_especially_ if you actually know the answers.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-01-25-spam-weekend-publisher-uninterested.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Weekend Publisher: declining to be excited" title="Weekend Publisher: declining to be excited" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Today this blog received its very first spam comment: a link to someplace alleged to
sell "non-prescription Viagra".  I.e., with "illegal" in big flashing red neon
letters.  On a blog run by a former drug research nerd.  I declined to explore the link
and deleted it in moderation, thereby employing for my first time what 
[Scalzi](https://whatever.scalzi.com) terms 
["the mallet of loving correction"](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22the+mallet+of+loving+correction%22&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS504US504&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiDxeuU07ruAhVxFVkFHcClDK4Q_AUoA3oECAkQBQ&biw=1114&bih=948).  

I mean, it wasn't even _interesting_ spam, just ordinary internet dust.  

I tried to alert the Weekend Publisher, but &ndash; as you can see &ndash; he was
unimpressed.  Busy nap schedule, you know.  "Management science" is a heavy bear to burden.  

I was, however, slightly touched on two accounts:  
- The perpetrator(s) had managed to get past _both_ a 
  [RECAPTCHA filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReCAPTCHA) _and_ a bot trap (most bots
  will fill out all fields in a form, so there's one field that says up front that it
  requires you to leave it blank).  So it was either a bot of mildly disturbing
  intelligence, or possibly a low-paid human slave of capitalism, working through the
  tedious chores of a day's work.  Neither is particularly appetizing, but it means
  somebody made some effort to get in.  The humdrum message they left was more than a bit
  anti-climactic, though.  
- Somehow I felt the blog had _arrived_, in that it was being noticed.  I'll grant you,
  it's being noticed by unsavory persons whom I have firmly ejected overboard&hellip; but
  at least it's being noticed.  

So now we've probably got about 6 readers (only 3 of whom are me, my spouse, and my cat).
