Remember how much US Republicans during the pandemic thought wearing masks was a horror
beyond imagination?  They've gone beyond that, now.  


## OK, Where Can They Actually Go, Though?

Perhaps a few loyal, persistent, and deeply disturbed readers of this Crummy Little Blog
That Nobody Reads will remember back in the early days of the pandemic when we ranted
about vaccine resistance and mask defiance in the red states of the
US.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> There was quite a bit of data analysis in that post, relating
vaccine resistance to Trump voting, and so on.  I was particularly struck by the gentleman
shown here, wearing a fishnet mask at CPAC as the very embodiment of the term for the
particular stupidity of "malicious compliance".  

Never mind that the data of the time showed _mask requirements worked_ at reducing
COVID-19; the conservative mind is apparently unburdened by reason.

Did you think things had gotten better?  

Me neither.  

Several North Carolina news outlets are reporting today on this subject, and I had the
misfortune to learn about it. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  (No offense intended to
Mr. Doran or his employers; it's the news that's problematic, not the reporting.)  

Apparently their Senate voted along party lines to ban the wearing of masks in public,
_even for health reasons,_ e.g., during the pandemic!  The excuse proffered is that they
think protesters are wearing masks to prevent facial recognition from police surveillance
cameras.  To that, I say more power to the masked protesters!  We abuse facial recognition
to abominable levels now, and protesting that along with whatever else is perfectly
reasonable.  However, their proposed law bans _everyone_ from masking, not just
protesters.  Immunocompromised cancer survivors, anybody at all conscious about COVID-19
or H5N1&hellip; _everyone._

There's some tense history here, about mask laws and the Ku Klux Klan (who were
traditionally masked).  There was a Democratic attempt to amend the bill so it
specifically applied to hate groups like the KKK and Proud Boys.  However, it failed; the
KKK apparently have _specific_ permission to apply for the right to wear
masks in public!  The Republican response was more or less, "Just trust the police."  

So&hellip; stupid about public health, contemptuous of public protest, and now
specifically racist.  

It's a trifecta.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Just to sweeten the pot, they also wanted to increase toll road late fees by 50%, allow
billboard companies to cut down more roadside trees, and automatically charge 16 & 17 year
old kids as adults in criminal cases (but not to lower the age of majority).  

It appears that the modern Republican party is not satisfied with a kowtow to big
corporations and the economic aristocrats who own them.  Now they must go further with
overt _hostility_ to the rest of us, whom they ostensibly represent.  

Never vote Republican.  Not ever.  Not for any conceivable office.  Not under any circumstance.
