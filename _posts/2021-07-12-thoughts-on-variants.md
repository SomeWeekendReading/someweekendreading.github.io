The variants are starting to pile up.  Unless we vaccinate everybody faster, there are
going to be variants which evade vaccines and then _we start all over_.  How close are we
to that?  


## Who's dying in the current COVID-19 wave(s)?  

Things are getting worse: cracks in the dam are appearing, but the dam has not yet burst.

For example, a summary report from _Forbes_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> (and yes,
this is not exactly a qualified medical new source, but we have what we have) quotes
[Rochelle Walensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochelle_Walensky) of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention as saying in a White House briefing that:
- 99.5% of COVID-19 deaths over the last 6 months have been unvaccinated people.  To be
  fair, 6 months ago vaccinated people were thin on the ground.  But a lot of deaths have
  happened since then, and the vaccines have stopped nearly all of them.  _Nearly all
  COVID-19 deaths from now on are preventable._  
- A previous AP analysis <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> got 99.2%, so this is quite
  consistent from 2 different analyses.  
- But&hellip; about 1,000 counties mostly in the US South and Midwest have vaccination
  rates below 30%.  _These people are at risk of preventable death._  


## 2 paths that both lead to herd immunity&hellip; but are _very_ different  

Just so you can see how unequal it all is, look at the map.  Ashish Jha is the head of the
Brown University School of Public Health.  Note well his comparison of the different paths
to "success" taken by the very few states that are in good shape:

Now here at Chez Weekend, we're safely ensconced in highly vaccinated New England.  But
what about South Dakota?  What did they do?  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Vermont and South Dakota are actually very similar<br><br>
    Both have slightly older, white, rural populations<br><br>
    Have comparable median incomes<br><br>
    Both have Republican governors<br><br>
    And these days, they look super similar on infections<br><br>

Ok, so South Dakota looks pretty similar to Vermont and Massachusetts.  What's different?
How they _got_ there:

    But here&#39;s where they diverge<br><br>
    Vermont has vaccinated (1+ shot) nearly 75% of its population <br><br>
    SD? 50%<br><br>
    Vermont has a high degree of immunity through vaccinations<br><br>
    So how does SD have high population immunity?<br><br>

South Dakota just gave up, and let people get sick and die.  The survivors are more
immune.  And you can see it in the death rates of South Dakota vs Vermont, showing the
essential cruelty of conservative policies.  New England did it better.  

Immunity is not _just_ a science problem; it's a social and political problem.  So long as
we have political parasites preying on the ill-informed to persuade them to avoid
vaccines, people will die.  It's almost difficult to understand why that's not a crime.  


## Current vaccines work against current variants&hellip; so far  

So far, the 5 major vaccines that are widely available work pretty well against the known
variants, including the scary Delta variant (B.1.617.2).  [Eric Topol, the head of Scripps
Research Translational Institute](https://drerictopol.com/meet-eric-topol/), summarized it
for us in a nice little table:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VaccinesWork?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VaccinesWork</a> vs Delta<br>
    A summary table I put together for vaccine protection from the Delta variant from publications and preprints.<br>
    5 vaccines—neutralizing antibodies well above threshold (lab studies) <br>
    3 vaccines—clinical effectiveness<br>
    will update as more data becomes available <a href="https://t.co/A56ekP1Rsi">pic.twitter.com/A56ekP1Rsi</a>

Basically all of them seem to work using _in vitro_ studies in the lab.  For the J&amp;J and
Indian vaccines we don't yet have clinical data on Delta.  But for Pfizer/BioNTech,
Moderna, and AstraZeneca we do have data: &gt; 90% efficacy against hospitalization &amp;
death, and still quite decent efficacy against symptomatic (but not hospitalizable)
infection.  Recall that last spring we were _hoping_ for a vaccine with &gt; 50% efficacy,
so these results look really good.  In _spite_ of our stupidity that makes us vaccinate so
painfully slowly, arguing bitterly at every life-saving step.

That's good, but&hellip; the virus isn't sitting still.  It's still being evolved by the
environment of willing victims to become more infective, and to worm its way around
vaccines.  The scariest version of that has been the emergence of the Epsilon variant
(B.1.427 and B.1.429; no idea why they collapsed 2 arms of the phylogenetic tree into a
single variant).  Coming out of California this time, is evidence that it has some ability
to escape vaccines <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>.  

Figure 2 in that paper does indeed show lower neutralization of the Epsilon variant by
antibodies from Pfizer or Moderna vaccines as well as from blood serum from convalescent
patients.  It doesn't look super-dramatic to me, and there's no clinical evidence _yet_
that this is enough to be a problem.  But clearly the virus is rattling the doorknobs,
looking for a way in.  

Maybe we should consider ourselves fortunate that maybe the Delta variant might be more
virulent and outcompete the Epsilon variant, suppressing the vaccine evasion mutations?
There's some very early evidence of that (too early to cite, really); but that's awfully
thin "luck"!  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Look, you know what's right: just get vaccinated.  Every person who delays vaccination
puts not only themselves and their loved ones at risk, but also becomes an incubator for
deadlier and deadlier varints.  Get vaccinated and be on the side of humanity; don't be a
collaborator with the virus!  

The slower we go, the more chance of a vaccine escape mutation.  And then we start 
_all over again_, with deaths and misery and lockdowns and re-vaccinations.  

Please don't make us all go there, ok?
