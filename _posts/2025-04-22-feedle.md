So there's this "Feedle" thing: a search engine of RSS feeds.  


## Feedle  

People are &ndash; finally! &ndash; growing sick of social media as a
billionaire-controlled platform.  Some have actually gone back to blogging &ndash; welcome
back! &ndash; as a way to have their own platforms.  

With blogs, and for that matter with any site, there's a thing you can make called an RSS
feed.  RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication".  It's basically an XML file full of
entries for the last $N$ entries made on the site.  On this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody
Reads (CLBTNR), $N = 10,000$.  You get to the feed by the next-to-rightmost icon at the
top of every page, the one with mouseover text that says "RSS Feed (XML)".  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-04-22-feedle-feedle-1.jpg" width="400" height="160" alt="Feedle: a search engine for feeds, from blogs or podcasts" title="Feedle: a search engine for feeds, from blogs or podcasts" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
[Feedle](https://feedle.world/) is an attempt at a search engine where every result is
from somebody's RSS feed.  You can now very directly get at blog feeds and podcast feeds,
without any AI sewage, parasitic advertisement, SEO 'optimized' nonsense, or other
[Doctorow-style en- _mumble_ -ification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification).  

Seems like a nice idea, billionaire-proofing the aspects of our lives where we can!  

So your humble Weekend Editor submitted this CLBTNR, together with links back to the
Mastodon account (see that 3rd from the right icon up top, looks like an elephant head
with a capital "M" in it?), a couple days ago.  So far, nothing seems to have happened.
But&hellip; they've probably got like a million bloggers all wanting their feeds to be
searchable.

Nope.
