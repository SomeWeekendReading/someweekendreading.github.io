A couple days ago, I saw something weird in Harvard Square.  Nothing weird about that, right?  


## A Most Peculiar Sign!  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-05-ogham-harvard-square.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-05-ogham-harvard-square-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Harvard Square: a very peculiar sign!" title="Harvard Square: a very peculiar sign!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
I was walking through Harvard Square in the general vicinity of
[Car Talk Plaza, near the former site of the venerable offices of Dewey, Cheatham, and Howe](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/thomas-magliozzi-plaque).
I was just minding my own business when one of my background processes reached out the
back of my head, grabbed my ponytail, yanked me around and said, "Lookithat!"  

At first, I could tell something was off, but couldn't quite tell what it was.  Look at
the signage in this photo (click to embiggen).  More or less ordinary signs, until you get
to the yoga studio at the top.  See that mass of vertical lines, stricken through by a
horizontal line?  _That_ is what triggered my background process.  

I stared at it for a bit, puzzled.  (This is perfectly normal behavior in Harvard Square.)
Then _another_ background process slapped me around and said "Oh!  Oh!  I know this one!"  

Beginning around 300 - 400 CE in Ireland, there was a style of writing used for Old Irish
and Pictish, called ["Ogham"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogham).  The modern
pronunciation would have the "gh" sound sort of like a "w", though older dialects would
have it be a hard "g".  There's a reasonable tutorial on
[Ogham.co](https://ogham.co/ogham-alphabet/), if you want to see the various letters.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-05-ogham-harvard-square-Ogham_Stone_Rathass_Church_Tralee_Kerry.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-05-ogham-harvard-square-Ogham_Stone_Rathass_Church_Tralee_Kerry-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="657" alt="Wikipedia: a stone with an Ogham inscription, from a church in Co. Kerry." title="Wikipedia: a stone with an Ogham inscription, from a church in Co. Kerry." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Normally it's written vertically, read from bottom to top.  

Unusually among all languages, it's made to be written right on and around the corner of a
rectangular stone pillar: half the letters go around to the face on the right, half around
to the face on the left, and the edge bisects the whole inscription.  It looks, honestly,
like some stone-eating creature chewed on the pillar and left teeth marks.  

Wikipedia offers us this picture, of an Ogham-inscribed stone in a church in County Kerry,
Ireland.  The scratch marks that wrap around the corner are Ogham writing.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-05-ogham-harvard-square-begin-end.jpg" width="400" height="148" alt="Ogham begin/end marks" title="Ogham begin/end marks" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
There are usually some special arrow-like marks at the bottom and top of the inscription, as shown
here, which basically mean "beginning of text" and "end of text". When written
horizontally for modern convenience, it is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and a horizontal
bar is used to represent the corner edge of the stone.  

It appears that so far, whoever's doing this has got it mostly right, with only a couple
minor errors:  
1. The begin/end markers are missing.  
2. Instead of writing horizontally, it should either be written vertically, or, best of all,
   wrapped around the vertical edge of the sign.  

Still, not bad.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-05-ogham-harvard-square-analaigh.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="Verifying the Ogham spells out 'anal&aacute;igh'." title="Verifying the Ogham spells out 'anal&aacute;igh'." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Now let's work out what it _says_, if anything.  According to the tables of letters, it
spells out "anal&aacute;igh".  We can check that with the
[Ogham transliterator at Ogham.co](https://ogham.co/?q=analaigh), and it agrees with my
reading, as shown here.  

Ok, fine&hellip; but what's that?  Wiktionary reliably informs us that
["anal&aacute;igh" is a word in (modern) Irish/Gaelige for the verb "breathe"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/an%C3%A1laigh).
(Though usually the second a has an acute accent, as in &aacute;.)  

That _almost_ makes sense, since the yoga studio is named "BR&Emacr;ATHE", albeit with
the incomprehensible macron over the E.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

At that point, I thought this was the Most Harvard Square Thing Ever: a studio teaching
yoga, a discipline imported from the Indian subcontinent, labeled in Modern Irish but
spelled using a 1500 year old writing system, to advertise to largely English
speakers!  I thought this must have been some jape by a bored denizen of the
[Harvard Department of Celtic Languages &amp; Literature](https://celtic.fas.harvard.edu/).  

But then I [just Googled "analaigh"](https://www.google.com/search?q=analaigh) and found
thousands of yoga studios, hair salons, and alternative "medical" services.  A lot of
them use this Ogham inscription (click over to the associated image search), probably
copied from each other.  

So&hellip; our conclusion is correct, but we _definitely_ got there the hard way.
_Comme d'habitude!_

Nope.
