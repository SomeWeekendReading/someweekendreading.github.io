It seems Twitter is dying.  Time to armor plate this blog so quote tweets survive.  


## RIP Twitter?  

So, yeah: Twitter seems to be dying.  Musk has fired all the site reliability engineers,
made demands senior engineers deemed unacceptable enough to quit, and generally destroyed
internal knowledge of bespoke systems.  Years of building have created undocumented (and
unknown) circular dependencies, so when it next crashes&hellip; it may never come back.  

It would be ironic but useless to refer to Twitter threads about this, so here's a _Vanity Fair_
article that covers the nontechnical ground. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

in the roughly 2.5 years of this blog's existence, it has embedded tweets many times,
using Twitter's own code.  When that disappears, so do those references!  

So I've spent the last 2-3 days screenshotting those tweets, and hyperlinking the image to
the tweet.  Crude, but effective:  
- Page loads are way faster  
- If Twitter goes, the screen shots stay here  
- But&hellip; I have to use some storage for screenshots.  

It's a fair trade.
