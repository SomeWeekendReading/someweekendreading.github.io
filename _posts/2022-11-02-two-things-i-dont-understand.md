Sometimes there's nothing to do but confess one's own ignorance.  


## 2 Cases in Point  

In the last couple days, while hiding in bed avoiding my fear of a fascist turn in the
upcoming mid-terms, a couple things have _really_ confused me:  


1. Have you ever noticed that when you look up
   ["ineffable"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineffability) in the dictionary, they
   explain it by just _using more words?_  That seems wrong, somehow.  Wittgenstein had right:
   [_Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen,_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractatus_Logico-Philosophicus#Proposition_7)
   indeed!  
2. Indeed, I will never understand economics:

Looks like some Australian mogul got mad about being made to look like a fool?)

And you can't make me.
