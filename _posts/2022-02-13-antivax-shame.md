The shameful behavior of the anti-vaxxers has reached intolerable levels.  It's been
extremely bad for a while, but now they're picking off prominent scientists and public
intellectuals with death threats.  


## Thugs using threats

We all know by now that the anti-vaxxers are knuckleheads.  They also, like most right-wing manias,
have a streak of barely suppressed violence.  This week came 2 examples where they have
been _threatening physical violence upon the families of scientists_, in this case Katelyn Jetelina of
_Your Local Epidemiologist_, the University of Texas Health Science Center at
Houston, and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical 
Center <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> (and of whom we are
fans on this blog).  

The _Medpage Today_ article chronicles just how many _millions of dollars_ are being
directed into the coffers of purveyors of anti-vax disinformation, and the extreme
lawlessness to which they are willing to resort to defend that money.  Jetelina said of this
state of affairs where we funnel money at people who lie and disrupt:  

> &hellip; is risky and I hope there's recognition in that. Not only risky for the health
> of our population but risky for the personal safety of me and fellow scientists fighting
> disinformation every day.  
> &hellip;  
> My life and the lives of my family have been directly threatened throughout this
> pandemic from followers of this disinformation &hellip; And we've
> had to take certain steps to ensure the security of my family. The threat is real and it
> is scary. It is also incredibly exhausting and I'm tired.  

So on  her blog she says the combination of deep funding of destructive anti-vax sources
combined with actual _death threats_ for her and her family has led her to take a break
from blogging:  

> Taken together, the death threats are more serious. The microaggression is deeper. And
> the punches are coming from every angle.  
>  
> And I’m tired.  
>  
> So, I’m taking a break for a week or two.  

So she's "taking a break" from the [thuggery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuggee).
I hope it's in a location that's a well-kept secret with good police protection.  She
deserves some safety at the _very_ least.  

The anti-vaxxers, on the other hand, deserve shame. And criminal prosecution for some of them.  

Part of me wants the anti-vaxxers to be taken out and shot.  "Shot" with a vaccine,
of course, because that's just poetic justice.
