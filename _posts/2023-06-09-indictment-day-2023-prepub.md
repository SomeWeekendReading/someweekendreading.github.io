Yesterday in the US, we experimented with a possible new national commemorative holiday:
Indictment Day for Donald Trump.  


## Indictment Day  

Today the [@IndictmentsOnly account at Twitter](https://twitter.com/indictmentsonly)
proved its usefulness:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/indictmentsonly/status/1666954703752556544"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-indictmentsonly-1.jpg" width="550" height="692" alt="IndictmentsOnly @ Twitter: Trump indicted for federal crimes on classified documents" title="IndictmentsOnly @ Twitter: Trump indicted for federal crimes on classified documents" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Yes, others related to Trump have been indicted (George Santos &ndash; who is sort of a
House avatar of Trump's constant lying &ndash;, Trump aide Walt Nauta, former Trump lawyer
Michael Cohen, etc.).  And it's even true that Trump has been himself indicted (NY sexual
assault case, but it's a civil case since the statute of limitations has expired) _and convicted._  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-bi-1.jpg" width="400" height="263" alt="Italiano, et al. @ Business Insider: Trump's docket and pending cases" title="Italiano, et al. @ Business Insider: Trump's docket and pending cases" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
But there are several other criminal and civil cases pending!  

But this is the first one that's a _criminal_ case, and a federal one at that: apparently
(the indictment is still sealed) 7 charges including illegal handling of classified
documents, obstruction of justice, lying to the FBI, and possibly the espionage act if he
showed them to others.  (Given the huge Saudi payment to Jared soon after, this seems
likely.)  

The others pending, as of today, seem to be, according to a nice summary yesterday at
_Business Insider_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

- 34 felony counts of falsifying business records, in NY state court  
- Attempted overthrow of an election and intimidation of an elections official, in GA
  state court.  (The Federal Department of Justice is also investigating this.)  
- A second defamation accusation by E Jean Carroll, given he defamed her immediately after
  being found liable for defaming her in NY court.  
- A charge of campaign finance fraud, based on the hush money payments to Stormy Daniels.  
- &hellip; and _quite_ the collection of other cases.  

It's taken a long, long time to get here, at sometimes-glacial speed.  We may all have our
discontents with our institutions, of course.  But sometimes their slowness is due to
deliberation and the need to get the facts _exactly_ right, not just _sorta_ right.  And
now we're here.  Finally.  

The actor George Takei, who played Sulu on StarTrek:TOS, seems to have quite a head on his
shoulders for coming up with incisive summaries.  Here on this Crummy Little Blog That
Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), we have
[previously quoted him favorably]({{ site.baseurl }}/pessimism-and-optimism/#:~:text=The%20Good%20News%3A%206%20Reasons%20to%20Hope)
on the duty to find hope in difficult circumstances, the case in point for him being the
shameful Japanese detention camps in the US during WWII.  

Today on Mastodon, he "explained" the interaction between Trump indictments, climate
change, why Canada is currently on fire, and the execrable air quality in New York.  I
mean, it's not _factually_ true, but it makes perfect sense in _mythic_ terms, no? 
<a href="https://universeodon.com/@georgetakei/110515201315044445"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-takei-1.jpg" width="550" height="246" alt="Takei @ Mastodon: Why orange smoke is related to Trump indictments" title="Takei @ Mastodon: Why orange smoke is related to Trump indictments" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

"That pretty much sums it up." -- Oz, played by Seth Green, in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_,
season 2, episode 13, "Surprise".  The character Oz rarely shows much emotion outside his
love for Willow, and is never surprised.  But when the situation calls for surprise, he's there
for you.  Here he was told he was attending a surprise birthday party for Buffy, but got a
surprise of a different sort for himself, upon seeing Buffy stake a vampire in front of
him.  "Surprise!", indeed. (Sorry the video loops.  Feel free to help me out and show me
how to squelch that particular misbehavior.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-nyt-1.jpg" width="400" height="184" alt="Various authors @ NYT: Trump federally indicted, with live updates" title="Various authors @ NYT: Trump federally indicted, with live updates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I first got the news last night (while sitting in Boston Symphony Hall, pondering some
weirdness around Rimsky-Korsakov, but that's a story for tomorrow's post).  The _NYT_ had
immediate coverage <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, and as is always the case with
rapidly developing stories, live updates that continue even to the present moment a day
later.  Read through it for yourself to catch up on the updates, or look at whatever the
_NYT_ folk come up with after a day or two to put it all in context.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-npr-0.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Various Authors @ NPR: Trump Federally indicted, faces 37 counts, with live updates" title="Various Authors @ NPR: Trump Federally indicted, faces 37 counts, with live updates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
There's also a similar series of live updates from _NPR_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, 
just in case you want a different set of reporters making their case to you.  

Interestingly, they chose to bring the indictment in Florida instead of DC.  It's much
more likely that there will be a Trump-favorable judge in whackaloon conservative Florida
than in largely Democratic DC.  It could be an effort to bend over backward and give Trump
every chance, or it could be that there are other indictments for crimes that occurred
only in Florida (say, hiding documents at Mar a Lago, or the pool draining that flooded
the server room and destroyed surveillance footage prosecutors wanted).  We'll see.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-npr-1.jpg" width="400" height="156" alt="Washington Desk @ NPR: Trump-appointed judge overseeing Trump's criminal case" title="Washington Desk @ NPR: Trump-appointed judge overseeing Trump's criminal case" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
__Hoo, boy:__ as I'm writing this on 2023-Jun-09, news come out that the federal judge in
Florida who will oversee this case against Trump was US District Judge
[Aileen Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aileen_Cannon),
appointed by Trump himself. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  
- I wonder if she will recuse herself, because of the very strong stink of conflict of
  interest and inability to be unbiased?  
- Or will she stick with the case:  
  - If so, a conviction will stick all the harder, given that Trump already had a hand in
    choosing his own judge, against all precedent.  
  - Alternatively, Cannon now has the power to prevent the case from ever going to a jury to
    protect Trump.  Or she could reduce the sentence to a hand-slap, instead of serious
    prison time.

Bringing this case in Florida was a risky move; risk, thy name be Aileen Cannon!  Everything
depends on what kind of person she turns out to be.  The augurs do not look good: she's
the whackaloon who ruled in favor of Trump's request to appoint a special master last
summer to review the documents taken from Mar a Lago, which temporarily deprived federal
prosecutors of access to the documents. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  Fortunately,
this bizarreness was overturned by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, but still&hellip; if
you find you're always narrowly averting disaster, you're courting disaster too closely!

&hellip; aaaannnd, breaking news: as I was writing this, 2023-Jun-09 Fri 2:30pm, I got a
notification from the venerable _Globe_ that the indictment has been
unsealed along with reactions from historians <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, and access
to the indictment document itself (and just in case it gets "disappeared" by an
unfortunate draining of a swimming pool, we've archived a copy here on
_Some Weekend Reading,_ a totally-above-suspicion CLBTNR).  <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  

A highlight:  

> “Before, during, and after his presidency, Trump has flouted the law. When he was in
> office, he purportedly destroyed documents (or had others destroy them) in violation of
> federal law,” Michael J. Gerhardt, the Burton Craige Distinguished Professor of
> Jurisprudence at University of North Carolina Law School, said by e-mail. “Since leaving
> the presidency, he has lied about the documents in his possession, and now the bill has
> come due.”  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-politico-1.jpg" width="400" height="121" alt="Shaffer @ Politico: Beschloss compares Trump to the Rosenbergs, who incurred capital punishment" title="Shaffer @ Politico: Beschloss compares Trump to the Rosenbergs, who incurred capital punishment" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The famous historian of the American presidency,
[Michael Beschloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Beschloss), when asked about
Trump and classified documents, has previously pointed out that
[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_and_Ethel_Rosenberg)
gave US nuclear secrets to Moscow and thus were executed in June 1953 for approximately
the same crime as Trump.  Here's what he had to say yesterday:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/BeschlossDC/status/1666980687767822336"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-beschloss-1.jpg" width="550" height="242" alt="Beschloss @ Twitter: The president has no more basic job than national security" title="Beschloss @ Twitter: The president has no more basic job than national security" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/BeschlossDC/status/1667122676287012864"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-beschloss-2.jpg" width="550" height="318" alt="Beschloss @ Twitter: What we need to know from Trump" title="Beschloss @ Twitter: What we need to know from Trump" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Respected Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe had this to say:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/tribelaw/status/1667010688517038080"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-tribe-1.jpg" width="550" height="509" alt="Tribe @ Twitter: The Republic strikes back" title="Tribe @ Twitter: The Republic strikes back" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Who knew Tribe was a _Star Wars_ fan who liked
[title inversions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Empire_Strikes_Back)?  


## [Things to Come](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Things_to_Come)  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-09-indictment-day-2023-Things-to-Come-UK-poster.jpg" width="256" height="389" alt="HG Wells wrote the script for 'Things to Come' based on 'The Shape of Things to Come' and 'A Story of the Days to Come'" title="HG Wells wrote the script for 'Things to Come' based on 'The Shape of Things to Come' and 'A Story of the Days to Come'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

So that's it for Indictment Day.  Should we break out the recipe for La Famiglia Scalzi's 
famous Schadenfreude Pie?  <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>  (Go ahead, click through the
footnote to the reference.  It's worth it.  I'll just wait here for you.)  

I think not, for 2 reasons:  
1. A taste for schadenfreude is a shameful thing, and so it Just Will Not Do to dive into
   it so early and so eagerly.  
2. There will be other important days to commemorate: 
   - __Arraignment Day,__ apparently next Tuesday, when Trump will have to appear in court,  
   - __Conviction Day,__ when some semblance of law and order will be restored to the US,  and
   - __Sentencing Day,__ when we can all breathe a sigh of relief and look forward to hearing 
     _nothing about the imprisoned Donald Trump ever again_ (until, perhaps, a funeral announcement).  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/scalzi-schadenfreude-pie.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="La Familia Scalzi @ Whatever: Schadenfreude Pie" title="La Familia Scalzi @ Whatever: Schadenfreude Pie" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">


Whether his wreck of the Republican Party will pull back from the brink of their Fascist 
[Cliffs of Insanity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(film)#:~:text=shot%20of%20the-,Cliffs,-of%20Insanity%20is)
is another matter.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Looking forward to Sentencing Day, and and _small_ slice of that sweet, dark and bitter
Scalzi Schadenfreude Pie.  I mean, just look at it.  Just _look_ at it!  

You?
