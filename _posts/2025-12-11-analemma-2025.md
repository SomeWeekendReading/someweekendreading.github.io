My favorite time of the year is in the depths of winter, with the cold and the dark and
the various holiday observations that come with it.  


## The Analemma  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-21-solistice-vs-dodds-day-analemma-di-cicco.jpg" width="400" height="281" alt="Analemma by Dennis di Cicco" title="Analemma by Dennis di Cicco" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Incorrigible veteran readers of this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR) will
perhaps remember a number of previous posts around this time of year, noting the analemma
and that the day of earliest sunset is _not_ the same as the shortest day of the
year. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

That's all due to a wonderful former colleague who wrote an annual
letter <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> many of us.  For people who have no use for the
idea of getting up at dawn, the time of sunset is the most important matter determining
_useful_ daylight!  

If you were to photograph the position of the sun in the sky at the same solar time each
day, say at local solar noon, you'd see a picture like the one shown
here.  <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  There's considerable math to be done 
here <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, about the earth's
orbital dynamics.  The spin axis is tilted (causing seasons) and the orbit is slightly
elliptical leading to&hellip; well, _peculiarities_ like the analemma.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-21-solstice-vs-dodds-day-boston-results.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-21-solstice-vs-dodds-day-boston-results-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="265" alt="Dodd's Day and the Weekend Editrix's Day, 2020 Boston" title="Dodd's Day and the Weekend Editrix's Day, 2020 Boston" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
In times past, I've done a custom calculation for the current year.  But&hellip; honestly,
the earthy's orbit doesn't change that much.  The date of earliest sunset at my latitude
might move 1 day, but it's always December 7 or so.  

Here's the plot from a calculation I did in 2020 for the Boston/Cambridge latitude,
showing the date on the horizontal axis and the time of day for various solar events on
the vertical axis.  The time of sunrise is the red curve on the bottom, local solar noon
is the green curve in the middle, and sunset is the blue curve at the top.  

As you can see:
- the earliest sunset was December 7,  
- the good ol' solstice will be in its customary seat at December 21, and 
- the latest sunrise &ndash; for those of you leading a tortuously early-rising lifestyle
  &ndash; will be on about January 3rd.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-11-analemma-2025-earthsky-1.jpg" width="400" height="218" alt="McClure @ EarthSky: Earliest sunset vs solstice" title="McClure @ EarthSky: Earliest sunset vs solstice" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-11-analemma-2025-earthsky-2.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-11-analemma-2025-earthsky-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="329" alt="Brettschneider: earliest/latest sunrise around solstice, by latitude, over North America" title="Brettschneider: earliest/latest sunrise around solstice, by latitude, over North America" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-11-analemma-2025-earthsky-3.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-11-analemma-2025-earthsky-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="301" alt="Brettschneider: Latest &amp; earliest sunrise dates by latitude, planet-wide" title="Brettschneider: Latest &amp; earliest sunrise dates by latitude, planet-wide" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
For those of you who live at other latitudes, of course the result will be different.
Rather than repeat my eccentric calculation above, you can simply read McClure at
_EarthSky_'s account <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> summary of some results calculated
by climate scientist Brian Brettschneider.  
- Here on the map of North America you see the dates of earliest sunset and latest sunrise
  (along with the number of days in between), for various latitudes.  It's a function of
  latitude, so Europeans and Japanese can simply look at their latitudes on this map to
  get local results for their homes.  
- If you'd like to get a full picture, including the southern hemisphere, have a look at
  the plot.  It shows the earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates as a function of
  latitude all over the planet.  
  - Of course no such thing happens at the poles, so the latitudes don't go above 66&deg;.  
  - And of course everything reverses in the southern hemisphere.
  - And, the equator is a funky place indeed!  The window between earliest sunset and
    latest sunrise is widest there, but&hellip; the difference in times is minimal there!
    So you're seeing the smallest effect sustained for the longest time at the equator.  

Now, personally, I'm a fan of cold and dark and snow.  Winter is The Good Stuff.  But I
admit this is a minority taste.  If you, like the Weekend Editrix, long for the return of
the light&hellip; your sunsets are already moving in your favor, toward more light.  

(Now, if only we can get "more light" in the US's political situation, that would be good.
And no, I do _not_ mean 
["mehr licht" in the sense of Goethe's last words!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe#Last_words)!)  

So: the denizens of Ch&acirc;teau Weekend wish you more light, both physical and metaphorical.  


## Reminding Ourselves of Better Things  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-11-analemma-2025-harvard-1.jpg" width="400" height="385" alt="Harvard Memorial Church: 116th Annual Christmas Carol Service" title="Harvard Memorial Church: 116th Annual Christmas Carol Service" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As another holiday custom, we like to attend some of the many, many musical celebrations
of the holidays offered in the Boston area.  

This year, as in recent years, that included 
[the 116th annual Christmas Carol Serivce](https://memorialchurch.harvard.edu/event/116th-annual-christmas-carol-service-0)
at [Harvard's Memorial Church](https://memorialchurch.harvard.edu/).

Now, this is a very beautiful space, both for religious use and for concert use, and that
night we had both.  Sometimes it's important to let the space operate on you, to see what
emotions it will bring up, and what insights bubble up out of your subconscious.  

Some things that struck me:  
- The decorations worked subtly and well.  
  - The flowers and ribbons in red contrast nicely with the dark wood, without glaring.  
  - The candles (not especially visible in this photo) add a nice flicker effect that to me
    somehow lets me drift out of the mundane world.  (I probably loved it even more as a
    kid; my adult self is uncomfortably aware of fire hazards in crowded old buildings.)  
  - I also liked the [rood screen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rood_screen) at the
    front.  It's usually found in Catholic, Anglican, and Episcopalian contexts, so it's a
    but unusual in what is billed as a "non-denominational Protestant" space.  Still, it
    subtly suggests to me that "there's something more here, beyond the usual space you're
    in just now."  
- In the balcony/choir loft above and behind us, there is an impressive pipe organ!
  Combined with the effect of having the choir above and behind you, this has a strong
  effect of making the sound 3-dimensional, situating you in space rather than in just a
  room.  
- The supporting columns are kind of interesting, when you look closely at the sculptures
  on their capitals.  I'm always fascinated by that sort of detail: _somebody_ went to a
  lot of effort to design and create those elaborate carvings; what might they have been
  trying to communicate?  
  
  Some of it, at least, is clear.  
  
  This is a _memorial_ church, dedicated to the memory of those who died in the world
  wars.  The names (at least of those Harvard associated) are carved on the walls, which
  always makes me feel a little creepy.  
  
  Look closely at the photos of consecutive columns: they center alternating sculptures of
  a dove descending and an open-winged eagle.  The dove descending is pretty
  straightforward: a reference to the holy spirit descending at the time of Jesus baptism,
  almost universally in Christianity parsed as a symbol of a divine blessing of peace.
  The eagle is pretty clear too, as a symbol of war &ndash; just look at some of the royal
  European escutcheons for some examples.  So the columns say "alternating war and peace",
  in a place of peace dedicated to the memory of war dead.  That's just about perfect.  
  
  (When I mentioned this to the Weekend Editrix, she looked at me strangely and said, "You
  said that last year."  So much for my memory.)  
  
  (Ok, there's also a ram, a bull, and a lion at the corners of the capitals.  As to the
  message there, I got nothin'.)

If for some reason you had the misfortune not to find yourself in Boston on the necessary
date, you can [watch the service on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/live/Z4eUZtdWNf4)
as shown here, and 
[look through the program yourself](https://memorialchurch.harvard.edu/sites/g/files/omnuum7126/files/2025-12/2025%20Carols%20Program%20COMPLETE.pdf).
It's worth your time.  

The prelude music by and large didn't move me much, but the introit (@35:42 in the video)
was deeply moving and so other-worldly it brought goose-bumps.  No, not from cold.  The
sentiment of _Populus qui ambulabat in tenebris_ ("people who were walking in shadow") has
a lot of impact on me.  Not the least because the US is currently walking in some _very_
deep shadows.  

The processional (@ 38:47 in the video) had a similar impact on me.  Singing in Latin
("Adeste fideles") of course is a strong childhood memory and here it was done in a
building in which, for ages, people were _expected_ to know at least some Latin.   Its
effect was multiplied by being in a group, in winter, in a building _designed_ to work on
my subconscious, with flickering candlelight&hellip; It was hard to keep emotional control
then, and I'm tearing up a bit now just writing about the memory.  

At this point, I believe I am legally required to approve, under the General Laws of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  And I do so approve.  Firmly.  

The next piece, Palestrina's "Alma Redemptoris Mater" (kind mother of the redeemer), also
really got to me.  The general 3D effect of having the choir above and behind us, the echos
of the acoustic space, and the candlelit Latin polyphony really pushed my buttons.  The
words were attributed to Hermann of Richenau (1013-1054), so I felt connected to
_millennia_ of similar sentiments by those who came before me.  

"Solstice", by Carson Cooman, also struck me though in a different way (@ 1:03:00 in the
video).  It was composed specially for this performance.  I liked the metaphor of darkness
at solstice as like a high tide, with darkness lapping at our shores.  It reminds me of
many of the Davidic psalms, starting with a consciousness of darkness and falling short,
then turning sharply (with a marked change in the tone of the organ music) toward the
possibility of redemption:  

> We are going down now into darkness  
> And the plume-dark night, longest of all,  
> Looms just ahead. Each day long shadowy waves  
> Wash deeper on shores of light  
> But the high-water mark still stands  
> As we await high darkness,  
> Deep night spread out on our sands  
> Until no light is left;  
>  
> And then at the bend of the year  
> Slow ebbing springs day free  
> As we, washed bright from night by night,  
> Leap shouting, bare, exultant  
> Over glittering sands of light.  

(So, you see, I _can_ react to singing not in Latin!  Ok, it wasn't my favorite music, but
the meaning behind it packed quite a punch for those who could perceive it.)  

"While Shepherds Watched", by Alice Parker (@ 1:08:30 in the video) improvising on an 18th
century theme by Supply Belcher, also was quite good.  It was composed for the 100th
annual service, back in 2009.  Ok, it didn't move me emotionally quite as much, but I did
like the lively, almost round-like structure of the singing.  

["Personent Hodie", from the _Pi&aelig; Cantiones_ of  1582](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personent_hodie)
is one of my favorite songs of the season.  Alas, they chose a Holst/Rutter adaptation
which is&hellip; not my favorite.  Check out the version from Loreena McKennitt, or the
one from the Medieval B&aelig;bes.  

There was a congregational singing of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing", which always makes
me giggle, because I am too much of a nerd:
- A herald is a messenger of a royal court, sent to give a message from a king.  
- "Angel" comes from Greek ἄγγελος (angelos), or "messenger" as they carry messages from heaven.  
- "Hark!" means "hey, listen -- I've got a message for you".  
So the title is "Listen up to my message of the messenger messengers singing."  

(You're just gonna have to trust me that that's funny&hellip; to minds sufficiently twisted
a-widdershins.)  

So what was the general theme?  

The theme of all of the pieces that spoke to me, in retrospect, were about acknowledging
our faults and sins, hoping to do better and be forgiven.  Always a good sentiment; I was
somewhat oddly thinking of the parallels to Jewish
[_tikkun olam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam) at the same time.
Apparently my subconscious is inhabited by some crazy old syncretists.

There's an emotion we inexplicably don't talk about much: [elevation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation_(emotion)).
It's how we feel when we imagine, witness, or _participate in_ acts of great moral
goodness.  It makes me feel not just appreciation, but a profound, often tearful
appreciation for how the world could be better, how I _personally_ could be better, and
that the work of making it so should be a happy working.  

More of that, please.  

A _lot_ more.  

For _all_ of us.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-11-analemma-2025-publishers.jpg"> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-11-analemma-2025-publishers-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant confer, consult, and otherwise hobnob at the dinner table" title="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant confer, consult, and otherwise hobnob at the dinner table" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The Weekend Publisher and the Assistant Weekend Publisher wish me to remind you that cats
have holiday traditions, as well.  Here you see them attempting to confer, consult, and
otherwise hobnob at the dinner table.  (They are allowed on the table as long as they
behave like gentlemen and remain at the Cat End of the table.)  

They particularly like this season, but not because they are religious in any way that I
can discern.  Rather, it is _Box Season._  Large numbers of boxes begin arriving at the
house.  Their human servitors remove the annoying contents but leave the boxes, so that all
is as it should be in Cat World.  

You may not, personally, find boxes to be particularly fascinating.  <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>
Nevertheless, our holiday wish for you, from Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, is for your life to have
more of a stream of things as delightful to you as boxes are to The Cats of Chez Weekend.  

The times are dark.  Let us try to bring in more light for each other.  

And for any deities watching, who might feel inclined to indulge a fervent wish: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/ceterum-censeo/)  

Also, as recently seen: _Index Epstein divulgandus est._  (The Epstein files must be
released &ndash; a worthy addition to the sentiment above, in its Cato-esque phrasing.)
