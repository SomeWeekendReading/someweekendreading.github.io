[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about Biden's State of the
Union address.  _\*Sigh\*&hellip;_  


## The actual speech  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-02-09-sotu-2023-thoughts-umair-1.jpg" width="400" height="144" alt="Haque @ Eudaimonia &amp; Co.: Biden's SoTU was historic" title="Haque @ Eudaimonia &amp; Co.: Biden's SoTU was historic" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Biden's speech?  It was pretty great.  He's clearly a master of rhetoric: he anticipated
when Republicans would act like petulant children, and built some verbal jiu-jitsu into
his speech to exploit this.  

And it's not just me saying that: even the reliably dour-but-regrettably-accurate Umair
says so.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

His summary of his summary:  
> Biden did something incredibly important. I don’t use the word “incredibly” lightly. He
> made the link between politics — one model of organizing the global economy, in which
> America’s middle class was effectively sacrificed to cheap labour — and economics — that
> led to widespread stagnation, and a fall in living standards — and society.  

'Bout time!  


## Prominent Republican reaction  

Of course, it's hard to pay attention to serious matters when the Republicans are intent
on staging a circus on the back benches.  In the immortal words of Jack
Hardy's song "Out of Control" <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>:  

> You don't have to run away to join the circus  
> The circus is right here and it swallowed you whole

It's difficult to stand out against the background of the clown car, but Rep. Marjorie
Taylor Greene was up to the challenge.  One might wonder "why is she like that?", and
Calabro's article in _The Atlantic_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> does give a few sad
insights into her rather narrow world.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-02-09-sotu-2023-thoughts-mtg-cnn-1.jpg" width="400" height="127" alt="LeBlanc @ CNN: MTG spits conspiracy hate in face of Parkland shooting survivor" title="LeBlanc @ CNN: MTG spits conspiracy hate in face of Parkland shooting survivor" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-02-09-sotu-2023-thoughts-mtg-the-hill-1.jpg" width="400" height="185" alt="Mueller @ The Hill: MTG would have armed the insurrectionists" title="Mueller @ The Hill: MTG would have armed the insurrectionists" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Keep in mind this is the woman spat conspiracy hate in the face of a survivor of the
Parkland shooting. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  She said of the 2021-Jan-06
insurrection that the main problem was that if she had planned it, the insurrectionists
"would've been armed". <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  

Such is the [_cursus honorum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursus_honorum) of the
degenerate remains of the Republican party.  

That's not all, of course; it's just the tip of the iceberg to give you the general idea.
This is not only a right-wing whackaloon, but likely actually delusional.  Alas, this
is the face of about half the Republican party; the other half is cowed into submission to
their paranoid vision.  

So: starting from _there,_ how did she so distinguish herself at the SoTU address from the
rest of the clown car passengers?  

By performative outrage, mostly.  She tried to bring in a white balloon, to remind
everyone about the Chinese spy balloon.  She also dressed all in white, perhaps hoping
herself to be mistaken for the balloon.  (Note to MTG: cosplaying a foreign spy device at
a high-security constitutionally mandated function of the US government shows&hellip;
_questionable_ judgment.)  

She also screamed a lot, with her ultra-MAGA colleagues attempting to disrupt the State of
the Union address.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-02-09-sotu-2023-thoughts-mtg-egyptian-white-vulture.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-02-09-sotu-2023-thoughts-mtg-egyptian-white-vulture-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="475" alt="MTG @ SoTU: Comparison with Egyptian white vulture" title="MTG @ SoTU: Comparison with Egyptian white vulture" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
She is shown here, in full-throated scream, spraying about her a toxic venom of accusatory
irrelevancies and lies.  (More about the inset in a moment.)  

The arguably tasteless fur collar has been compared by Twitter wags to the costume of
the cartoon character [Cruella de Vil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruella_de_Vil).
I liked better the classical comparison, by a friend and former colleague, to a
[harpy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harpy), described by Hesiod as woman/vulture hybrids
whose job was to torment mortals in various stupidly violent ways.  

While I am somewhat loathe to criticize a woman based on appearance or clothing, she has
worked so hard to earn our opprobrium that it would be a shame to deprive her of the
fruits of her labor.  After all, MTG's humanity, as revealed by her expressed preferences
and cruel behaviors, is rather in question.  As the harpies were half-human, they may not
be the proper comparator.  

For a bit more verisimilitude employing a full vulture, I commend to your attention the
juvenile [Egyptian white vulture](https://www.google.com/search?q=egyptian+white+vulture),
shown inset for your comparison.  (The vulture is the one whose mouth is closed, not
spewing nonsense at us.)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

This is all frightening enough, until you consider an even more frightening thought: about
1/4 of the US electorate _likes_ this, and votes for people like her, repeatedly.  

Honestly, I dunno.  This is so badly broken I have little clue how to fix it.
