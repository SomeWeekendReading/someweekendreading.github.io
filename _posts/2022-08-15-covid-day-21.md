Are we there yet?  Are we there yet?  Are we there yet?  


## Thinking negatively, testing&hellip; positively (slightly)  

Today I was feeling better, and in fact had some dental surgery scheduled.  So when I
dully tested this morning, within the required 15 minutes there was no positive T stripe.
My dentist didn't seem interested beyond polite conversation, and was wearing elaborate
PPE anyway.

But&hellip; when I got home a couple hours later, the test looked like this: with a bit more
time to cure, a faint T stripe appeared.  

It appears I am still cursed with a positive mental attitude.  Fortunately, my dentist
seems to believe appropriate precautions were taken.  

Now we gotta go buy some more tests!  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

We're not there yet.  The Weekend Editrix is just post-paxlovid, with fading symptoms.
We're hoping for no rebound effect for her.
