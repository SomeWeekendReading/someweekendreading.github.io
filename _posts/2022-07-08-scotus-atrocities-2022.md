The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) has a 6-3 conservative majority.  Have
they gotten any different as a result?  


## A general sense of foreboding  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-08-scotus-atrocities-2022-wapo-1.jpg" width="400" height="205" alt="Ignatius @ WaPo: A general sense of foreboding in the US" title="Ignatius @ WaPo: A general sense of foreboding in the US" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
David Ignatius writes at the _WaPo_ on the genereal sense of foreboding many Americans now
have <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

> What does our national portrait look like on this Independence Day? Many of us see an
> angry, traumatized face, rather than the radiant glow of the Founders. That’s the odd
> thing about this hyperpartisan moment: Nearly every American, whatever their political
> perspective, has a foreboding that the country they love is losing its way.  

Now, I understand why liberals and independents are traumatized: we're watching
knucklehead theocrats drag the country back into the pre-Enlightenment mud.  But why are
the conservatives traumatized, when they're getting all the destruction for which they've
lusted, these many years?  

And it's not just a government problem, it's in the private sector, education, and healthcare, too:  

> It isn’t just a government problem, though. Private-sector productivity has been
> stagnant for decades, and corporations struggle with __bureaucracy and bloat__. Universities
> spend __nearly as much on administration as teaching,__ and administrative costs account for
> __a third of total health-care spending__.  

Ask any private sector employee about management bloat with all the MBAs.  Ask any
professor about the crushing burden of yet more administrators.  Ask any doctor about
paperwork and reporting in general.  

Ignatius concludes:  

> Some people get so angry they want to burn the house down and start over.  
>  
> We’re not at that cataclysmic point yet. I see positive signs in the slow but growing
> Republican willingness to challenge Donald Trump, and in the broad, bipartisan anger at
> the extremism of recent Supreme Court decisions. But bad things can happen to good
> countries, as our modern history shows.  

Still&hellip; I thought conservatives were getting _their chance_ to "burn the house down",
to use Ignatius's phrase. Don't flames make nihilists happy with their arson?  Are they so
delusional they _still_ think they're victims?  Is the prospect of Democrats having even a
_sliver_ of power, not even enough to govern as is the case now, so threatening?  


## How partisan is SCOTUS, historically speaking?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-08-scotus-atrocities-2022-538-1.jpg" width="400" height="160" alt="Thomson-DeVeaux &amp; Bronner @ 538: SCOTUS more sharply divided than in generations" title="Thomson-DeVeaux &amp; Bronner @ 538: SCOTUS more sharply divided than in generations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Thomson-DeVeaux &amp; Bronner write at _538_ that the SCOTUS is now more divided politically
than it's been in generations <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, thanks to 50 years of
effort by Republicans to pack the court with extremists.  

Their analysis is pretty clear:  

> The conservatives answered by delivering the most far-reaching slew of rulings in modern
> memory. It’s now abundantly clear that Trump’s appointees are in control of this court,
> and they’re not searching for consensus. In fact, the divide between the court’s
> Republican and Democratic appointees is deeper than it’s been in the modern era.  

Keep in mind that "modern era" means "since the American Civil War", so don't take a great
deal of comfort from Republicans stopping just short of violent insurrection and civil
war.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-08-scotus-atrocities-2022-538-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-08-scotus-atrocities-2022-538-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="310" alt="Thomson-DeVeaux &amp; Bronner @ 538: SCOTUS decisions are now more nakedly partisan than since 1953" title="Thomson-DeVeaux &amp; Bronner @ 538: SCOTUS decisions are now more nakedly partisan than since 1953" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Cold, hard data supports this: Thomson-DeVeaux &amp; Bronner point out that historically,
about half of SCOTUS decisions are unanimous, and those exactly along partisan blocs are
rarer.  No longer, as shown in this plot of the % decisions unanimous and partisan bloc
over time since 1953.  This is clearly a SCOTUS in a pathological state.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-08-scotus-atrocities-2022-538-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-08-scotus-atrocities-2022-538-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="Thomson-DeVeaux &amp; Bronner @ 538: Martin-Quinn scores show Kavanaugh as ideologically median justice?!" title="Thomson-DeVeaux &amp; Bronner @ 538: Martin-Quinn scores show Kavanaugh as ideologically median justice?!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
And it's not just the group behavior that's lurched far right, either.  Individual
justices can be rated ideologically by a bit of math called the
[Martin-Quinn score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin-Quinn_score).  

(__NB:__ Back in 2003, shortly after they published their paper using Markov Chain Monte
Carlo regression <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, I had some brief correspondence with
Kevin Quinn about the [MCMCpack package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCMCpack/index.html)
in [R](https://www.r-project.org/).  I was doing something similar in genomics at the time.
He came off as quite competent, collegial, and affable to me.  If you think that biases my
opinion in Martin &amp; Quinn's favor, feel free to think that.)  

As you can see here, _Kavanaugh_ is likely to be the median justice now, despicable as
he may be.  The Supremes are just _that_ highly right-wing biased nowadays!  

In fact, about half of the ideologically polarized opinions were written by 2 of the
court's most extreme right-wingers: Alito (21%) and Thomas (29%).  That's the polluted far-right
source of new nudges to our law.  


## Do the SCOTUS decisions hit home personally?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-08-scotus-atrocities-2022-nyt-1.jpg" width="400" height="161" alt="Liptak &amp; Kao @ NYT: Major SCOTUS decisions of the 2022 term" title="Liptak &amp; Kao @ NYT: Major SCOTUS decisions of the 2022 term" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Ok, but does that resonate personally: do I as a progressive liberal feel that way, when
confronted with a list of this term's SCOTUS decisions?  To find out, we peruse the
helpful list of major decisions this term by Liptak &amp; Kao at the
_NYT_.  <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  Let's go over them and register a personal
reaction to each one negative, neutral, good: AARGH/MEH/YAY.  

1. __Climate change:__ _W Va v EPA_.  The court gutted regulatory agency ability to
   regulate much of anything, in particular broad regulations over the energy sector.
   They now require Congress to weigh in on all the minutiae, specifying every single
   regulation and level of pollutant, which will of course never happen.  Solid
   __AARGH__.  Conservative bloc decision.  
2. __Immigration:__ _Biden v Texas_.  Allows Biden administration to end Trump-era rules
   called "remain in Mexico".  Marginal __YAY__.  Split decision.  
3. __Native Americans:__ _Oklahoma v Castro-Huerta_.  Much of Oklahoma is a Native
   American reservation, and much law enforcement is tribal.  The Court allows state
   authorities to prosecute crimes committed by non-Native Americans committing crimes
   against Native Americans there, creating a conflict with tribal enforcement.  Honestly,
   I dunno here: I'm in favor of tribal independence, but don't understand the issue.  So,
   __MEH__.  Split decision, because of Gorsuch.  
4. __School prayer:__ _Kennedy v Bremerton Sch Distr_.  A more than usually
   knuckleheaded high school football coach wanted to pray in the middle of the football
   field after games.  He wished to do so in public.  He also wished to invite players
   "who wanted to join" to do so.  This was in spite of their being his subordinates utterly
   dependent on him, which impairs their ability to consent.  The court inexplicably
   thinks this is ok, in spite of the obviously coercive element of the coach using his 
   public employment to encourage a particular religion.  Solid __AARGH__.  Conservative
   bloc decision.  
5. __Abortion rights:__ _Dobbs vs Jackson Women's Health Organization_.  Need we say more
   than that the court wishes, essentially for religious and right-wing policy preference
   reasons, to remove a basic civil right enshrined in American law for almost half a
   century?  Solid, gold-plated __AARGH__!  Conservative bloc decision.  
6. __Guns:__  _NY State Rifle &amp; Pistol Assn v Bruen_.  New York required people to show
   a good reason for a public concealed carry permit for guns.  The Supremes say basically
   no, everybody can have guns everywhere.  This is as stupid as it is evil.  Absolutely
   rock-solid __AARGH__.  Conservative bloc decision.  
7. __Church/State separation:__ _Carson v Makin_.  Supremes rule that a Maine state
   tuition program must also pay tuition to religious schools.  I mean, c'mon, this isn't
   even hard: the answer is no.  Still, the court ruled in favor.  Solid __AARGH__.
   Conservative bloc decision.  
8. __1st Amendment and public fora:__ _Shurtleff v Boston:_ Groups periodically ask Boston
   to fly their flag at City Hall, just for the good feels.  The city refused a flag from
   a Christian group, though it allowed other causes.  The court says they have to do it,
   in the name of even-handedness.  I'll give it a marginal __YAY__, since this seems fair
   (though I wonder what would happen if a neo-Nazi group tried this).  Unanimous
   decision.  
9. __1st Amendement and censures:__ _Houston Comm Coll Sys v Wilson_.  The
   court rules elected bodies are on solid ground when they choose to censure a member.
   Seems solid.  Conditional __YAY__.  Unanimous decision.  
10. __Religion &amp; death penalty:__  _Ramirez v Collier_.  Prisons are not allowed to
    deprive prisoners being executed from contact with clergy, even being touched.  Again,
    seems pretty good.  Solid __YAY__.  (Though&hellip; can we just abolish the stupid death
    penalty?  Then the cruelty here just goes away.)  Split decision, because Thomas was
    the lone dissenter who wanted prisoners to die without contact with clergy.  
11. __State secrets:__  _US v Zubaydah_.  Zubaydah was tortured, but the US is not
    required to say exactly where that happened.  Eh&hellip; once you start torturing
    people, in my mind that's a crime and you don't get to conceal _anything._  Security
    is useful, but I'm giving this a marginal __AARGH__.  Split decision.  
12. __Executive privilege:__ _Trump v Thompson_.  Former "president" Trump does not any
    longer have executive privilege to block release of documents to the J6 committee.
    Absolutely right.  Solid __YAY__.  Split decision, because Thomas wants Trump to have
    power forever.  
13. __Workplaces and COVID-19:__ _Natl Fed of Indep Bus v. Labor Dept_.  Supremes reject
    Biden's mandate of vaccination or testing at large employers.  Absolutely, suicidally
    stupid.  Big, honkin' loud __AARGH__.  Conservative bloc decision.  
14. __Healthcare facilities and COVID-19:__  _Biden v Missouri_.  Upholds Biden mandate
    that healthcare facilities receiving federal money must not be stupid, and thus should
    vaccinate workers.  Solid __YAY__, though puzzling why this one differed from the
    previous.  Employers are somehow allowed to subject workers and customers to risk of
    death?!  Split decision.  

So out of 14 cases important enough to be summarized by the _Times,_ we got:
- __YAY:__ 6  
- __MEH:__ 1  
- __AARGH:__ 7  

If I give them the benefit of the doubt on the Native American thing (where I'm just
ignorant), then it's about 50% evil and stupid decisions.  

That's&hellip; _breathtaking._  Especially so when we consider the degree to which these bad
decisions were almost all the result of the conservative bloc taking away fundamental
rights.  

But: is my concern here just the general result of the cases, or is it specifically due to
the conservative bloc votes?  

We can look at that too, with a crosstabulation of YAY/MEH/AARGH assessments with whether
the case was conservative bloc, split decision, or unanimous. (There can be no liberal
bloc, since they're a decided minority.)  That leads to the following 3x3
[crosstabluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingency_table) and
[Fisher exact test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%27s_exact_test) in

	Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data

data:  tbl
p-value = 0.005162
alternative hypothesis: two.sided
```

- The first output is just a table of the above data, giving the case, my feelings about
  it, and whether it was a bloc/split/unanimous decision.  
- The second output is the crosstabulation, giving the count of cases with the given
  assessment by me on the rows and the decision type on the column.  
  - As you can see, almost all my "AARGH" problems are due to conservative bloc
    decisions.  
  - The single exception was _US v Zubaydah_, where it really was kind of split in a way I
    just don't understand.  
- Finally, we performed a Fisher exact test: the null hypothesis is that my feelings are
  unrelated to the bloc/not-bloc nature of the decision; the alternative hypothesis is
  that the _are_ related.  The verdict, with a $p$-value of $p \sim 0.5\%$, is that they
  are in fact related.  
  
So, yeah: I'm steamed about those Team Evil bloc votes.

Time to eliminate the filibuster, expand the court, and maybe impeach a few of the more
problematic justices.  Thomas, with his compromised ethical position comes to mind: why
should he sit on the court when his wife is an activist in the matters before him?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-08-scotus-atrocities-2022-lowe-1.jpg" width="400" height="218" alt="Lowe @ In the Pipeline: Tribalisms" title="Lowe @ In the Pipeline: Tribalisms" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Esteemed med-chem blogger Derek Lowe weighed in on the July 4th weekend about our
increasingly tribal identities in the US.  <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  (Plus, extra
special bonus points for recognizing and applying
[Russel's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox) to the problem!)  

He describes his tribal identity at first humorously, and then:  

> I'm white, I'm male, I just reached the 60-and-over demographic, I used to often vote
> Republican but don't see how I can ever do that again, I don't think that the last
> election was stolen. And so on. That's where the arguing starts.  

(Yeah, I grew up Republican, too.  But it's possible to get over that and get better.  I
promise, life gets better afterward.)  

His description of his attitude to life is almost _exactly_ a description of

Yes, we have a sense of foreboding, because the conservatives are spreading fascism, or in
Lowe's words, _"poisonous garbage"._  We must, following Karl Popper's terminology from
the Open Society <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, be 
[intolerant of intolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance).
