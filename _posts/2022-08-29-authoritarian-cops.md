Cops in the US are a hot mess of authoritarianism, viewing themselves as an occupying
army.  They're sufficiently out of hand that the "defund the police" movement is starting
to look like the side with the cool-headed, sensible arguments.  

## _Apologia pro vita mea_  

First, let me apologize for infrequent posting.  Post-COVID syndrome is a thing, you
know.  I get _extreme_ fatigue each afternoon and become non-functional.  Before that
there's the brain fog, making even simple tasks difficult.  It's hard to take apart a
paper from the scientific literature, check its conclusions statistically, and then
formulate a clear opinion to write up!  

We're getting better slowly, here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend.  Please be patient.  

Also, this is a pretty angry post.  Be forewarned.  


## Background on Authoritarianism  

Back in the 1980s, the rather silly Reagan strand of Republicans began to dominate the
party.  I shrugged, decided I'd outgrown the Republican phase of my life, and became a
Democrat.  That was the first phase of my transition to becoming a progressive.  (Yeah, I
know: I wasn't born this way, but I got here as fast as I could.  Sorry it took the first
1/3 of my life.)  

But then, in the 90s, it dawned on me that the rhetoric of American Republicans was
getting _angrier_, and by a lot.  Also, they were becoming vastly more authoritarian:
viewing themselves as the _only_ legitimate authority regardless of election outcomes,
creating crisis after crisis to force right-wing policies down unwilling throats, a whiny
claim of persecuted victim status despite holding vast power, and a generally nihilistic
and personality cult approach to power.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-29-authoritarian-cops-hofstadter-1.jpg" width="200" height="290" alt="Hofstadter: The Paranoid Style in American Politics" title="***Hofstadter: The Paranoid Style in American Politics" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
If I'd thought about it &ndash; and I did not, at the time &ndash; I'd have realized that
this strain of politics of the id had been common in American politics.  Richard
[Hofstadter's famous essay, "The Paranoid Style in American Politics"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paranoid_Style_in_American_Politics) <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
(later collected into a book of essays shown here) opened thus:  

> American politics has often been an arena for angry minds. In recent years we have seen
> angry minds at work mainly among extreme right-wingers, who have now demonstrated in the
> Goldwater movement how much political leverage can be got out of the animosities and
> passions of a small minority.  

He was of course speaking of the Goldwater campaign in 1964, with its full flowering of
paranoid xenophobia and embrace of the possibility of nuclear war.  As a kid, I knew
_something_ was wrong there, but didn't quite get _what_ was wrong.  I grew up in a
Republican family, and thought that made my decisions for me.  So, yeah: I get the
tribalism thing, but am an example that it's possible to grow out of it.  

It's been described as one of the most important and most influential articles published
in the 155 year history of [Harper's]".  On the other hand, there's some evidence that it
has become a playbook for several right-wing figures, seeking to work the volatile
resentments and emotions of conservatives.  One of the best modern examples of Hofstadter's
"paranoid style" is QAnon.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-29-authoritarian-cops-adorno-1.jpg" width="200" height="297" alt="TW Adorno, The Authoritarian Personality" title="TW Adorno, The Authoritarian Personality" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Back to the 90s: I was surprised that the study of "the authoritarian personality" had a
rich literature.  That's not surprising, given the concerns of WWII where everyone wanted
to now, more or less, "what the hell just happened?!" That was the study of Adorno, _et
al._'s groundbreaking study _The Authoritarian Personality_. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

This book rapidly became holy writ in political science circles.  It's an excruciating
1,000 pages or so in length, and I've personally only painfully excruciated my way through
maybe 300-400 pages, concentrating on the tables.  Still, the conclusion was clear: fascism
finds fertile ground among those with incandescent fury against current authority figures,
an idolatrous adoration for their chosen replacement authority figures, and a deep, racist
hostility toward anyone who might be part of an outgroup.  

They tend to be racist (usually white supremacist), take patriotism to xenophobic
extremes, are fascinated by a cult of personality, have an aggrieved sense of perceived
injury, feel they have a natural inalienable right to power over all others, and
prioritize defense of their tribe as the ultimate good.  

That's pretty much fascism.  Adorno and colleagues attempted to construct a psychological
test to measure objectively who fit that pattern and to what degree.  This became their
famous _F_-scale instrument.  They also developed scales for anti-semitism, ethnocentrism,
and political &amp; economic conservatism extremes.  

The attributes of the _F_-scale were, as [summarized on Wikipedia with nice succinctness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Authoritarian_Personality#F_Scale), more or less like modern conservative Republican attitudes:  
> - __Conventionalism:__ Adherence to conventional values.  
> - __Authoritarian Submission:__ Towards ingroup authority figures.  
> - __Authoritarian Aggression:__ Against people who violate conventional values.  
> - __Anti-Intraception:__ Opposition to subjectivity and imagination.  
> - __Superstition and Stereotypy:__ Belief in individual fate; thinking in rigid categories.  
> - __Power and Toughness:__ Concerned with submission and domination; assertion of strength.  
> - __Destructiveness and Cynicism:__ hostility against human nature.  
> - __Projectivity:__ Perception of the world as dangerous; tendency to project unconscious impulses.  
> - __Sex:__ Overly concerned with modern sexual practices.  

That more or less summed things up for me, in the early 1990s.  As a then-housemate
summarized, "It sort of makes me sick to my stomach to think people can be like that."
Amen, brother.  Amen.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-29-authoritarian-cops-altemeyer-1.jpg" width="200" height="289" alt="R Altemeyer, The Authoritarians" title="R Altemeyer, The Authoritarians" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Then somehow I stumbled across Bob Altemeyer, and his book
_The Authoritarians_.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

He's a political scientist who made his entire career studying the authoritarian
personality.  The book is a semi-popular summary of his entire research career's findings,
in language people who aren't psychologists and political scientists can swallow.  

It was mind-opening for me.  

Importantly, he reacted &ndash; badly &ndash; as I did to the Freudian basis of Adorno's
_F_-scale.  Yes, Freud was intellectually popular then, but all that reads like
pseudoscience today.  So Altemeyer's _RWA_ scale ("right-wing authoritarian") is much more
principled and founded in objective statistics about personality types without speculating
about childhood treatment by fathers and mothers.  

His vision for the political trajectory of the US starting in the 1990s is terrifying.
Donald Trump is the archetype of the authoritarian dominator (AD), and his acolytes are
clearly the authoritarian followers (AF) types that Altemeyer measures.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-29-authoritarian-cops-haidt-1.jpg" width="200" height="304" alt="Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind" title="Jonathan Haidt, The Righteous Mind" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Then,  Jonathan Haidt, in _The Righteous Mind_ <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> in 2013,
helped make it all clearer for me.  

He applied something akin to [factor analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis)
to data on how people made moral decisions.  While I have little patience for his
"rationalist delusion" stuff, he did make a major contribution to how we think about
morality.  He ended up with 5 significant factors, upon each of us rely to varying
degrees.  The first 2 are universal, while the last 3 are almost exclusive to more
conservative authoritarian people:  

- __Harm vs Care:__ We should avoid harm where possible, and care for people as we can.  
- __Fairness:__ We should treat people on an equal basis, where possible.  
- __Submission to Authority:__ It's best to follow the leader and do what they say.  
- __Defense of the Ingroup/Hostility to Outgroup:__ It's best to defend the tribe, and be
  suspicious or even violent to outsiders.  
- __Purity:__ It's important to cultivate a taste for what's disgusting to avoid it, and
  what's pure to encourage it.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-29-authoritarian-cops-haidt-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-29-authoritarian-cops-haidt-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Haidt: schema of factor loadings on moral foundations vs political group" title="Haidt: schema of factor loadings on moral foundations vs political group" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The correlation of factor loadings on these 5 moral foundations factors vs political group
is stark.  Shown here is an (illustrative, unlikely to be quantitatively detailed) graph
from Wikipedia.  Note that conservatives value all 5 factors, whereas liberals tend to use
only the harm/care and fairness.  
- Conservatives tend to pounce gleefully and say things like this is proof that liberals
  are morally defective, since they miss 3/5 of everything righteous in the world.  
- Liberals, on the other hand, tend to look at authority submission, xenophobia/outgroup
  hostility, and elaborate rituals of purity as character _defects._  Your humble Weekend
  Editor certainly feels that way, and the quote from the old housemate above is another
  anecdotal example.  
  
So the fundamental discord is: conservative authoritarians regard as foundational to their
morality 3 aspects which the vast majority regard as _character defects_ which border on
being wrong in and of themselves.  


## The Awful Consequences on Policing in The Present  

So that's 4 books worth &ndash; literally &ndash; of where I'm coming from with regard to
the perils of authoritarians in general and Republicans in particular.

How does that reflect on our problems with police violence?  Huffing on a vial of
Republican/authoritarian entitled rage can't be leading to a good place.  Let's look at
some news items from just this month:  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-29-authoritarian-cops-wapo-1.jpg" width="400" height="163" alt="Kornfeld @ WaPo: Indiana cops and political intimidation" title="Kornfeld @ WaPo: Indiana cops and political intimidation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- The _WaPo_ has a truly nauseating article about police in Indiana engaging in
  _direct intimidation_ <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> to remove a political
  candidate from a race.  

  Because the candidate favored body cameras, which were the
  standard of practice in all neighboring communities, the police decided he was
  "anti-cop".  Apparently they do not like being held responsible for their actions by
  having a video record.  Hence in July they trumped up charges against the politician
  (that were previously rejected by prosecutors as having no evidence) and arrested him,
  amid threats if he did not withdraw from the race.  
  
  Think it through: a political candidate advocates for police body cameras, and is
  shortly after that slandered with a false charge, arrested, threatened with police
  harassment unless he withdraws from a race for being "anti-cop".  
  
  That's not police.  That's Gestapo, the enforcement arm of fascists.  

  (Also in Indiana, long the home of my family, they have elected [a right-wing US senator who believes the Supreme Court decision allowing inter-racial marriages was wrongly decided]({{ site.baseurl }}/republicans-against-interracial-marriage/). Apparently he thinks each state legislature should be able to outlaw my marriage.  It's come down to that, apparently, in the red states: _official_ racism.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-29-authoritarian-cops-boing-1.jpg" width="400" height="213" alt="Beschizza @ BoingBoing: Cops destroying security cameras" title="Beschizza @ BoingBoing: Cops destroying security cameras" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- In Georgia, another red state, cops were attempting to serve an arrest warrant on a young
  man.  However, they first physically _ripped down his parents security camera,_ throwing it
  into the bushes so they would not be recorded.  <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>

  Unfortunately for them, they were caught on the _other_ security camera.  They were also
  recorded uttering "vile and disgusting" racial slurs, showing a level of racist anger
  sufficient to motivate cops to destroy evidence.  
  
  Think it through: they hate being recorded by body cameras, but they also hate _your_
  cameras and are willing to destroy them.  They engage in destruction of evidence while
  spouting absolutely vile racial epithets against you.  
  
  They want power, absolutely beyond review or responsibility.  Fascists feel they have a
  _right_ to power, and that it should be a crime to limit them in any way.  

- In Arkansas last week there was a typical cop beating, notable chiefly in that it was
  recorded by bystanders unbeknownst to the cops administering the beating _to a handcuffed
  prisoner_.  It first hit in social media, where it kept getting taken down, and "real"
  news outlets ignored it.  

  Here's one person re-Tweeting it, to preserve the evidence (__NB:__ disturbing video of
  3 cops holding down a handcuffed prisoner, beating his head against concrete):  

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
      This just went down in Mulberry, AR, unfortunately, due to DMCA rules i had to mute
      the video (metallic was playing in the background) the people filming screamed at the
      cops towards the end they pretty much told them to shut up. will link the OP in the
      next tweet.

 <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

  Note at the end of the video how quickly the "subject stopped resisting" once the cops
  figured out they were on video.  

  Initially, the cops who beat this man so severely for "resisting arrest"
  (while handcuffed) were put on paid suspension/vacation during an "internal investigation"
  by their buddies.  Fortunately, the story eventually broke into the media where it
  received overwhelmingly negative coverage:  
  - The NPR coverage <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> noted that after the video "went
    viral" and could no longer be suppressed, there was finally political notice from the
    governor.  The beating was severe: one officer holding down the handcuffed prisoner,
    another kicking his lower body, and a third slamming his head against concrete.  NPR
    did note that the video was repeatedly taken down, but kept getting put back up by
    insistent members of the public.  
  - The _WaPo_ covers much of the same material using an _AP_ report. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  
  <iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LS1BLpgJzM4" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
  - The _PBS News Hour_ <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> went a bit deeper.  They consulted
    Alex Vitale, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College &amp; the CUNY Graduate
    Center, where he coordinates the Policing and Social Justice project, and is the
    author of _The End of Policing_.  
	- He points out that American police kill about 3 people every day in the US.  
	- Also, he says police departments have "consistently refused" to report body camera
      data in a way that would allow analysis of excessive use of force over time.  
    - But sadly, for the worst sort of officers, the fact that they're being recorded 
  	  "doesn't seem to make any difference" either in their excessive use of force or in
  	  resulting prosecutions (presumably due to qualified immunity).  
	- There are 18,000 or so police departments across the US, each with different
      standards for use of force (or no standards at all).  Hoping for a consistent policy
      is impossible as long as those are all under separate local control.  
	- Vitale favors reducing the use of police in many situations, in favor of public
      safety infrastructures to handle things like mental illness and drug addiction.
      Apparently, between 25% and 50% of people killed by police are in the middle of a
      mental health crisis.  Denver seems to be leading in this regard.  

  There are numerous other reports; I've only selected a few here.  The miracle is that
  the video made it out despite attempts to suppress it.  The opposite of a miracle is
  that _this will never stop_ so long as police have qualified immunity and think of
  themselves as an occupying army.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-29-authoritarian-cops-globe-1.jpg" width="400" height="198" alt="Myrick @ Globe: Tranform police by weeding out authoritarians" title="Myrick @ Globe: Tranform police by weeding out authoritarians" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- The venerable _Boston Globe_ reports a proposal, by the former mayor of Ithaca, to use a
  test for authoritarianism on candidates who apply for police
  jobs.  <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>  
  
  Some of this is perhaps due to the mayor's selection of a commissioner who, as a former
  Boston cop, suffered a near-fatal beating at the hands of other Boston cops.
  He's&hellip; unlikely to just take the cops' word for whether they're authoritarian or
  not, and wants a chance to take on "a culture of police violence and corruption that is
  so entrenched it may prove once again to be intractable" without new tools.  
  
  They are considering robust pre-employment psychological screenings, including polygraph
  tests.  This would require a change to the law on polygraph tests.  Polygraphs are
  generally regarded as BS, though _not by police_.  
  
  When used in a test for authoritarianism, it would seek to screen out certain types
  (__emphasis__ added):  

  >  The test is for psychological characteristics with a focus on __authoritarian
  >  tendencies__, because we believe these, even more than other problematic factors such
  >  as racism or implicit bias, are both easier to detect and __ultimately the most
  >  predictive of violent behavior down the road__.  
  >  
  > Authoritarian individuals are those who feel they must be obeyed. They are bullies who
  > demand subordination from others and display aggressive, impulsive traits. When we
  > administered our combined polygraph and psychological screening, we found a sharp
  > contrast between these unsuitable applicants’ statements in their earlier job
  > interviews and their answers during the final screening process.  
  >  
  > We had applicants who told us they wanted to be police officers because an uncle was a
  > cop, or because they wanted to serve the community, who later confessed the real
  > reason was their love of guns. We had applicants who told us during the polygraph that
  > they were bullied as kids, wanted the respect they were denied elsewhere, or needed to
  > teach “those people” who disrespected them a lesson. Frighteningly, the phrase “those
  > people” was one that arose again and again. Sometimes applicants admitted to a history
  > of violence. The results were sobering, to say the least.  
  >  
  > Once we added this step to our application process five years ago, it helped us
  > __eliminate a full 75 percent of applicants__ we otherwise would have hired. We were
  > disturbed when we saw many of those applicants hired in other departments.  

  They also found in Ithaca that police unions don't object to pre-employment tests of
  this nature the way they would to post-employment tests, because:  

  > There just aren’t many good arguments against a publicly stated goal of preventing
  > bullies and sadists from putting on the uniform.  
  
  Amen to that.  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pETDdCIWGQc" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
- Finally, consider Lawrence O'Donnell of _MSNBC_ interviewing _NYT_ columnist Charles 
  Blow on _The Last Word_.  <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>  

  Propaganda and disinformation are big deals.  But as long as people vote for
  authoritarian politicians, we will have fascist problems.  _People who vote for
  authoritarians and fascists are the problem!_  
  
  Blow points out that "conservatism in this country has _always_ been against democracy":  
  - We never even began to approach democracy until 1870 when a constitutional amendment
    gave Blacks the vote (at least for men); the immediate response of the
    conservative/fascist South was to suppress that with Jim Crow.  
  - Women couldn't vote until the 1920s.  
  - Jim Crow wasn't dismantled until the 1960s with the Voting Rights Act.  The response
    of the newly &uuml;ber-conservative modern Supreme Court has been to gut the Voting
    Rights Act.  
  - Not to mention: the unrepresentative nature of the Senate which gives disproportionate
    power to rural red states of low population.  
  - Also not to mention:  the now-insane levels of red-state gerrymandering to
    disenfranchise the majority and ensure white minority rule of Republicans.  
  - They apparently now do not even plan to try to win the most votes for president, but
    instead to install secretaries of state in each state who will simply overturn votes,
    or hand them off to the legislatures to overturn.  
  
  Hence the unapologetic claims from Republicans that the US is a republic, but _not_ a
  democracy!  


## The Weekend Conclusion  
 
So, yeah: we got _big_ problems with [right-wing authoritarians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_authoritarian_personality) having taken over the Republican party.  

Now, if it's just me saying things like that, you're entitled to dismiss it as the view of an
angry old man.  (Which it is.  But that is not incompatible with also being _correct._)

When many people say things like that, you can dismiss it as just some political movement.
(Like, say, everyone who's anti-fascist.)  

But when people whose _profession_ is to determine threats against American democracy say
things like that&hellip; then it may be time to start paying attention:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    I agree. And I was the CIA Director <a href="https://t.co/LRAHDDyy4n">https://t.co/LRAHDDyy4n</a>

</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

Now, look: I have little sympathy for the US Central Intelligence Agency or for those who
rise high in its ranks.  They tend to hit the Machiavelli and Nietzsche way too hard,
while tending to the authoritarian personality disorder themselves.  

But when _even they_ recognize Republicans as the biggest domestic terrorism threat to the
United States, it's time: never vote Republican ever again.  Not for any imaginable
political office, not for any conceivable reason.  

An elegant summary, found on Twitter via RWK:

Well, I wrote a pretty angry little jeremiad there, didn't I?  Still&hellip; it sums up how I feel about this political moment.  

This morning I found an interview on _MSNBC_ with Representative David Cicilline (D-RI) on
_Morning Joe_.  <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup> He's written a book called _House on
Fire_ <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup> calling out the dangers Republicans are posing
to US democracy through their authoritarianism and fascism.  And yes, he uses those exact
words when speaking of Republicans.  

Spot on.
