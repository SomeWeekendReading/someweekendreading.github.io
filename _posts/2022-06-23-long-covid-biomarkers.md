Crazy people are suspicious that Long COVID-19 is a real thing.  So we're gratified here
at Chez Weekend to find papers documenting what look like good biomarkers for it.  

## Long COVID skeptics  

There's a certain kind of cruel conservative viewpoint encouraging suspicion that the
suffering of "those people" is not real, or at least not as serious as claimed.  This
particularly applies to conditions affecting non-whites (e.g., sickle cell anemia) or
women (e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome).  Since they view COVID-19 as a preoccupation of
the liberal, they are also suspicious that Long COVID (now called "post-acute sequelae of
COVID-19", or PASC) is just "malingering."

Well, no more: 2 recent papers (one is a
preprint) <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
have found some interesting biomarkers in patients with PASC that are causally related to
the disease.  In short, viral protein fragments are circulating in their blood and
contained in monocytes, indicating a hidden reservoir of virus somewhere.  

In short, they're very provably still sick; this is a real condition we need to take very
seriously, since it seems to affect about 30% of COVID-19 patients according to the
Patterson paper!  

The Patterson paper was a study of 144 patients = 29 normal + 26 mild/moderate COVID-19 +
24 severe COVID-19 and 64 with Long COVID/PASC.  By comparing these groups, they established:  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-23-long-covid-biomarkers-front-immunol-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-23-long-covid-biomarkers-front-immunol-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="179" alt="Patterson, et al. @ Front Immunol: Persistent elevation of some monocytes in Long COVID" title="Patterson, et al. @ Front Immunol: Persistent elevation of some monocytes in Long COVID" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Some populations of __monocytes (intermediate CD14+/CD16+ and non-classical CD14lo/CD16+)
  were elevated in PASC up to 15 months__ after the initial infection compared to healthy
  controls ($p \lt 0.002$ and $p \lt 0.01$ by Kruskal-Wallis test).  That's what shown in
  Fig 1 of the paper, reproduced here:
  - The black circles are the normals, the red squares are the severe COVID-19 patients,
    and the blue triangles are the Long COVID patients.  
  - We see that in both CD14+/CD16+ and CD14lo/CD16+ monocytes, there is an elevation with
    respect to normals.  
  - While it looks like there's a trend of elevation between severe and Long COVID, it's
    not statistically significant.  
  - Note that the classical monocytes, in the first column, express ACE2 while the other
    types of monocytes pretty much do not.  So SARS-CoV2 can attack the classical
    monocytes harder, but the others can survive for a long time potentially preserving
    some viral proteins from the infection.  
- And that's the second finding: the non-classical __monocytes (CD14lo/CD16+) had measurable
  amounts of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV2 spike protein,__ confirmed by mass
  spectrometry.  
  - This might mean there are hidden virus caches in those patients, persistently
    re-infecting them at a low level.  
  - However, viral mRNA was _not_ found, indicating that maybe their immune system was
    holding on to the viral proteins and keeping up inflammation long past the infection.  
  - Either way, their reported symptoms look quite real, at the molecular level.  

Whatever's going on, the Long COVID-19 patients had perturbed immune systems and
measurable amounts of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein running
around in their bodies.  

The Swank paper looked in different places, but found a strikingly similar result.  They
looked in blood plasma of 63 COVID-19 and PASC patients.  They found persistent
circulating levels of SARS-CoV2 spike protein in the blood plasma for up to 12 months
post-infection in the majority of PASC patients.  They favor the hypothesis of a hidden
reservoir of virus in PASC patients.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-23-long-covid-biomarkers-medrxiv-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-06-23-long-covid-biomarkers-medrxiv-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="179" alt="Swank, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: Levels of S1, full spike, and nucleocapsid protein in normal and PASC plasma" title="Swank, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: Levels of S1, full spike, and nucleocapsid protein in normal and PASC plasma" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
That's what's shown in their Figure 1, reproduced here:  
- (A) is just the S1 subunit of the spike protein, (B) is the full spike protein, and (C)
  is the nucleocapsid protein (from _inside_ the viral envelope).  
- The blue dots are COVID-19 patients who did _not_ exhibit PASC, while the red dots
  are PASC patients.  
- The __full spike protein keeps popping, up well above the assay limit of detection,__ in the
  PASC patients.
- Note that they do _not_ see circulating S1 subunit or nucleocapsid in the plasma, but
  _do_ see the full spike protein.  This is perhaps a better reason to support the
  hypothesis of a viral reservoir, since it's got a full spike protein and not just the S1
  subunit?  

So there are a few differences between the papers:  
- Patterson found differences in monocyte populations, which Swank did not measure.  
- Swank found viral proteins circulating in blood plasma, which Patterson did not measure.  
- Patterson found just the S1 subunit (the RBD of the spike protein) inside monocytes,
  whereas Swank found the full spike circulating in blood plasma.  

The details are not fully consistent at this point, but the general point is clear: long
COVID-19 is a real thing, and the people who have it are still sick (viral proteins or
subdomains of them are still around, and monocyte populations in their immune systems are
still distinct from healthy patients).  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Long COVID-19 is real.  It happens up to 30% of the time, so it's also frequent enough
that it's a problem.  We need to find serious treatment for it!
