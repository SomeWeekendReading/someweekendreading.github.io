Today the Russian deaths in Ukraine passed another milestone: 800,000 dead.  


## It Just Doesn't End?  

While I find it difficult to sympathize with Russian leaders, the soldiers are another
matter.  As we've written previously <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
<sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
<sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup> <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>
<sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>, the casualties
just seem unending and Russian solders deserve some sympathy.  

Not _quite_ as much sympathy as the Ukrainians deserve, of course.  But clearly the
Russian leadership is deeply evil here.

Today it appears we have passed the milestone of 800,000 dead on the Russian side,
according to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence.  (Before you tell me that's Ukrainian
propaganda, have a look through the references for what I've written about this before.
The Ukrainian MoD seems to be pretty middle-of-the-pack on Russian casualties.)  

The previous milestone was 700,000 on 2024-Nov-04.  That was just about 2 months ago, so
Russian casualties are currently running at 50,000 dead _per month._  

It's hard to imagine ever greater
[devotion to Moloch]({{ site.baseurl }}/ukraine-700k/#the-weekend-conclusion).
They've _already_ sacrificed about 3-4% of their male population of military age, as we
calculated last November at the 700,000 milestone.  


## Comparison Against the Casualty Rate Model  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-01-08-ukraine-800k-regress-DayNum800k-on-Soldiers.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-01-08-ukraine-800k-regress-DayNum800k-on-Soldiers-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Russian casualties in Ukrain vs time; regression model trained on first 100ish days of war, more recent casualties in red" title="Russian casualties in Ukrain vs time; regression model trained on first 100ish days of war, more recent casualties in red" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Let's check in with
[the regression model of Russian casualties that we built on the first 116 days of the war]({{ site.baseurl }}/russian-casualty-data-update3/).  
- Shown here is the plot of casualties (vertical axis) versus time in days since start of
  the war (horizontal axis).  
- In the lower left you see the first 116 days of casualties, up to 200,000 dead in blue points.  
- The regression fit is the dashed line, while the 95% confidence limits and prediction
  limits are shown in gray bands around it.  (If you don't quite grasp what those mean, the
  practical import is that the regression model is very good and provides relatively tight
  predictions.)  
- In the upper right you see in red dots the more recent data (450k, 500k, 600k, 700k, and 800k dead)
  plotted against the model trained on the data with less than 200k dead.
  - The practical import of _that_ is we can compare casualty rates now versus those at
    the beginning of the war.
  - The red dots are:  
    - Above the trend line,   
	- Statistically significantly above it (outside the gray bands), and  
	- Appear to be accelerating.  

__Conclusion:__ Russians are dying faster now, compared to the beginning of the war.  


## Pigs.  It's Always the Pigs.  

Whenever you see some horrible event like this, it's always fruitful to ask _why this is happening_.  

It could be that Russia is using human-wave tactics with soldiers of little to no training,
resulting in mass casualties.  Or it could be the Ukrainians are getting more clever and
efficient at killing off the invaders.  

Which is it?  

Here's some evidence for the latter, i.e., the efficiency of the Ukrainians:  

<a href="https://mastodon.social/@KraftTea/113793328674766476"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-01-08-ukraine-800k-ukr-pigs.jpg" width="800" height="801" alt="Ukrainian pigs have learned to follow drones, and eat abandoned Russian bodies" title="Ukrainian pigs have learned to follow drones, and eat abandoned Russian bodies" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

- It appears that the Russian killed in action to wounded in action (KIA/WIA) ratio is now
  worse than the World War I levels.  
- Russia apparently leaves behind their wounded, due to a lack of APCs, medical evacuation
  capability, lack of hospitals, soldiers going AWOL, expected deaths in human wave
  assaults, and so on.  
- There are enough bodies left behind to be a significant food source for local wildlife.
  In particular, a large number of formerly domesticated pigs are now regularly eating
  abandoned Russian bodies.  
  
In the lower right picture above, a pig is investigating a Ukrainian drone.  It appears
that the pigs have learned to follow aerial drones or to wait with drones in ground ambush
mode, because they know there will be Russian bodies soon.  

The pigs have learned.  

The Russian leaders have not.  It seems like Russian soldiers should learn to look out for
pigs, because that's a signal there might be a drone nearby.

I guess Ukrainian morale is high, at least as shown in
[this video reported last year by the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence](https://x.com/DefenceU/status/1705136284878921946)
(admittedly a source of likely bias).  

On the other hand, for the rest of us this is anything _but_ an occasion for merriment.  

The Russian casualty rates are reminiscent of the worship of
[Huītzilōpōchtli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu%C4%ABtzil%C5%8Dp%C5%8Dchtli) in the
ancient Tenocha Confederacy (approximately "Aztecs"), who required continuous mass
sacrifices.  

But that would be inaccurate: they sacrificed _other nation's peoples_ captured in war,
not their own people.  Russia is sacrificing its own people, now 3-4% of males of
military age, in pursuit of an hallucination of power.  

That's [Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/): sacrifice
your children to a red-hot metal idol, hoping he will grant you power.  

Pure Russian Moloch, all the way down.
