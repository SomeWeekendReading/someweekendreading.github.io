Today I got shot.  Again.  For the _sixth_ time this year!  


## What?  Again?!  

We've done this a couple of times now, right?  I struggled through getting [the first COVID-19 shot when they were hard to get]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot/), and then [the second shot which was hard to schedule but easy otherwise]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot-again/).  

I had hoped that would be enough.  If we had _all_ vaccinated (and by "all" I mean 
_all of humanity_), and done it _fast_, then it would have been enough.  But&hellip; no.
We did it slowly, dragging our feet at every opportunity.  We encouraged various
knotheaded reasons to hesitate, resist, and defy vaccination.  I am _so_ tired of having
to be the adult in the room who tolerates knotheads and has to explain gently, over and
over and _over_!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-17-fda-covid-boosters-israel-1.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="Israeli data: Delta is the only strain that matters, and it's nasty" title = "Israeli data: Delta is the only strain that matters, and it's nasty" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The result?  Delta.  

We bred an entirely new strain of SARS-CoV-2, which is just _viciously_ virulent,
outcompeting all other strains, and infecting the unvaccinated like mad.  The fact that
here at Chez Weekend, as vaccinated persons, we have to put up with increased exposure
risk due to unvaccinated knotheads just galls me.  Even more, it galls me that people are
dying from a preventable disease, because they are victims of right-wing disinformation.  

I was a bit mixed in my reactions to
[the last couple week's decisions from the FDA &amp; CDC]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-covid-boosters/)
simultaneously promoting and limiting boosters:
- On the one hand, it seems blunt-trauma-obvious that we're all better off getting the
  unvaccinated to be vaccinated, whether in the US or around the world.  
- On the other hand, I'd feel a lot safer with a personal booster even though I know a
  thing or two about [the Simpson's Paradox effect]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-simpson/)
  that is making it look like vaccine efficacy is fading more than it really is.  

Still&hellip; maybe I can just overcome these mild misgivings and take the booster.  


## The Vaccine Defiance Stupidity is Nakedly Partisan  

People have heads full of the most _bizarre_ misinformation and confusion.  For example:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    A patient in the ER just asked me for a booster shot.<br><br>Unfortunately she was
    very confused. Because her oxygen was low. Because she had severe Covid. Because she
    never had her first vaccine dose.<br><br>

    Our top priority must remain vaccinating those who haven’t yet gotten their shots.

It's important to realize that we're not _all_ like that.  It's very, very concentrated on
the right.  Republicans are doing this to themselves, and the media is helping them along
by treating them so gently and respectfully while they do stupid things.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-27-today-i-got-shot-a-sixth-time-pressrun.jpg" width="400" height="152" alt="Boehlert: Media ignore the right-wing zombies" title = "Boehlert: Media ignore the right-wing zombies" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As Eric Boehlert writes at _PressRun_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, the problem is
that we've been _way_ too gentle with the disinformation peddlers and even with their
victims.  We shouldn't use gentle terms like "hesitant" or "skeptical" any more to
describe them, but instead earthier, rougher, and more honest language.  It's not just
"disinformation", it's outright brainwashing and propaganda.  (Just as we should have
called Trump "liar", but didn't in the name of a decorum that was most certainly not
reciprocated.)  

Apparently Boehlert reads _Breitbart_ (to which I refuse even to link), so the rest of us
don't have to.  This is, in some measure, a public service, much like we all depend on the
vital work of those devoted souls who labor in sewers (no, really: I mean that &ndash;
they do difficult work from which we all benefit).  The latest right-wing sewage gushing forth
is that we're trying to murder them by encouraging them to
get vaccinated, knowing they'll dig in &amp; refuse, so that they'll die of COVID-19:

__Mind: boggled.__  

This isn't just opinion; it's _data_ and _evidence_.  As we've written before 
(e.g., [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-loves-republicans/), 
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/politics-vs-mask-and-vaccine-use/), and 
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccinations-vs-votes/)), the mischief is
concentrated in the US among Republicans.  And it's actual data that tells us this, with
both high statistical significance and effect size.  

Now there's evidence that the Republican right has not only stayed extreme in the face of
self-inflicted death, but doubled down.  

Consider California: the Republicans started a recall campaign against the Democratic
governor, essentially to keep re-adjuticating his election.  Compare the results with
COVID cases: if correlation were causation, you'd think COVID-19 caused recall votes.  (In
fact, the underlying variable causing both is of course Republicanism.)

David Leonhardt, writing in today's Morning Newsletter in the 
_New York Times_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, tells us the pattern is growing even
more extreme at the national level.  He repeats 
[the state-level analysis we did here before]({{ site.baseurl }}/politics-vs-mask-and-vaccine-use/),
and shows in the plot here that it's not only still there, the relationship of outright
defiance of vaccination is even more associated with Trumpiness.  Charles Gaba did this at the county level, [as we previously cited]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccinations-vs-votes/), and found the fine-grain data was just as extreme.

## Today I Got Boosted  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-27-today-i-got-shot-a-sixth-time-newyorker.jpg" width="400" height="241" alt="Gounder: Boosters won't solve the whole problem" title = "Gounder: Boosters won't solve the whole problem" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
But&hellip; but&hellip; as all the existentialists say, no matter what the world _should_
be, here we are with the world as it _is._  What's the correct course of action, given the
prior that the world is as we can best observe it to be at this moment?  

So today I got a booster.  Refusing a booster would be modeling incorrect behavior for the
vaccine defiant, and "my" dose wouldn't go to the unvaccinated anyway.  So I elected to
boost my own immunity.  

- The FDA recommended it 10 days ago, and the CDC approved it last Friday.  
- On Saturday, I looked at my local CVS's web site, and made an appointment for the
  following Monday, i.e., today.  No sense waiting, right?   

As Helen Rosner write in the _New Yorker_ interviewing epidemiologist C&eacute;line
Gounder <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, we can't expect boosters to solve the whole
pandemic problem for us.  She thinks the boosters make sense for the elderly and the
immune compromised, but not so much for everybody else.  

The antibody rush right after vaccination probably only lasts a few months and then
declines; this is normal for vaccines.  Your blood isn't full of antibodies to every virus
you've ever encountered in your life; you'd practically be made of nothing but antibodies
if that were the case!  Your memory B-cells remember how to make new antibodies when
confronted with the virus later.  So boosters may just be a temporary bump in antibodies
and nothing more, for immune competent people.  

Gounder says something we've been harping on here at this crummy little blog that nobody
reads: healthy, non-elderly people with 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine may be better served
not by getting a booster themselves, but by that shot getting in the arm of the
unvaccinated.  That applies domestically, and to the entire world.  

Her well-put caution is worth taking seriously:

But I'm in the booster-approved group of people over 65. So here's the now-regrettably-canonical picture of my portside dorsal manipulator tentacle getting a dose of Comirnaty a.k.a. tozinameran (otherwise better known as the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine).  No, I [do not love the names]({{ site.baseurl }}/moderna-vaccine-passes-vrbpac-review/#fn2).  But I do love the idea of _not getting COVID-19._  Or really, the idea of _nobody_ getting COVID-19!
  
Alas, we are too late for about 688,000 Americans and about 4.55 million worldwide:

So if &mdash; for some exceptionally obscure reason &mdash; you wish to do me a favor,
then go out and get vaccinated.  You can make an old man happy by telling me about in the
comments below (or not, as you please).  But really: get vaccinated.  Try not to die.  

Too many people have taken the other path already.  I just can't take it any more, watching
people die needlessly.  


## 2021: A Bannner Year For Vaccines Chez Weekend  

Look, it's been a _lot_ of vaccinations for us this year, here at Chez Weekend.  3
COVID-19 vaccinations + 2 shingles vaccinations + 1 flu vaccination = 6 vaccinations 
_in a single year._  The Weekend Editrix is pretty similar, at 5 so far this year.  

We haven't had that many vaccinations in a single year since we were a kids!  

And I'm thankful for each one.  Each time, I smiled at the tech giving me the shot and
said so, occasionally to their surprise.  

Still&hellip; I'm a _little_ tired of getting vaccinated so often.  If we'd _all_ get
adequately vaccinated, then this could stop.  Until then, I'll keep doing what's required
to keep all of us alive.  

If you need a COVID-19 or flu vaccination (or really _any_ vaccination), by all means get
it done.  For yourself, for your family, for your country, for humanity as a whole.  

Now&hellip; to carefully peruse
[the CDC list of qualifying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html)
to find an excuse to get the Weekend Editrix boosted next month!  I've got my eye on a
couple of the milder conditions.  (We were hoping to go to Japan in December to visit
family, all fully vaccinated.  Except last night United cancelled all our flights.  Still
arguing about refunds.  Grrr.)  

Tune in tomorrow for a field report on booster side effects.
