Today is the 42nd anniversary of the day on which Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov decided
_not_ to end the world.  Not ending the world is an example worthy of imitation, even by our
degenerate politicians.  As well as by each of us.  


## Not Yet the [Eschaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschatology)  

As we've commemorated before (in [2020]({{ site.baseurl }}/petrov-day/), in 
[2021]({{ site.baseurl }}/petrov-day-2021/), and in [2022]({{ site.baseurl }}/petrov-day-2022/))
on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), today is the too-little-celebrated
anniversary of the important day 1983-Sep-26 when the world _could_ have ended, but did
_not_.  That was because one man disobeyed orders, and did some critical thinking
instead.

It was particularly due to Russian
[Lt. Col. Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov)
(obituary from NPR at reference <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>),
who wisely decided that, all else being equal, he would prefer not to destroy the world.


On that night, he was the duty officer at the Soviet nuclear early-warning center at Oko.
Sunlight reflected off clouds had convinced a Soviet satellite watching a US missile base
that exactly, and only, 5 missiles had launched. Petrov, on his own authority, defied the
launch on warning standing orders and declared it a false alarm. Probably Petrov thought
something like, "One missile, I can understand &ndash; that’s an accident. One thousand
missiles, I can understand &ndash; that’s an attack. But five missiles? That I cannot
understand." Petrov stepped outside the box of obedience to standing orders, applied
critical thinking, and decided not to cooperate with the system that would have ended the
world.  

Petrov rebelled; humanity got to live.  It's an _excellent_ trade.  

Sometimes a hero does not need to be brave to show heroism.  Critical thinking and a
determination to _do the right thing_ in the face of institutional decay is
enough, surprisingly often.  Amid the rubble of our present-day institutional decay, we
should do likewise.  


Some of us like to think of 'Petrov Day' as a 
[not-yet-realized holiday](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/petrov-day) that deserves more celebration.   


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Pick your flavor of [tikkun ha’olam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam).  Whatever
it is, do something that does not end the world, but instead heals it and contributes to
the health of humanity.  

When you find yourself also embedded in an absurd, evil system&hellip; do not obey.
Especially do not obey in advance.  Do the _right_ thing instead.
