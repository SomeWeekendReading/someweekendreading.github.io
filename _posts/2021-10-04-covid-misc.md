Do you want the good news first?  


## The Good News  

Be not afraid: it's mostly good news.  _Mostly._  

### The FDA calendar  

First up, the FDA calendar is _full_ over the next 3 weeks.  They're meeting about boosters
for the other vaccines, mix-n-match booster combinations, and the first kiddo vax:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    NEW: The FDA&#39;s independent advisory committee has announced 3 upcoming meetings
    for vaccine discussions:<br>
    - October 14: Moderna booster<br>
    - October 15: J&amp;J booster<br>
    - October 15: Mix-and-match boosters<br>
    - October 26: Pfizer vaccine for kids 5-11

That's a lot, and we won't be putting in the huge effort to live-blog all of them 
[as we did previously for the Pfizer booster hearings]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-covid-boosters/).
But we'll try to hit the high points on the appropriate days.

I know people are really frustrated at the apparent glacial pace of all of this.  But
&ndash; trust me on this &ndash; they're really moving at breakneck speed, while ensuring
everything is safe.  The amount of compromise between all the gatekeepers needed is quite
time-consuming.  (You might argue we need fewer gate-keepers, but that would raise the risk
of life-ending medical scams in normal times.)  So this schedule looks really good to me!  

### Research on a pan-coronavirus vaccine

Second, from _Genetic Engineering &amp; Biotechnology News_ comes the 
report <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> that the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has awarded $36 million for the development of a
_pan-coronavirus vaccine!_  The grat announcment itself <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
summarizes the purpose thus:  

> NIAID is issuing this Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) to highlight the critical need
> to develop prophylactic vaccines able to provide broad and durable protection against
> coronaviruses (CoVs), especially SARS-CoV-2 and others with pandemic potential. NIAID is
> particularly interested in highly collaborative, multi-disciplinary Program Projects
> (P01s) that incorporate understanding of CoV virology and immunology, immunogen design,
> and innovative vaccine and adjuvant platforms and technologies to discover, design, and
> develop pan-coronavirus (pan-CoV) vaccine candidates that provide broad protective
> immunity to multiple CoV strains.

That's not just against the SARS-CoV2 variant _du jour_, or even all its variants, but
against all coronaviruses in general.  Because there are about a bajillion of them.  Ok,
actually there are something like 7 that currently infect 
humans. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>

Three are nasty: MERS, SARS, and SARS-CoV2. The other four cause mild respiratory diseases
that, if you had them, you'd think you had a cold.  But in nature&hellip; there are a
bajillion kinds of coronaviruses infecting various animals.  Given climate change, habitat
destruction, and human bone-headedness, there _will_ be more zoonotic transfers and
probably more pandemics.  Best nip that in the bud.  

The notice was issued back in 2021-Nov, when we were all busy looking for _any vaccine at
all_.  It's now been granted to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Brigham &amp;
Women's Hospital in Boston, and Duke University.  Good luck to all of them.  

So that's both short-term and long-term good news.  This whole panedemic has made me
reflect on how _lucky_ we've been to have just exactly the right technologies available:
high-throughput sequencing, molecular level assays, mRNA synthesis techniques, lipid
nanocapsules for delivery, and all the other stuff that came together at _exactly_ the
right moment.

Were it not for the fascists and the vaccine denialists intent on nihilism and burning,
one might ascribe that to divine inspiration.  Ok, maybe it _is_ divine inspiration, and
the bad parts are just us being us.  

### Mandates seem to work?  

Third, everybody's been saying mandates won't work, people will quit jobs rather than get
vaccinated, and so on.  The media has been fueling this with their usual mathematically
incompetent headlines.  Here's an example, with a correction helpfully supplied on
Twitter:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    &quot;Bridges was among about 150 employees who were fired or resigned rather than
    comply...About 25,000 other employees at the hospital system
    complied.&quot;<br><br>

    Alternative headline: &quot;99.4% of hospital workers vaccinated following
    mandate&quot;. But sure, a whole article on one of the 0.6% ðŸ™„ðŸ‘† 
  </p> 
  &mdash; Al (@albertjschulman) <a href="https://twitter.com/albertjschulman/status/1444831332685725702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2021</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

_Reuters_ wants to tell you all about the defiance of vaccines, telling irrelevant
personal stories in loving detail.  But the _real_ story is that 99.4% of the employees at
those hospitals decided to get vaccinated.  Concentrating on the remaining 0.6% is just a
waste of your time at best, and flagrantly deceptive at worst.  

There are many similar results, e.g., United Airlines is losing 0.4% of employees.  Or,
for example, the Swiss Guard:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    The media continues to report breathlessly on the small number of holdouts when the
	vast majority of people are getting vaccinated. As of 2019 the Swiss guard had 135
	members. So weâ€™re talking about like 98% compliance. Itâ€™s media malpractice to frame
	it this way. Mandates work. <a href="https://t.co/LQa7EsEqNt">https://t.co/LQa7EsEqNt</a>

  &mdash; Jean-Michel Connard î¨€ (@torriangray) <a href="https://twitter.com/torriangray/status/1445143572466962448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2021</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

Mandates work.  _That's_ the story.  

### Molnupiravir works  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-04-covid-misc-stat.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="Herper at STAT: Molnupiravir reduces COVID-19 hospitalizations" title = "Herper at STAT: Molnupiravir reduces COVID-19 hospitalizations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Fourth, from Matthew Herper at _STAT News_ comes the usual good, solid stuff: this time a report on
molnupiravir, an orally available COVID-19 therapy from Merck.<sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
This drug candidate works by disrupting some of the genetic proofreading mechanisms in the
virus, so that errors accumulate each time it divides and eventually is non-viable.  In
that respect, it's like remdesivir; though unlike remdesivir it's just a pill, not an
infusion.  

It has to be given early in the course of the disease, ideally before symptoms.  That
points to the need for a _lot_ more testing of asymptomatic people, if this is going to do any good.
Not to mention the logistics of pre-positioning the drug at every hospital in the world,
so people who test positive can start on it immediately.  And figure out how to pay the
$700 each course of the drug will cost.  (Have you considered that vaccines are both
cheaper and _already_ pre-positioned everywhere we can reach so far?)  

The clinical trial showed 14.1% of the placebo patients were hospitalized or died, while
7.3% of the molnupiravir patients did so.  While _STAT News_ won't calculate the efficacy
from that, here at Chez Weekend we have no such inhibitions:  

$$
\begin{align*}
\mbox{Efficacy} &= 100.0 \% \times \left(1 - \frac{p_\mbox{treatment}}{p_\mbox{placebo}}\right) \\
                &= 100.0 \% \times \left(1 - \frac{0.073}{0.141}\right) \\
                &=  48.2 \%
\end{align*}
$$

We can get a 95% confidence interval pretty easily here, too.  That's because the
reporters at _STAT News_ are _not_ of the mathematically illiterate sort, and they give us
enough information to calculate how many patients were in each arm:  
- 53 placebo cases were 14.1%, so there were 53/0.141 = 376 placebo subjects  
- 28 treatment cases were 7.3%, so there were 28/0.073 = 384 treatment subjects  

```R
> library("gsDesign") # For ciBinomial()
> mnpData <- matrix(c(53, 28, round(53/0.141), round(28/0.073)), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = FALSE,
                    dimnames = list(c("Placebo", "Treatment"), c("Ncases", "Ntotal"))); mnpData
          Ncases Ntotal
Placebo       53    376
Treatment     28    384

> ## Now calculate the efficacy, as above
> pPlacebo   <- mnpData["Placebo",   "Ncases"] / mnpData["Placebo",   "Ntotal"]
> pTreatment <- mnpData["Treatment", "Ncases"] / mnpData["Treatment", "Ntotal"]
> efficacy   <- round(100.0 * (1 - pTreatment / pPlacebo), digits = 2)

> ## Frequentist method: risk rates are scaled binomial, so we use the binomial
> ## confidence interval function in the gsDesign package.
> ci <- round(100.0 * (1 - rev(ciBinomial(mnpData["Treatment", "Ncases"],
                                          mnpData["Placebo",   "Ncases"],
                                          mnpData["Treatment", "Ntotal"],
                                          mnpData["Placebo",   "Ntotal"],
                                          scale = "RR"))),
              digits = 2)

> c(EfficacyLCL = ci[[1]], Efficacy = efficacy, EfficacyUCL = ci[[2]])
EfficacyLCL    Efficacy EfficacyUCL 
      20.45       48.27       66.47 
> 
```

Conclusions:  
- Molnupiravir has an estimated efficacy against hospitalization &amp; death of 48.2%.  
- We're 95% confident the true efficacy is between 20.45% &ndash; 66.47%.  
- Small study size ($N$ = 760) makes the 95% CI disappointingly wide.  

We're pretty sure it does _something_, i.e., it's bounded away from 0.  It's _likely_ that
it reduces the risk of hospitalization &amp; death by around half.  

So&hellip; yeah, it's nothing like the 90%+ efficacy of a vaccine that _prevents you from
getting sick in the first place_, but it's still good to reduce the risk of hospitalization
and death by about half for those who do get sick.  

And, of course, it's not yet approved.  That's a whole 'nother story, and more FDA
hearings.  

### Retraction: myocarditis is 1 in 25,000 &mdash; not 1 in 1,000!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-04-covid-misc-reuters-fact-check.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="Reuters fact check: retraction myocarditis study, real risk is 1 in 25,000" title = "Reuters fact check: retraction myocarditis study, real risk is 1 in 25,000" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Fifth, there was a nasty preprint a few weeks back claiming that the incidence of
myocarditis from the mRNA vaccine was a shockingly high 1 in 1000.  This was instantly
picked up on social media, and fueled the anti-vax firestorms in the usual venues.  A lot
of the conservative sites like _Gateway Pundit_ particuarly hyped it (no, I will _not_
link to the sewer).  

Today from the fact checkers at _Reuters_ comes a happy little notice that the study has
been retracted. <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  

I won't link to the retracted study because it looks like responsible people just made a
mistake (_Reuters_ does link, if you're curious).  But it was _quite_ a blunder: they used
the wrong denominator: there were 845,930 people vaccinated in their target population
instead of just 32,379!  

That lowers the rate of myocarditis by a factor of 25, taking the risk from an alarming 1
in 1000 to about 1 in 25,000.  Something to be prepared for with mass vaccinations, but hardly
the threat initially claimed.

The researchers were straightforwardly honest about the mistake, which speaks well of
them and makes me want to treat them very gently and respectfully:  

> Our reported incidence appeared vastly inflated by an incorrectly small denominator (ie
> number of doses administered over the time period of the study). We reviewed the data
> available &hellip; and found that there had indeed been a major underestimation,
> with the actual number of administered doses being more than 800,000 (much higher than
> quoted in the paper).

This is why you should have a statistician check your work: figure out the correct base rate!  

So&hellip; the risk of myocarditis is still low.  The mRNA vaccines are still very, very
safe.  


## &hellip;Aaaand the Rest  

You just _know_ when somebody says "first, the good news"&hellip; that some bad news is
coming.  Well, here we are.  

### The hospital situation grows worse  

The Delta wave is causing problems everywhere, but especially in low-vaccination areas.
Those hospitals are seeing a _huge_ surge in unvaccinated patients, some making too-late
requests for the vaccine, as they lay dying.  These hospitals have had to institute what's
called "crisis standards of care", i.e., forcing doctors to allocate resources to those
most likely to live, and letting the rest die.  This used to be called _triage_ in the
military, because you divide casualties into 3 groups: those who will die no matter what
you do, those who can wait a bit, and those who will die unless you care for them _now_.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-04-covid-misc-nyt-1.jpg" width="400" height="243" alt="NYT: Triage in Alaska hospitals" title = "NYT: Triage in Alaska hospitals" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-04-covid-misc-nyt-2.jpg" width="400" height="221" alt="NYT: Surge in Alaska is worse than even the American South" title = "NYT: Surge in Alaska is worse than even the American South" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
From the _Times_ comes an article by Mike Baker, giving us stories of the trials of
providing healthcare in Alaska. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  

I'm slightly frustrated with this article, for the usual reasons: it concentrates on
telling "human interest" stories of individuals, while not putting together the Big
Picture that tells you what it all means.  On the other hand, it' _does_ point to the
heartbreaking consequences of our collective stupidity: people dying in hospital, and
doctors being threatened by knuckleheads.  

But when you look at the case rate in Alaska versus other regions of the US, it's clear
that right now it's worse even than the American South!  Testing supplies are exhausted,
patients dying in hallways, doctors rationing oxygen! Sitting on the floor to suture up
wounds, because there aren't even enough stretchers!  This is _not_ the rational response of
an advanced nation.  

It's important to appreciate the _price_ of our stupidity in a public health crisis, and
have that rubbed into our faces so we won't do it again.  

I don't have much hope we'll learn that.  

What's especially disappointing is the right-wing mobs who threaten violence against
doctors who testified at the Alaska legislature's hearings on masks.  They of course
screamed about using ivermectin, the de-worming med that's an _id&eacute;e fixe_ delusion
in their tribe.  The doctors were told they had "sold out and are liars", for reasons that
are dramatically unclear.  Another was arrested for disorderly conduct and _carrying a
concealed weapon._  Some wore the Star of David, in an attempt to compare themselves to
the victims of Nazi torture and genocide!  Now, I've _met_ holocaust survivors, and this
is _something a civilized person does not do._  

And organized intimidation campaigns sometimes work: several doctors were afraid to go
testify, and others required private security guards.  

Think about that: doctors afraid for their safety from a mob, when there's a pandemic on
and those doctors are the only ones who can save lives.  This is _deeply stupid._ Not to
mention demonically vicious.  I would almost propose demonic possession as a potential
diagnosis of the American Republicans, if that were a thing that happened in the real
world.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-04-covid-misc-apnews.jpg" width="400" height="194" alt="AP News: Surge in New England, despite high vax rates" title = "AP News: Surge in New England, despite high vax rates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Now, you might think that I'm saying all this somewhat hautily from the fastness of
Chateau Weekend, safely ensconced here in New England amongst the most highly vaccinated
Americans.  And you'd be partly right, I admit.  But&hellip; there's a wave here too,
filling up our ICUs badly enough that _AP News_ had to report it. <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>

Yes, we're pretty highly vaccinated here: the low is 61.5% in New Hampshire, up to 69.4%
in Vermont.  I mean, hey: we're not _stupid_, we want to live through this!  

But even so, we have the same problems as everywhere else, just somewhat muted:
- Vaccination isn't uniform: our rural areas are less vaccinated like everywhere else,
  and that's a feeding ground for Delta COVID and the breeding of even newer variants.  
- Also, given the ever-rising $R\_0$ estimates for Delta, it now seems herd immunity is at
  about 90% immunity.  If we can get to 70% vaccination and 20% "natural" immunity from
  survivors of infection, that might do it.  But it would be better just to have
  _everybody_ get vacinated: this won't go away until we do, or else everybdoy who
  resists will be dead or infection-recovered.  

### Koch money funds and organizes borderline domestic terrorism  

A lot of the vaccine resistance, mask resistance, and general resistance to rationality of
any form seems repetitive.  The people who show up are generally less educated.  They tend
to scream a lot.  They threaten violence.  They yell the same inanities about ivermectin,
vaccine infertility, that Fauci somehow invented the SARS-CoV2 virus for some reason, that
doctors are all lying, and so on.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-04-covid-misc-beziers.jpg" width="400" height="298" alt="Beziers Cathedral: built on site of a Cathar massacre" title = "Beziers Cathedral: built on site of a Cathar massacre" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Often their arguments are about religious freedom, but for religion of the worst sort:
they effectively demand as much human sacrifice as a worshipper of
[Huitzilopochtli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu%C4%ABtzil%C5%8Dp%C5%8Dchtli).  

They remind me of this photograph I found just today, from
[Chris Bertram at _Crooked Timber_](https://crookedtimber.org/2021/10/04/monday-photoblogging-beziers-cathedral/).
the Cath&eacute;drale Saint-Nazaire-et-Saint-Celse de B&eacute;ziers is indeed a beautiful building, and
symbolic of much that is good in humanity.  But it is founded on a vicious premise: in
1209, the [Albigensian Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albigensian_Crusade)
against the [apparently harmless Cathars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharism)
murdered over 20,000.  The commander of the French forces,
[Simon de Montfort, 5th Earl of Leicester, seigneur de Monfort-l'Amaury, Viscount of Albi, B&eacute;ziers and Carcassonne, and Comte de Toulouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_de_Montfort,_5th_Earl_of_Leicester),
is supposed to have been not too picky about who was or was not a Cathar, when he ordered:
["Caedite eos! Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius." (Kill them all! G-d will know his own.)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caedite_eos._Novit_enim_Dominus_qui_sunt_eius.)
Then the B&eacute;ziers Cathedral was later built upon the ruins of the previous Cathar structure.  

The best religion heals and cares for _everyone_, not just those who agree with us.  The
anti-vaxxers, the Albigensian crusaders, and the disciples of Huitzilopochtli
are not practicing the best religion.  

When the authoritarians get organized and use religion as a tool, they become dangerous.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-04-covid-misc-wapo-1.jpg" width="400" height="130" alt="WaPo: Koch money backs violent threats against school boards for mask mandates" title = "WaPo: Koch money backs violent threats against school boards for mask mandates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-04-covid-misc-wapo-2.jpg" width="400" height="310" alt="WaPo: Koch-funded protesters threatening Las Vegas school boards" title = "WaPo: Koch-funded protesters threatening Las Vegas school boards" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

And so it is today: from the _WaPo_ comes news that the groups intimidating, for example,
school boards, are in fact organized and funded by
[Koch family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_family) money. <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>
_Rolling Stone_ has an article with similar 
evidence <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup> <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>, 
possibly even more damning.  

Apparently they particularly hate any effort to ameliorate climate change or to have a
social safety net at all.  Better to burn coal, and make people work cheaper because
they're afraid of dying, or so it seems from their actions.  It's a scandal that the
Supreme Court decisions in recent years around dark money in politics allow this to be
funded more or less in secret.

Here's a thought: should it come to pass that you find yourself in a secret combination,
taking money and talking points from the billionaires who best typify psychology's 
[dark triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad), 
with demonic levels of narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychpathy&hellip; it's time to
re-think your life choices.  

What's the word we have for deliberate, organized intimidation for political purposes?
Oh, that's right: domestic terrorism.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Times are bad.  Mostly because we insist on _making_ them bad, with self-inflicted wounds
from the right wing.  And 
[self-inflicted wounds are the slowest to heal]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#your-humble-weekend-editor).  

But times are also good: we have _exactly_ the tools we need to fight the pandemic with
amazing vaccines and increasingly good therapeutics; we're _trying_ to be equitable about
it; and we're looking to the future with pan-coronavirus vaccines to stop the next
pandemic before it starts.  

I prefer the latter.  You should too: we have the tools of science to be kind to one
another, if only we could muster the will to be so.
