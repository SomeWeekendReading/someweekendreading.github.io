How long can COVID-19 go on?  If you answered less than $O(10^4)$ years until everyone
with susceptible genes is dead&hellip; well, think again.  


## How long can a pandemic go on, really?  

We are now starting our 3rd year of a global pandemic.  Everybody's tired of it.
Everybody wants it to end so we can move on.  How much longer, really, can that take?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-06-really-long-covid-currbiol-1.jpg" width="400" height="152" alt="Curr Biol: Human genetics and 20,000 year old coronavirus epidemic in Asia" title="Curr Biol: Human genetics and 20,000 year old coronavirus epidemic in Asia" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
It's just come to my attention that last summer there was a pretty disturbing paper in
_Current Biology_ by Souilmi, _et al._ on an ancient pandemic, also very likely a
coronavirus. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  We'll go through it in some detail below, paying
attention to their methods, but the conclusion is stark: around 20,000 to 25,000 years ago
in East Asia, there was a coronavirus epidemic that lasted long enough to leave a genetic
imprint on the human population: a bit over 700 generations, or _around 20,000 years._  It
stopped when all those with susceptible genes were _dead._  

Maybe we should try to avoid that?

If you don't want to read a full-up scientific paper, or for that matter my summary of it,
you can look through popular media summaries.  You probably know that here at Chez Weekend
we take a dour view of the popular media's attempt report science; it's usually mangled
beyond all recognition.  

However, we've found 4 articles which, after reading the actual paper, seem not to have
mangled anything too badly (though they all do leave out _a lot!_).  
- Carl Zimmer at the _New York Times_ is a pretty good science journalist, and it shows in
  the work he did reporting on this last June in his column.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  
- Theresa Machemer at the _Smithsonian Magazine_ did a similarly credible 
  job <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> around the same time.  She also extracts the tidbit
  that the epidemic of coronavirus infection in East Asia _went on for 20,000 years,_ which
  should get you to notice that just "muddling through" is the incorrect response here.
- The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)'s science reporters Conroy and Salleh also
  summarized things relatively clearly. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  
- Yasemin Saplakoglu at LiveScience wrote an even briefer, though relatively accurate
  summary all the way back in April <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, so she gets pride of
  place for doing the early reporting when the paper was still a preprint.  


## Some history  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-06-really-long-covid-worldometer-cases-deaths.jpg" width="400" height="594" alt="WorldOMeter: COVID-19 daily cases & deaths as of 2021-Jan-06" title="WorldOMeter: COVID-19 daily cases & deaths as of 2021-Jan-06" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
There are 7 coronaviruses that regularly infect humans.  
- Of those, 4 are _relatively_ recent and cause something like a cold: HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43,
  HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>.  
  - Together, they account for about 15% - 30% of common colds in upper adults, while
    rarely causing life-threatening lower respiratory infections in infants, the elderly,
    and the immunocompromised.  
  - Based on known rates of mutation, they are relatively new in evolutionary terms. The
    newest, HCoV-HKU1, emerged in about the 1950s. The oldest, HCoV-NL63, looks like it
    emerged about 1200CE, or 820 years ago.  
- The remaining 3 are all _very_ recent and all _big_ troublemakers, each a result of zo&ouml;notic
  transfer (from bats, civets, and camels, apparently):  
  - SARS-COV1 emerged in China in 2002, infecting 8000 and kiling 800 before subsiding (a
    10% lethality rate).  
  - MERS-CoV emerged in 2006 in the Middle East, infecting 2400 and killing over 850
    before subsiding (a 35% lethality rate!).  
  - Finally, SARS-CoV2 emerged in 2019 in China (again!), triggering the pandemic in which
    we find ourselves: as of 2021-Jan-06 there have been 298,549,912 cases and 5,484,607
    deaths worldwide (a 1.8% lethality rate). <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  
    
Worse, there is now profound evidence that SARS-CoV2 has infected many wild, farmed, and
domesticated animals, so it can come back by _another_ zo&ouml;notic transfer at any 
time. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  

This naturally and pointedly raises the question: _how much longer can this go on?_  

## A look back in deep time

In the paper we're doing today in Weekend Journal Club, Souilmi and co-authors attempt to
answer this question by loooking at deep time: if this has happened in the past, is there
evidence left in the human genome of viruses forcing us to evolve in response?  

It's a bit of a complicated story.  Fortunately, the authors supply us with a "graphical
abstract" shown here (click to embiggen).  

- They use previous research to identify 420 human genes that interact with coronaviruses,
  from mass spectrometry data and from literature curation.  332 of those interact with
  SARS-CoV2 specifically.  Amusingly, they call these VIPs (viral-interacting proteins).
  These proteins are very specific to the coronavirus family.  
  - Proteins like these will evolve quickly under deadly selection pressure: survivors will
    either have mutations in the proteins that permit infection, or will have the forms of
    proteins that tend to prevent infection; those who do not will be dead.  
  - There's plenty of evidence that this has happened, e.g., with some helpful and other
    harmful genes inherited from Neanderthals 50,000 years 
    ago. <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>
    (__NB:__ Svante P&auml;&auml;bo is the world's expert on Neanderthal genetics, being the leader
    of the group that first sequenced Neanderthal DNA from multiple samples.  I've seen him
    speak at conferences: he's famous for slides with _no bullet points_: he just puts up
    pictures and talks about them in a very engaging way.)  
- They used the 1000 Genomes Project's data to look across 2504 human samples from 26
  different ethnic/geographic groups across the world, seeking populations that have fixed
  mutations (i.e., very high frequency in a population) in those VIP genes.  
- They looked for proteins that (a) showed adaptation in the same population at about the
  same time (using a mutational clock), (b) stopped adaptation around the same time in the
  same population, (c) were known to be related to coronavirus infection, and (d) were
  near regulatory regions in the genome associated with expression in the lungs.

The amazing result is that they found evidence of a coronavirus pandemic in the deep past,
in a single population (isolated because it was, after all, the Stone Age), whose modern
day descendants carry with them their evolutionary adaptations to coronaviruses.  


## A summary of (some of) their results  

### Identifying human populations forcibly evolved by coronaviruses  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-06-really-long-covid-currbiol-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-06-really-long-covid-currbiol-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="193" alt="Soilmi _et al.:_ Fold enrichment of coronavirus VIPs in East Asian vs non-East Asian populations" title="Soilmi _et al.:_ Fold enrichment of coronavirus VIPs in East Asian vs non-East Asian populations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
First, let's look at how they pored over human gene pools in various ethnic and geographic
groups.  They did a sweep across the VIP genes, looking for statistically significant
enrichment of the exact same mutation in group samples.  They estimated statistical
significance by comparing to a block-randomized genome (adjusted for confounders) to get
an idea of the False Positive Rate, and then got a final $p$-value by bootstrap.  They
also did a Gene Ontlogy enrichment to reject instances explained by phenomena other than
viral interactions.  

The result is shown here in Figure 1.  
- Each plot is an ethnic/geographic group.  The top row are East Asian groups; for comparison the
  bottom row are non-East Asian groups.  See how different they are?  
- The vertical axis is a fold enrichment for VIP mutations (presumably the fold is with
  respect to the block-randomized genomes?).  
  - The curve is the enrichment itself, while the gray bar is the 95% confidence
    interval.  It's cut off from above at 20-fold enrichment.  
  - The red dots, of which there are many, represent significance at $p \lt 0.001$, i.e.,
    there's only 1 chance in 1000 to see this at random.  
  - The horizontal dashed line is what you'd expect to see if there were no effect.  
  
So as you can see, the East Asian populations are enriched for VIP mutations by several
measures, whereas the non-East Asian populations are not.  Mostly these enriched
populations are from China, Viet Nam, and Japan.  (Is it a coincidence that the ancient
epidemic was in East Asia, and both SARS-CoV1 and SARS-CoV2 emerged in China in modern
times?  I dunno, but it makes me uneasy somehow.)  

__Conclusion:__ Certain East Asian populations show, with very high confidence, well fixed
mutations in genes for the VIP proteins.  No such enrichment happens anywhere else, even
in neighboring populations.  No such enrichment is seen for genes relate to other viruses
in East Asia.  So _coronaviruses have driven human evolution in East Asia._  

### Ok, so when?  

The next question: when did this happen?  

The first constraint is that the methods used here have limited sensitivity to genetic
events more than 30,000 years ago.  So that's an upper limit to how far back we're
looking.  

They used a variety of methods to hone in more precisely: Ancestral Recombination Graphs,
localization of the mutations near regulatory eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci),
and so on.  We won't drag through the details here, except to note that the significance
thresholds were impressive (iSAFE proximity test $p \lt 10^{-9}$, each VIP gene with ARG
$p \lt 10^{-3}$, and so on).  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-06-really-long-covid-currbiol-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-06-really-long-covid-currbiol-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="Souilmi _et al.:_ Adaptation of 42 VIPs clustered at 870 generations ago" title="Souilmi _et al.:_ Adaptation of 42 VIPs clustered at 870 generations ago" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The result was that there were 42 VIP genes who showed adaptation clustered around 870
generations ago (with a confidence limit around $\pm$200 generations.  Their Figure 2 shown here
(click to embiggen) shows the time of adapatation of the coronavirus VIP genes (pink)
clusters somewhere 770 &ndash; 970 generations ago, and that this is much more than other
genes in the genome (blue) have done.  This excess is statistically significant at
$p \lt 2.3 \times 10^{-4}$.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-06-really-long-covid-currbiol-5.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-06-really-long-covid-currbiol-5-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="412" alt="Souilmi _et al.:_ 42 coronavirus VIP gene allele frequencies over time in Chinese Dai and Chinese Han" title="Souilmi _et al.:_ 42 coronavirus VIP gene allele frequencies over time in Chinese Dai and Chinese Han" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
You can see the same thing happening if you look at individual genes, and ask when
individual allele frequencies started to rise.  This is their Figure 3, reproduced here
(click to embiggen).  
- The top row is Chinese Dai, the bottom row is Chinese Han.  
- The horizontal axis is time (generations ago).  The vertical axis is the mutated allele
  frequency, e.g., 0% - 100% of the population.  
- The graphs on the right are zoomed in to show detail around the time the ancient
  epidemic started inducing the mutation.  
  
You can clearly see that all 42 genes began spreading mutations around the same time,
namely 900ish generations ago.  We can also see that the spread of those genes continued
until about 200ish generations ago, i.e., likely a coronavirus continued to exert selective
pressure (i.e., kill everybody without the protective mutations) for 700ish generations or
so.  

For a variety of reasons, people use a generation time of 28 years per
generation <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>, so we're looking at about 25,000 years
ago.  That becomes even more interesting when we note that coronaviruses themselves only
evolved as a species at about the same time, namely an estimated 23,000 years
ago! <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  Coronaviruses almost _immediately_ jumped to
humans; this _will_ happen again and again and again and&hellip;  

__Conclusion:__ We'll let the authors say it themselves:  

> Consequently, our results are consistent with the emergence of a viral epidemic ∼900
> generations, or ∼25,000 years (28 years per generation), ago that drove a burst of
> strong positive selection in East Asia. Selection events starting 900 generations ago
> clearly predate the estimated split of different East Asian populations included in the
> 1000 Genomes Project from their shared ancestral population.  
> &hellip;  
> &hellip; we note that the signal is restricted specifically at CoV-VIPs and none of 17
> other viruses that we tested exhibit the same temporal clustering.  

### Ok, so _how long did that go on?!_  

Right.  So we know _when_ it happend, but _how long_ did it go on killing people?  

A rough answer for how long this went on is to look at the previous figure, and note that
the allele frequency stabilized about 200 generations (about 5,000 years) ago.  To get a
more sophisticated estimate, they looked for _coordinated_ changes in the 42 coronavirus
VIP genes, since coordination presumably indicates selective pressure from the virus.  The
result was consistent with selection until about 5,000 years ago.  So for 20,000 years, a
coronavirus was selectively killing people in East Asia until all those who didn't have
the resistance mutations were dead.  

__Conclusion:__ The coronavirus pandemic lasted from 25,000 years ago to 5,000 years ago.
Or, in other words, _it lasted for 20,000 years._  

__Note well that figure:__ just "riding it out" will take potentially _forever_.  Fortunately,
we have more resources than our ancient ancestors.  They could only engage in some minor
infection-avoiding habits and rely on their genes.  We have scientifically validated
interventions like masks, social distancing, infection-preventing vaccines, and
post-infection therapies like paxlovid.  

So, you know the drill by now: Mask.  Social distance.  Vaccinate.  Get paxlovid if you
get sick.  

### But wait, there's more!  

The study goes on to do a lot more stuff; indeed this is only about the first half of the
paper.  
- They noted the 42 coronavirus VIP genes are enriched for features known to
  interact with viruses (and even coronivirses specifically), which gives us some confidence
  in the correctness of the analysis.  
- Interestingly, some of the 42 genes are druggable, which is a starting point for future
  antiviral drug research.  
  - Four of them (SMAD3, IMPDH2, PPIB, and GPX1) are the targets of 11 existing drugs
    currently being investigated for coronavirus therapy, so that's a good thing to keep
    doing.  
  - Five more of them are targeted by multiple drugs for other diseases, so they ought to be
    investiaged for repurposing for COVID-19.  
  - An additional six genes are part of the "druggable genome" <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>,
    so we could perhaps find new therapeutic molecules there.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Whew!  Let's recap what we've learned, and how that informs what we should do:  

1. We know 300-400ish genes which interact with the 7 coronaviruses known to infect humans.  
2. East Asia had a long coronavirus epidemic that fixed mutations in some of those genes
   (but not elsewhere; little long-distance travel in the late Stone Age) 25,000 years ago
   to 5,000 years ago.  
3. There was continuous selective pressure on the human genome in East Asia ("continuous
   selective pressure" = people dying) _for 20,000 years._  
4. 42 genes were selectively mutated and fixed in the genome; of those 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 genes either
   are targeted by drugs currently in coronavirus trials or are targeted by other existing
   drugs or are in the druggable genome where the chemistry to make a drug for them looks
   tractable.  _There are opportunities for novel coronavirus therapies here._  
5. Evolution is doing it the hard way: people die until only those with resistance
   mutations are left.  
6. Vaccination is doing it the easy way: people get a couple shots, take a day or so off,
   and go on about their lives.  Don't make the stupid choice here.  

Again: Mask.  Social distance.  Vaccinate.  Get paxlovid if you get sick.  Support
research on drugging the genes above.  

I know you're tired of that.  But how tired would you and your descendants be after 
_20,000 years_ of this?  Make the smart choice here.
