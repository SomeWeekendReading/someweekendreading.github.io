Yesterday came news of the unfortunate death of a driver in a Tesla which backed into a
pond, whereupon the power cut making the doors unable to open and the windows essentially
unbreakable.  How many things went wrong here, and who could have foreseen this?  


## Inscrutable Safety Features Cost Lives  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-03-11-tesla-unsafety-cnn-1.jpg" width="400" height="110" alt="Boyette &amp; Riess @ CNN: Death in a submerged Tesla" title="Boyette &amp; Riess @ CNN: Death in a submerged Tesla" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As reported by numerous outlets, CNN confirms <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> the death
of [Angela Chao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Chao) in a drowning accident with
her Tesla Model X SUV.  

It's always sad when someone is hurt or killed.  Even more so when, as here, the death is
from a probably-preventable accident.  But in some ways what makes me saddest is that
people are paying attention because of _social status:_ Angela Chao is (a) very rich as the
CEO of a large shipping concern, and (b) the sister of
[Elaine Chao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Chao), Trump's former
Secretary of Transportation &amp; spouse of Republican Majority Leader
[Sen. Mitch McConnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell).  Her connections
via economic power of the shipping company she owns, her wealth, and her connection to
fame &amp; political power drive the coverage.  

It is a singularly damning fact of our times that we pay attention to the misfortunes of
the rich, powerful, and famous over those of&hellip; well, everyone else.  

Still&hellip; let's try to get past the gag factor of our fascination with the dominance
hierarchy of wealth, power and fame.  What happened, and what are the parts that went
wrong?  

### What Happened?  

Chao was on her ranch in central Texas, far from emergency help.  She was momentarily
confused by the touch screen controls for the Tesla gears, and backed up instead of going
forward in a 3-point turn.  This backed her car into a pond, to the point it began to
submerge.  The power cut, the doors would not open (and were under external water pressure
anyway), and the laminate glass is near-impossible to break.  She was able to phone a
friend for help, but it took 24 minutes to arrive.  After being underwater for an hour,
her body was retrieved, but could not be resuscitated.  

### What Went Wrong?  

Several things came together in lethal fashion:  
- She was far from first responders.  
- She was confused by the touch screen, as had apparently happened before, and shifted to
  reverse accidentally.  
- The pond embankment was too easy to go over in a car, apparently without a retaining
  wall.  
- Without power, the Tesla doors could only be opened manually from the inside, which is
  quite an obscure procedure (_q.v._) only for those who have thoroughly read their car's operating
  manual.  (Most of us do _not_ do that.)  
- The doors were under high pressure from the outside water, and even if released, would
  have been difficult for a small-ish Asian woman to push open.  
- The laminate glass is almost impossible to break, especially without tools, in a cramped
  space, and underwater.  
  
Once we make the fatal mistake of using a touch screen, that initial error is is the root
of an inevitable cascade of further errors.  It is not only inevitable, it had already
happened a couple of times to Chao going inadvertently into reverse.  After that,
everything else cascaded to make it impossible to escape and impossible to be rescued in
time.  


## What Did Tesla Think Should Have Happened?

The Model X Owner's Manual <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> does have a procedure for
opening a door from inside, to escape a car that has no power, as shown here:  
- _Front Door:_ Without any visible indicators for guidance, one must pull up _something_
  on the front of the switch group you normally use.  This apparently unlocks the door so
  you can push it open&hellip; except for the pressure of the water on the other side.
  (Oddly, this trick also apparently works _if the car is moving_, so maybe not something
  to teach your kids?)  
- _Rear Door:_ Again without any visible indicators for guidance, one must partly
  disassemble the finish of the door by removing a speaker grille and then pulling
  _on an unmarked wire._  Amusingly, if there's power to the car, it will apparently warn
  you that doing this may damage the car's trim.  
  
Here's a YouTube video explaining the same thing, though apparently in a slightly
different model.

Keep in mind that these procedures are (a) pretty obscure, beyond what ordinary drivers
are going to bother learning, and (b) something you must do under severe circumstances
like a car that's on fire, or sinking in a lake and filling with water, or in complete
darkness.  

This is not Safety Engineering.  This is engineering without any consideration of how
human factors impact safety.  In other words, an accident waiting to happen.  

I wonder how many times something like this has _already_ happened, but we're just hearing
about it now because our media obsesses almost exclusively with the welfare of rich,
powerful, and famous people?  


## Haven't We Been Here Before?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-03-11-tesla-unsafety-pro-publica-1.jpg" width="400" height="288" alt="Miller et al. @ Pro Publica: After fatal collision, Navy exchanges touch screens for throttles" title="Miller et al. @ Pro Publica: After fatal collision, Navy exchanges touch screens for throttles" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Now, something about this bugged me, beyond the macabre nature of the death and the
tiresome obsession with the status and dominance hierarchy.  I was _sure_ I'd heard
something like this before.

It took a bit of digging, and it wasn't about Teslas, or cars at all.  It was about a US
Navy destroyer, The USS John S. McCain, as summarized here in an article on _Pro Publica_
after 2 years of research. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

Now, a naval destroyer is a bit of a step up in size from a car, even if the care is a
"land barge" SUV.  But the fault is similar: a desire to use the latest tech had the
McCain's throttle and rudder control done by touch screen.  Apparently the software wasn't
exactly beloved by the sailors, but more importantly there's no physical feedback from a
touch screen compared to a wheel or a lever.  

And so, on 2017-Aug-21, the McCain collided with a 30,000 ton Liberian flagged oil
tanker.  Ten Navy sailors died, though apparently there were no casualties on the tanker.
It was the Navy's worst accident in 40 years.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-03-11-tesla-unsafety-ntsb-1.jpg" width="400" height="401" alt="NTSB report on McCain collision" title="NTSB report on McCain collision" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
One report blamed "training", but in fact one really shouldn't have to train people not to
do things that the equipment begs them to do.  Far better to remove the problem in the
first place, with equipment that makes accidents more difficult to happen in the first
place.  The NTSB report <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> finally admitted this:  

> "The design of the John S McCain's touch-screen steering and thrust control system,
> increased the likelihood of the operator errors that led to the collision."  

So the Navy blamed the crew and their training, while the NTSB blamed the controls.
Sailors were punished for failing to master the steering system that they admitted was
flawed in the first place and which the Navy admitted it didn't understand either.  

So now they're going back to physical throttles and _simplified_ touch screens on 32
destroyers over the next 7 years.  

Now, you might regard that as just a horrible coincidence.  But would it change your mind
to learn that a similar accident happened 2 months earlier?  The USS Fitzgerald collided
with a tanker off the coast of Japan, killing 7.


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Normally I'm reluctant to wag a finger and say "you should have known" at the engineers of
equipment involved in accidents.  People are pretty creative about the ways they cause
accidents!  

But given that similar accidents had happened multiple times in the Navy, shouldn't Tesla
have noticed that fact and learned a bit about the value of physical controls?

I'm not claiming they should be legally liable &ndash; nobody should take any legal
opinion from me under any circumstance &ndash; but I am saying it fits a pattern of being
high-tech just for coolness, rather than functionality or safety.  

Maybe don't do that?
