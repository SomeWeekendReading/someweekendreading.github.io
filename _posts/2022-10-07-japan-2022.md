We finally got to return to Japan to visit the Weekend Editrix's mother!  


## Getting Permission to Go to Japan  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-visas-lifted.jpg" width="400" height="149" alt="Japan to lift visa requirements" title="Japan to lift visa requirements" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
&hellip;but it wasn't easy!  

While Japan is now lifting most visa requirements <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, it
turns out (of course) that they will be lifted the day _after_ your humble Weekend Editor
returns to the US!  So, consulate and visa applications it was.  

The actual visa application with the Foreign Ministry was more or less straightforward.
Though it _was_ a bit stressful: we had to buy tickets before we knew that a visa would be
granted to me, placing some money at risk.  

I had to upload images of my passport, my vaccination card, my tickets, a _letter of
invitation_ from my mother-in-law, documentation of my marriage to a Japanese citizen, and
lots of other things.  

Still, it worked out: the visa was granted in about a week.  


## Flights  

Getting flights to Japan was a relative nightmare.  We wanted to go to Kansai/KIX, the
international airport near Osaka.  There used to be a number of direct flights, but no
more.  Either we had to go first to Tokyo (which previously ran the risk of being
quarantined in Tokyo for a week), or do something complicated.  

"Complicated" in this case also meant long and expensive: a flight from Boston to
Honolulu, a night in an airport hotel, and thence to Osaka.  The cost was pretty much
prohibitive to us, in our retirement income, at about 2.5x what we've previously paid.
This is why the Weekend Editrix has gone a couple times, but your humble Weekend Editor
has had to stay home.  

The flight back will be even more brutal: no overnight stay, just an eternity on a plane
going way further south than we need to go.  

Still, it's an opportunity to see Mama-san, who is old and frail and trying to survive a
pandemic.  One should not pass up chances, here.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-hawaii.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-hawaii-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Uninspired view of Hawaii from next to the Nimitz expressway" title="Uninspired view of Hawaii from next to the Nimitz expressway" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
So yes, we "got to" stay in Hawaii.  At an airport hotel next to a freeway, whose chief
virtue is proximity to the airport and little else.  Not even food: COVID-19 has made a
lot of restaurants shut down, including our charming little overnight place.  As you can
see from the picture, this is not why tourists go to Hawaii.  (Or at least, not me.  I
mean, you can see there's _something_ beautiful way off yonder near the horizon, but not
near where this picture was taken.)  

A nearby strip mall had a Hawaiian barbecue place:
[L&amp;L Hawaiian barbecue](https://www.hawaiianbarbecue.com/).  I'd always heard about
Hawaiian [plate lunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_lunch) and persuaded a
skeptical Weekend Editrix to try it by pointing out the Japanese _bento_ influence.  There
were, of course, frustrations.  For example, this particular outpost was staffed by
resolutely Chinese employees, all quite skeptical of the utility of English.  Should you
be so rash as to deviate from quoting the menu, there were looks of frustrated
incomprehension.  This made it difficult for the Weekend Editrix to get any explanation of
just _what_ the menu meant.

It was&hellip; _interesting._  (I think I'll consult with someone more expert in the genre
before repeating it, should the opportunity arise.)  

Mine hit the carb note really _hard:_ 2 scoops white rice, 1 scoop macaroni salad, and a
stew involving potatoes.  Tasty and cheap, but I probably chose suboptimally.  Also, a
strip mall might not have been the place to test the local food, but we were both too exhausted
to go anywhere else.  


## Arrival Procedures  

Normally arrival in Japan is quite smooth a process, and even somewhat routine &amp; perfunctory.
Not so nowadays:  
- _Immigration:_ I've never had such close inspection of my passport before: every single
  page turned, photo checked, other entry stamps examined closely, and so on.  I then had
  to display the visa, _live on my phone from the Foreign Ministry site with a timer
  counting down_, to make sure it was not just an image.  Then it was carefully and
  _firmly_ explained to me that my admission to Japan was good for 15 days _only._  
- _Medical check:_  There's this Japanese app called [mySOS](https://www.hco.mhlw.go.jp/fasttrack/en/), 
  which is normally used for things like calling for medical help.  Here, there's an
  aspect of the app called "Fast Track" for presenting pandemic credentials upon entry to
  Japan:  
  - Japanese are told to fill out forms with it for re-entry to the country: passport,
    photo, vax card, medical status, travel history, and so on.  It then shows a screen of
    various colors to determine how closely you'll be probed: red basically means "no",
    yellow means "you're going to be tested to a fare-thee-well", green means "test and
    quarantine", and blue means "ok".  For once, "blue screen" was a good thing!  
  - On the instructions to non-Japanese, I did not see this mentioned anywhere; I had the
    good fortune to have the Weekend Editrix in her capacity as native guide to point it
    out to me.  Had I _not_ used this, medical checkpoints at the airport would have taken
    hours.  Fortunately, we both got "blue" status and could enter, but only after _very_
    close inspection again of passports, vax cards, and phones.  The vax card was so
    closely inspected, I think the guy was looking for changes of ink within a line that might
    indicate some creative writing.  Fortunately, I was on the up-and-up.  
- _Customs:_ Fortunately, I'd filled out the customs entry card while still on the plane and had
  an obviously Japanese spouse in tow.  A number of other less fortunate non-Japanese were
  madly filling out the cards while under _extremely_ careful scrutiny of officials.  But
  when we presented the card with all the other documents, the customs guy apparently
  decided we were playing on The Correct Team and let us in.  

Apparently this all gets better 2022-Oct-11, when the visa requirements get dropped.
They'll still probably insist on vaccination by one of a few of the more effective
vaccines, though.  


## Universal Masking  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-daiei.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-daiei-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Scene in a Daiei grocery store" title="Scene in a Daiei grocery store" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The first thing that struck me was how much masking was downright _universal._  Indeed,
the US embassy page explained that this was the case, and anyone not masking "would
reflect badly on the foreign community".  Which is apparently diplomatic-speak meaning:
"For the love of Heaven, dudes, mask up already!"  

Here's a picture from a Daiei grocery store.  Note the universal use of masks.  Note also
that this middlebrow grocery resembles a higher-end US grocery; that's how Japanese roll.  

This is why the excess mortality in Japan has been _negative_ for the last few years: they
mask up so reliably, even without mandates, that they've suppressed both COVID-19 _and_
influenza.  We could learn from this example of public health and social responsibility!  


## Mama-san's 90th Celebration at an Onsen  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-onsen-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-onsen-1-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="Kobe Minato Onsen Ryokan Banner" title="Kobe Minato Onsen Ryokan Banner" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-onsen-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-onsen-2-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="139" alt="Kobe Minator Onsen Ryokan Card" title="Kobe Minator Onsen Ryokan Card" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Our next mission was to take Mama-san out for a short stay at an _onsen_ hotel (i.e., a
hotel with hot spring/large baths).  They chose a place in nearby Kobe, a short train ride
away.  It had _onsen_ and a Japanese buffet dinner and breakfast.  

So we adjourned to Kobe, with me as wheelchair pilot negotiating the train stations.
Japanese trains are wonderful: if you enter a station with a wheelchair, a station
employee immediately materializes at your side with a
[bridge plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_plate_(mechanism)) to help the
wheelchair roll into the train car, and calls ahead at your destination to tell them which
car you're in so somebody with a bridge plate will be there too.  Again, something
American mass transit can learn from Japan.  (After we fix the problem of _having trains
catch fire,_ which was a thing in Boston this summer!)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-kobe-harbor-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-kobe-harbor-3-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Kobe harbor: a pleasure destination, nightime view" title="Kobe harbor: a pleasure destination, nightime view" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-kobe-harbor-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-kobe-harbor-2-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Kobe harbor: a pleasure destination, daytime view" title="Kobe harbor: a pleasure destination, daytime view" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-kobe-harbor-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-kobe-harbor-1-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Kobe harbor: still a working harbor" title="Kobe harbor: still a working harbor" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
This is right on the Kobe harbor.  Here you can see one view with enough cranes to show
it's still a working harbor.  Turn 1/8th of a turn and you see the beautiful buildings,
shown here in daylight and twilight.  I like the idea of mixing a working harbor with a
pleasure destination; that's almost never the case in the US.  

At night, the round tower at the right has images projected on it as part of an art
project.  I _think_ it told a story, but I'm not sophisticated enough to know just _what_
the story might have been!

Basically, the _onsen_ hotel was a beautiful place with understated, elegant decor.  I was
too jet-lagged to use the _onsen_, but given my appearance that may have been a good thing
for the Japanese _onsen_ users.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-onsen-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-onsen-3-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Kobe Minator Onsen Ryokan Buffet (Viking)" title="Kobe Minator Onsen Ryokan Buffet (Viking)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
They had a quite impressive buffet ("Viking style" in Japanese).  The sanitation
requirements were impressive: wearing hotel slippers, plastic gloves, hand sanitizer,
tongs, and of course masks.  

There were a wide variety of dishes, mostly delicious, some quite mysterious.  I mostly
followed my family around and tried what they liked, both out of curiosity about the food
and curiosity about their tastes.  I can't say I understood or appreciated everything;
but it was certainly nice, after several years of pandemic isolation, to see the Weekend Editrix's
family and experience some of the world (in a reasonably safe way, unlike in the US).  


## Some Oddities  

Japan being the place it is, there are, of course, oddities.  Not that that's a bad thing:
oddities are a _creative_ thing.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-odd-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-odd-1-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Oddities: American Pharmacy?" title="Oddities: American Pharmacy?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
First up: sometimes people put English words on things, not so much descriptively as much as a
fashion statement.  For example, the oddly-named "American Pharmacy", shown here.  I have
no idea what makes it American; I didn't want to be the stereotypical foreigner who walks in
and yucks rudely at things.  It's odd, but it's the way they want it, so that's good
enough for me.  But still odd.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-odd-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-odd-2-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Oddities: Jack's Pizza &amp; Hamburgers: Make Our Hood Great Again?" title="Oddities: Jack's Pizza &amp; Hamburgers: Make Our Hood Great Again?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Next in our list: convenient to my in-law's home is this place, Jack's Pizza &amp;
Burgers.  Nothing too odd
about that; I guess stereotypically American food is an ethnic curiosity.  Sort of like
what actual Chinese folk think when they see an American "Chinese" restaurant in the US.  

No, what's odd is only visible when the place is closed: the steel security shutters say,
in pseudo-Germanic 𝔉𝔯𝔞𝔨𝔱𝔲𝔯 text, "MAKE OUR HOOD GREAT AGAIN" (definitely "HOOD", not
"FOOD").  And, for no especially obvious reason, an icon of
[the Virgin of Guadalupe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Guadalupe).
Honestly, I have no idea _what_ they're doing.  I suspect they don't know, either.  

I'm not sure if I would be _more_ confused or _less_ confused if they _did_ know what they
were doing.  Sometimes you just have to let the surrealism be what it is.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-odd-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-odd-3-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Oddities: Amity apartment building?" title="Oddities: Amity apartment building?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Sometimes names are calculated to appeal to something pleasant.  But other times this
backfires, sort of, and just leaves me wondering what's going on.  (To be fair, "wondering
what's going on" is pretty much my natural state.)  

And so it is here, with an apartment building named "Amity".  I mean, I'm all for amity as
the next guy.  Who _doesn't_ like the idea of people getting along, being friendly,
helping each other out.  And hey, I read [_Divergent_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_(novel))
along with everybody else.  (Didn't love it, though.)  

But this building precedes that novel, and so&hellip; what's happening here?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-odd-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-odd-4-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="150" alt="Oddity: Costco in Japan?" title="Oddity: Costco in Japan?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Finally, we went to a reasonably local [Costco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco) in Japan.  (I
don't quite understand _why_ we went there, but we did.  Sometimes my job is to bow,
smile, and carry stuff.  I can do that; understanding the rest is often beyond me.
Sometimes it's beyond me even in my own culture!)  

It's&hellip; _disorienting._  On the one hand, it looks almost _exactly_ like an American
Costco: huge quantities of everything, such as toilet paper in packages capable of filling
half of a smallish Japanese apartment.  It's weird to see all those English brand names on
boxes in Japan.  Of course, there are some Japanese items; we got some sushi to take home
for lunch that was surprisingly&hellip; pretty ok.  

But I don't understand why the Christmas decorations at Costco come out in September.
And, as shown here, the same thing happens in Japan.  In a country not especially noted
for its celebration of Christmas, except as a party occasion before the _serious_ holidays
around New Year's Day.  

Honestly, this one is pretty much a tie: about equal parts American oddity and Japanese
oddity.  I sort of liked the mix, after getting used to it.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-beauty-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-beauty-1-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="Architecture: conformal mappings in the complex plane" title="Architecture: conformal mappings in the complex plane" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Still, some oddities can be quite beautiful, if you're willing to look closely.  This is
an archway over a simple covered walkway at the train station near my mother-in-law's
house.  Look at the glass in the archway: clearly some member of my tribe was involved,
because those curves are produced by conformal mapping the complex plane!  

It looks to be the
[Schwarz-Christoffel map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarz%E2%80%93Christoffel_mapping),
at least at cursory inspection.  The part where it maps a strip to the upper half-plane,
and then the strip gets curved.  The only way for it to be cooler would be for the
covering to be wing-shaped and the window partitions to follow a
[Joukowski transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joukowsky_transform).  Yes that's too
much to ask of a simple train station, but can I hope to see it at the airport?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-beauty-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-07-japan-2022-beauty-2-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="Mont Blanc madness" title="Mont Blanc madness" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
After a short train ride, we ended up at the
[Hankyu Depato](https://website.hankyu-dept.co.jp/fl/english/honten/) in Umeda Station in
Osaka.  The basement is a collection of truly amazing food stores, ranging from a _bento_
lunch to various gourmet items.  (Sit-in dining is on the top floors.)  Shown here is a
pastry vendor whose mad _p&acirc;tissi&egrave;res_ have created a
[_mont blanc_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc_(dessert)) nearly the size of the actual
[Mont Blanc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Blanc).  Beneath the huge chestnut creme
exterior is an interior filled with creme, and some various layers of light sponge cake
(as shown in the diagram).  Not many bakeries are _so_ careful they show you a
cross-sectional diagram of the interior of a pastry!  

As a fan of pastry in general but specifically of icings, frostings, and cream, I approve.
Firmly.  Well done.  (Except it wasn't cheap, at around $8 per pastry.  Not super
expensive either, though, given the dollar/yen exchange rate right now favors dollars.)
