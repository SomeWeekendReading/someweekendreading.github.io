[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) why I haven't said anything
about the invasion of Ukraine by Russian.  Well&hellip;

## Two Reasons  

1. I'm in no way an expert on eastern Europe's politics, economies, or histories.  There's
   no particular reason to trust my own feelings, and thus _really_ no reason for you to
   listen to me.  At least not on this subject.  
2. It's just such a subject of _despair_ for me.  There are so many possibilities for a
   better world, and yet we keep shooting ourselves in the foot.  (And each other's feet,
   just to be thorough.)  The rise of right-wing fascism should be a shame to humanity.  I
   wouldn't want to write a post that infected you with my despair.  There are no
   vaccinations for that!

In the meantime, I'm trying to take advice from professionals, such as the
psychotherapist's video shown here.

__Summary:__ Your brain searches avidly for sources of danger, but only somewhat
desultorily for sources of good news.  _There is a lot of good news in the world,_ but you
won't see it if you don't actively look for it.  De-bias your brain by _looking_ for the
good stuff, because
[Sturgeon's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law) is a real thing.  

["Interpretation is an active choice that you _must_ make, lest the world make an unsavory choice for you"]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#your-humble-weekend-editor),
as I say with apparently tiresome frequency.  

But so I say again today.  Tiresome or not, it's the right thing.

<a id="fn1">1</a>: Not today, man.  Not today.  Too much crap in the world: right-wing
fascism, Republicans undermining democracy, screamingly hysterical anti-vaxxers, Trump
_still_ not indicted (let alone convicted and imprisoned), &hellip;  I need to take Emma's
advice above and find something good, just for my own survival.  Maybe you could do the
same, and tell me about your adventures in doing so? [↩](#fn1a)
