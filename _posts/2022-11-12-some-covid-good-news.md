We just _may_ be turning the corner.  


## Excess Mortality  

The indispensable [Eric Topol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Topol) draws our
attention to the global excess mortality situation:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1591574800925097985"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-12-some-covid-good-news-topol-1.jpg" width="600" height="650" alt="Eric Topol @ Twitter: Global excess mortality" title="Eric Topol @ Twitter: Global excess mortality"></a>

First, let's talk about
[excess mortality](https://ourworldindata.org/excess-mortality-covid#what-is-excess-mortality).
It's basically the death rate from all causes observed now, minus the death rate you'd
expect (usually a historical average over about the trailing 5 years).  Over at
[_Our World in Data_](https://ourworldindata.org/), which is what Topol's using, they
track the average death rate 2015-2019.  

So positive excess mortality means we're dying faster than usual, presumably due to
COVID-19.  A zero excess mortality means we're returning to normal.  A _negative_ excess
mortality, such as Japan, means masking &amp; social distancing not only stopped COVID but
likely also influenza and other diseases.  

So to what is Topol calling our attention?  A couple things to note:  
- The estimated excess mortality is trending strongly downward, back to baseline.
  COVID-19 is not over, but vaccination and previous infection have given us some
  immunity, along with effective treatments like paxlovid.  
- The 95% confidence limits &ndash; the gray lines &ndash; while a bit broad, have a lower
  limit below 0%.  So it's not _entirely_ unbelievable that the excess mortality is
  _already_ back to baseline.  
  
So, there you go: COVID-19 isn't over, but we're getting a lot better at not dying.  Now
if only we can get better at not getting sick&hellip; and not getting long COVID.
