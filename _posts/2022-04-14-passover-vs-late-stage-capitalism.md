So, it's Passover.  What might late-stage capitalism have to say about that?

## Exploiting Passover  

Yes, it's Passover.  (Also Good Friday, and a host of other religious observances.  I just
want to talk today about Passover in particular.)  

Here in the land of late-stage capitalism and corporate oligarchies, no opportunity to
extract profit may go unexploited.  Of course, Christmas is the most glaring example, but
other holidays get the treatment as well.  

Sometimes the intent is benign: if you're a grocer and you know your customers will want
to enjoy a traditional holiday meal, you might think of ways to sell it to them.  

So far, so good.  But sometimes it can go hilariously wrong, or even cause deep offense, if you
don't take the time and care to _understand_ people's traditions.  

Toay's example is from Whole Foods: they're owned by Amazon these days, but otherwise they
run a fine grocery store.  Very high quality produce, products selected with some care for
health, nutrition, and environment, and so on.  A little on the spendy side, but we shop
there a lot.  

But&hellip; somebody _really_ screwed up this advertisement:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
	Hi Whole Foods!<br>I love that you&#39;re putting your own spin on Passover, but
	offering ham as part of the holiday meal...is perhaps a skosh too much.

Ok, I'm a little leery of her cognomen "CIAspygirl", but she has the right of it.  There
are more things in this picture that Jews _can't_ eat for Passover than they can:  
- I mean, _ham?_  Really?  
- On Passover one eats matzoh, not bread!  So the bread rolls and probably the pie crusts
  are out.  (Can pie crusts even be made with matzoh?)  
- Then there's macaroni &amp; cheese: you can't eat meat and milk in the same meal.  So if
  the chicken is allowed, then the macroni is not.  

Pretty clearly, they don't pay very well to hire competent people to put together their
ads.  Possibly an intern inadvertently swapped the Easter &amp; Passover meal photos.

Now, as one who is personally religious:  
- If they had swapped into an Easter advert a meal of brisket, gefilte fish, bitter
  greens, and matzoh&hellip; I would not be offended.  Amused, yes; but not offended.  No
  doubt that's because I feel secure in my society, seldom the victim of discrimination.
  It _does not do_ to swap roles with people who _have_ experienced discrimination.  
- It's _important_ to respect spiritual traditions beyond one's own.  Respect for others
  is just so _basic_ that it's painful to see this happen, without any visible apology
  after the fact.  But apparently it doesn't drive profits in late-stage capitalism.  

Take it from [the experts at Six13](https://www.youtube.com/user/Six13Sings): they know
how to make religion _fun._  It's the perfect counterpoint, as a friend pointed out.
