The election is coming, with a possibility of right-wing violence and subversion.
COVID-19 is forming up for another wave of infections.  Winter is coming.  It's
terrifying, but there are some things you can do.  

## The election  

There's an election happening _now_ in the US, coming to a climax tomorrow.  (Perhaps
you've noticed?)  It's probably the most important election since the Civil War.  It's
_important_ that you vote, and that you not vote Republican for any office whatsoever: that
would just be enabling the bad guys.

[Here at Chez Weekend, our vote is already submitted](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/today-i-voted/) 
to the town clerk's drop box, and verified as "accepted for counting" from the secretary
of state's web site.  Please do the same: either drop off your ballet with your local
ballot counting office (_not_ the Post Office! <sup id="fn1a">[[1](#fn1)]</sup>), or vote
in person if you have to.  [Scalzi has a nice summary over at _Whatever_.](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2020/11/02/election-eve-info/)

Especially the last part from Scalzi: "Thank you for your attention.  Here's a picture of a cat."  In
that spirit, here's a picture of the Weekend Publisher, in his full Hallowe'en regalia.
Don't you just get a contact high from all the _enthusiasm_ wafting off him?  

But: for the first time in my long(ish) life in the US, I fear some post-election
political violence.  It _almost_ happened in 2000, when demonstrators in Florida prevented
the recount from proceeding until the Supreme Court could peremptorily hand the election to
the Republicans.  Now, it's even worse: Trump pretty much _promises_ post-election chaos:
legal challenges, telling the Proud Boys they have free reign for violence,
threatening to cling to power if he loses, etc.  It's a good time to take a couple days
off work, so you can either stay home or demonstrate (peacefully).  This is not going to
be trivial.

## Coronavirus and the winter wave  

### Strike 1  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-11-02-coronavirus-winter-of-our-discontent-mass-cases.png" width="362" height="400" alt="Mass tops 1000 cases/day for 9 consecutive days" title="Mass tops 1000 cases/day for 9 consecutive days" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
As if the non-stop horrors of right-wing political nihilism and stupidity for the last
generation were not enough, COVID-19 is _also_ ramping back up.  
[Submitted for your approval](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0297727/): 
the venerable _Globe_ today, in an article by John Hilliard (reference 1),
points out that Massachusetts is now reporting more than 1,000 new cases/day, _for the 9th
straight day_.  There have been an awful lot of exceptionally stupid parties in
student-heavy Boston, home gatherings spreading virus _inter familia_, the demented policy
of indoor dining at restaurants, as well as church
gatherings of people whose sociopathic regard for their beliefs allows them to refuse to believe the
virus affects them or that they affect anyone else.  (Don't be the sociopath in your
circle, ok?  Also, don't vote for 
[the sociopath](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/moral-landscapes/202008/the-psychology-donald-trump), either.)  

That's just [strike 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-strikes_law).  

### Strike 2  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-11-02-coronavirus-winter-of-our-discontent-mwra-zones.png" width="400" height="365" alt="MWRA sewage processing zones" title="MWRA sewage processing zones" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Strike 2 is from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA).  They basically run
the water supply, the Quabbin Reservoir, and some really interesting sewage processing
plants on Deer Island.  The processing is done separately for northern and southern metro
Boston and semi-adjacent suburbs, reacing out quite a ways (green & orange in the
figure).  

The MWRA folks did something clever: partnering with [Biobot Analytics](https://www.biobot.io/), 
they applied [metagenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics) to the wastewater,
and started tracking the amount of SARS-COV-2 viral RNA versus time.  This is as _unbiased
a sample as it's possible to get:_ if you use a toilet in (extended-)metro Boston, you're
part of the sample set.  Back in August, the venerable _Globe_ reported that there were
some suspicions of an uptick (reference 2), presaging an uptick in cases, then hospitalizations, then deaths.  I didn't make much of it at the time, since it didn't look statistically significant
&mdash; likely noise.  

I was right about the noise.  I was _wrong_ in thinking that there was no problem here.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-11-02-coronavirus-winter-of-our-discontent-mwra-viral-rna-tracking.png" width="400" height="297" alt="MWRA metagenomics: SARS-COV-2 viral RNA in sewage vs time" title="MWRA metagenomics: SARS-COV-2 viral RNA in sewage vs time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Look at the latest results on the MWRA web page (reference 3). While the uptick in August
was probably statistical nonsense, what we see today is obviously a second wave: currently
about half the height of the first wave in April, but rising at a slope equal to or
arguably steeper than the first wave.  

What this predicts: in a couple of weeks, there will be a desperate tsunami of
hospitalizations, followed by a miserable wave of deaths.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2](#fn2)]</sup>
Other areas will have other indicators, and perhaps differences of timing.  But if even
Massachusetts, where you can get yelled at for not wearing a mask in public, has this
problem &hellip; just imagine what's in store for the states where they still (somehow!)
don't believe masks work, or that the pandemic is real.

### Strike 3  
 
<a href="https://twitter.com/bopinion/status/1322937610348777474"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-11-02-coronavirus-winter-of-our-discontent-bloomberg-country-comparison.png" width="400" height="292" alt="Bloomberg Opinion: East-West Divide" title="Bloomberg Opinion: East-West Divide" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/></a>
Strike 3 is that _it didn't have to be this bad!_  Bloomberg Opinion has a nice tweet
thread showing that some eastern countries have a remarkably low COVID-19 death rate,
while the US &amp; Europe are correspondingly miserable.  

You cannot argue that the eastern countries are uniquely positioned geographically (though
with New Zealand one can note that it's easy to close the borders of an island).  Usually,
Bloomberg Opinion goes on to note, we explain that with what amounts to a rather
dreary colonial attitude of [orientalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism):
their culture is so different, they can do things we never would do.  This is a form of
cultural [essentialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essentialism), basically asserting
that cultural differences are the _only_ thing worth attention.  It saves you the trouble
of examining your own behavior for faults, apparently.  

In fact, while waiting for a vaccine, we can do what they did: 
- implement widespread &amp; fast testing, 
- do real contact tracing, 
- isolate positive cases found  
- provide financial support for people who need to be quarantined (give them a place to stay &amp; support their families so they don't keep going to work).  

We did none of that: testing was almost impossible to obtain (and in fact discouraged by
the Trump government!), results became available _weeks_ later when they were useless,
there was almost no contact tracing, exactly zero support for quarantinees.  In fact, we
_resisted_ doing even simple things like wearing masks.  

But don't ignore the better news from Asia: until there's a vaccine, control of the virus
is _possible_.  We just have to muster up enough spirit of cooperation to do it.
(But... we probably won't, says my inner cynic.)  

## What you can do  

Look, winter is coming. <sup id="fn3a">[[3](#fn3)]</sup>  People will be stuck indoors, in
close proximity, with poor ventilation.  There may be right-wing violence in the streets after the
election, which will further drive us to take shelter together. That's a recipe for
disaster in many ways, but one of those ways is COVID-19 transmission.  

So what can we do about it?  Several things:
- __Stay home, or work remotely if you can.__  Not everybody can do this, but if you can,
  you should.  Think of it as your civic duty.  
- __Get a flu shot!__  At this point, I have exactly _zero_ patience left to listen to anybody
  whine about their "skepticism" of vaccines.  You don't want to present at your local
  ER this winter as yet another febrile patient with headache, aches &amp; pains, and a
  cough.  You really don't: you'll be using up resources that real COVID-19 patients
  need, _just to stay alive_.  So get a flu shot, and get out of their way.  It's covered
  by all reasonable insurance and Medicare.  Even if not covered, it's like \$20 at your
  local drugstore.  You got this.  Just do it.  
- __Lay in some extra food &amp; prescription medications if you need them.__  In case of
  another lockdown or &mdash; Heaven forbid &mdash; civil unrest, you'll be glad you don't
  have to go out.  A bit of home preparedness now will let you relax a bit in the coming
  weeks.  
- __Vote, dammit!__  Look, it really matters that you vote.  You already know my opinion,
  but really: you can't possibly be _undecided_, can you?  Even if you're a lifelong Republican
  just now awakening to the damage accrued since Reagan... well, get over it and vote that sort
  of thing out of office at every level.  As someone who grew up Republican, I promise
  you: it doesn't hurt.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-11-02-coronavirus-winter-of-our-discontent-cat-relaxed.jpg" width="150" height="200" alt="Your Weekend Publisher, in Hallowe'en regalia" title="The Weekend Publisher, in Hallowe'en regalia" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Then you can relax at least a _little_ bit.  Maybe.  None of us, of course, will be able to relax
as fully and regularly as the Weekend Publisher, shown here exhibiting his skills.  He is,
after all, a master of the art.  (He has, however, not as yet told us how he would vote.
Felines are big believers in the secret ballot.)  Perhaps we can "rebuild better", in
Biden's parlance, a society where we can all provide safety and care for each other, to feel as
safe and warm and confident as the Weekend Publisher?  I hope so.  That's my dream, anyway.

## Notes  

<a id="fn1">1</a>: Too much Republican mischief at the Post Office: [72% of the mail sorting machines removed "for cost savings" were in counties won by Clinton in the last election](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/postmaster-dejoy-sorting-machines-stripped-for-parts_n_5f6d71d5c5b64deddeeb9107), according to [a federal court finding](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jq05j72ptz598ad/gov.uscourts.waed.91975.81.0_1.pdf?dl=0).  So... it's _deliberate_.[↩](#fn1a)  

<a id="fn2">2</a>: Though, to be fair, the death rate seems to have been declining.  I
attribute this to (a) some clinical learning in how to treat COVID-19 patients
(dexamethasone, remdesivir, ventilation in prone position, ...) and (b) the patient
population has changed. Most of the elderly are scared away from going in public much, and
with the start of the fall college semester, we're getting a lot of young, healthy people
doing dum things.  Their death rate is lower, so they may survive personally.  But not
without spraying virus to all they contact, including elderly or otherwise at-risk family
members, teachers, bus drivers, grocery workers, and others.  So don't applaud the lower
death rate _yet_. [↩](#fn2a)  

<a id="fn3">3</a>: I am apparently the last remaining human on the planet who has not
watched the US televsion show _Game of Thrones_.  I gather the phrase "winter is coming"
has something to do with that.  Me, I just _like_ winter. [↩](#fn3a)
