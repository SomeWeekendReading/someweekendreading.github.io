Romania has one of the highest vaccine hesitancy rates in Europe, around 50%.  They're
starting to get&hellip; _creative._  

## Leverage what you got

Now most non-Romanians, when asked about Romania will struggle a bit to name something
famous about the country.  Many will, however, eventually come up with the Dracula legends.
So&hellip; if that's what you've got, then leverage it to solve your vaccine hesitancy
problem!

From the venerable _BBC_ comes a story of just that.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
Apparently, visitors to the 14th century castle alleged to have belonged to 
[Vlad Tepes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vlad_the_Impaler) are being
offered the Pfizer vaccine as well.  

The plan is an interesting move, from the point of view of marketing psychology: show up
on a weekend in May, get a vaccination, and then get free admission to the _exhibit of
medieval torture instruments._ I've heard of people offering free food or beer or even money, but never
torture instruments.  I guess the fans of Dracula are a select bunch.  I wonder what the
Pfizer marketing department thinks of this?  

You kinda gotta admire the purity of it, if nothing else.  

What I want to know is: do they do it with 2 needles in the side of your neck?  You know,
for realism.  


## Addendum 2021-May-10, afternoon:  

A Romanian friend found the original advertisement on the official government Facebook
page.  And, of course, immediately thought all of us Weekend Readers should know about it:  

> I just saw your post about Dracula and as a proud Transylvanian I thought you might
> enjoy the actual original commercial. :)  I have stolen it from the Facebook page of the
> official Government vaccination campaign.  It says something like:  
>  
> "Who's afraid of the vaccine? Get your courage and come to Bran.  One little sting and
> then you're done (and no appointment needed)."  
>  
> They are also having vaccination at the beach, at the open air music concerts (at least
> I hope they are open air) and in drive throughs.  I really liked the Dracula one ,
> although I am seriously worried about the Romanian vaccination campaign (and the
> education level and effects of crazy propaganda).
