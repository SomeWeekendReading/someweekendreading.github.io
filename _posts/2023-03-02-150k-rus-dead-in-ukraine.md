As if the world weren't bad enough, today there's evidence that Russian casualties in
Ukraine have topped 150,000 dead.  


## Ok, so who says that?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-02-150k-rus-dead-in-ukraine-DoU-1.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="Twitter: Defense of Ukraine" title="Twitter: Defense of Ukraine" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Here at Chez Weekend, we &ndash; along with 1.8 million others &ndash; have been following
the Twitter account [Defense of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/DefenceU), which is official
reporting from the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense.  

Now, you could argue that since this is a Ukrainian source, we're susceptible to being
propagandized here.  On the one hand, sure; but on the other hand _nobody_ believes a
single word of what the Russians say.  The Ukrainian MoD has said a couple times that
these body counts are the result of actual counts in the field, so the true number is
probably higher.  [OSInt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_intelligence) sources
seem to believe that, based on spot-checking where feasible.  They're at least
_consistent_ with outside sources, while the Russian sources appear to be, at best,
orthogonal to the truth.  

We also tend to believe the high Russian casualty numbers because many other news sources
confirm Russian use of human wave tactics involving badly equipped, badly trained former
convicts sent forth _en masse,_ without combined-arms tactics.  

To be fair, this would be better from a statistical point of view if we also had Ukrainian
casualty figures, preferably from the Ukrainians themselves as a reliable source.  But, of
course, there would be intense Russian scrutiny of those numbers to estimate the
effectiveness of their tactics.  And nobody wants to help the invaders do better at
invasion.  

So, one-sided as it is, these seem to be about the best data we'll get unless there's a UN
investigation post-war, or a war crimes investigation, or something of that order.  


## The grim facts  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-02-150k-rus-dead-in-ukraine-DoU-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-02-150k-rus-dead-in-ukraine-DoU-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="653" alt="Ukraine MoD @ Twitter: RUS deaths &amp; equipment losses, 2022-Feb-24 to 2023-Mar-02" title="Ukraine MoD @ Twitter: RUS deaths &amp; equipment losses, 2022-Feb-24 to 2023-Mar-02" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

### People  

Shown here is their report: now over 150,000 confirmed Russian casualties.  Yesterday
alone, 715 deaths.  

This is utterly crazy.  Not just in the moral or legal sense, though it is definitely
crazy there.  It's crazy in the pragmatic sense to lose 700 lives/day _just holding in place,_
not taking any new territory.  

### Tanks  

Take a look at another eye-popping fact: 3397 tanks lost in about 12 months of fighting.
That works out to 3397 tanks / 12 months = 283 tanks lost / month.  (Not quite 10 tanks/day,
but _almost._) Well, ok&hellip; but is that a lot, or a little?  What's the scale here?
(Scientists, especially statistically literate ones, _always_ have to ask that.  Every.
Single. Time.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-02-150k-rus-dead-in-ukraine-bi-1.jpg" width="400" height="486" alt="Zitser @ BI: Russia produces 20 tanks/month" title="Zitser @ BI: Russia produces 20 tanks/month" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
A good summary source here is an article in _Business Insider_ by Joshua
Zitser <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, drawing on investigations by _The Economist_ into tank
production rates in Russia and the Dutch open-source intelligence platform _Oryx_ on tank loss
rates.  

1. _Oryx_ has estimated the loss rate at 150 tanks/month, much lower than what the
   Ukrainians are claiming based on battlefield counts (they're claiming a total of 1779
   tanks lost over the last year, which works out to just below 150 tanks/month).  This
   makes sense, since Oryx only wants to count "real" tank losses that have independent
   verification by some means or other, so that's probably an undercount.  

   You might want to assume the Ukrainians are exaggerating for propaganda purposes
   (though I see no evidence of that, so either they're telling the truth or they're very
   skilled propagandists).  Then their rate of 283 tanks/month may be an overcount.  
   
   So we should believe somewhere in the range of 150 - 280 tanks/month, and I'm personally
   inclined toward the upper end of that range.  
   
2. _The Economist_ thinks there's basically 1 single operational tank production facility in
   Russia, whose output is 20 tanks/month.  
   
   On the other hand, they grant that the Russians have a large number &ndash; $O(10^4)$ &ndash;
   of older, somewhat obsolete tanks in storage that may possibly be refurbished.
   However, the usual Russian "storage" means many of those tanks will be a
   total loss (due to poor maintenance, weather exposure, looters, or all those).  Even the
   refurbished ones will have to do without semiconductors that are harder to get in
   Russia (so very elementary/short-range sights, for example, thereby reducing range of fire).  
   
   Doubtful maintenance & refurbishing, lack of modern electronics, and obsolete tanks at
   the start are&hellip; a _bit_ of a handicap! Still, _The Economist_ thinks they might squeeze out
   90 refurbished tanks/month.  
   
   Let's go with 90 tanks/month total, instead of 20 new tanks + 90 refurbished, to
   account for the difficulties of repairing old tanks with scarce materials.  
   
That all adds up to losing 150 - 280 tanks/month, while producing _maybe_ 90 tanks/month,
for a net deficit of 60 - 290 tanks/month lost permanently without replacement.  (Also,
they usually lose the tank crew when the tank is destroyed, and training a new tank crew
&ndash; even on an older tank &ndash; takes a long time.)  

So they're __bleeding tanks at a rate of 60 - 290 tanks/month.__  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-02-150k-rus-dead-in-ukraine-bi-2.jpg" width="400" height="376" alt="Baker @ BI: Russian tanks in Ukraine" title="Baker @ BI: Russian tanks in Ukraine" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Again, we have to ask: is that a lot, or a little?  How many tanks do they have in
Ukraine, anyway?  For that, we turn to Sin&eacute;ad Baker, again writing in
_Business Insider_ and basing her report on data from _Oryx_ and a _CNN_ report from
military analyst Jakub Janovsky. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

While there are of course no official numbers known outside the Kremlin, the estimates
seem to converge to starting out the invasion with about 3,000 Russian tanks:
- If you believe the overestimate from the Ukraine MoD data above, all of those are wiped
  out and Russia is left only with whatever reinforcements they've brought in over the
  last year.  At 20 - 90 new tanks/month for 12 months, that's __240 - 1080 tanks left.__  
- If you believe the underestimate from visually confirmed tanks via _Oryx_ above, then
  they started out with about 3000 tanks, lost about 1800, so about 1200 of the originals
  remain.  Add in the reinforcements they've undoubtedly shipped for the last 12 months,
  and you get something like __1440 - 2280 tanks left.__  

At a burn rate (net of continuing reinforcements) of 60 - 290 tanks/month, that means the
Russians run out of tanks in:  
- (&nbsp;240/290) &mdash; (1080/60) months = __1 &mdash; 18 months__ (Ukrainian MoD data)
- (1440/290) &mdash; (2280/60) months = __5 &mdash; 38 months__ (Oryx data)

(Yes, I got those intervals by the very crude method of dividing high and low tank
estimates by low and high tank loss rate estimates, respectively.  This is Not The Way.  I
_should_ model each set of numbers by a shifted binomial distribution, then employ
[the methods of ratio distributions which say the ratio is approximately lognormally distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_distribution#Binomial_distribution).
(The math here is similar to estimating
[the probability distribution of a vaccine efficacy]({{ site.baseurl }}/beta-ratios/)!)
But in my currently post-COVID-19-brain-fog-addled brain, I just can't summon up the oomph
to flog the damn recalcitrant neurons any harder than this.  Better in the future as I heal, I
promise&hellip; but you _are_ permitted &ndash; and encouraged &ndash; to hold this one example of bad
behavior against me to make sure I do better in the future.)  

Well, that's a couple of wide ranges.  We expect the Oryx data to lead us to believe it
will take longer, since they have much lower tank destruction estimates.  They want
independent visual confirmation on every tank destroyed.  So I'm gonna go with the
Ukrainian data here, and __(crudely!) estimate about 9 months until Russia runs out of
tanks in Ukraine.__  

It could be faster, if Ukrainians are able to deploy Challenger, Leopard-2, and maybe even
Abrams tanks from the west.  Each of those should be able to hunt Russian tanks pretty
well.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

__Disclosure:__ My military knowledge and experience is negligible.  I've read a bit, and
I've consulted (very) occasionally for military customers some decades ago, but that's
it.  In other words, to a very good approximation I know nothing.  

Also, still working through persistent post-COVID-19 brain fog and waiting for
anti-depressants to kick in.  So down-rate your estimate of my credibility accordingly.  

But it looks like around 9 months, maybe up to 18 months, and then Russia runs out of
tanks.  

Now, Russian analysts in the Kremlin know this, and know it much more reliably than some
dumb guy with a keyboard at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend using business publications to estimate
force levels!  
- Are they telling Putin this stuff already, or will it come as a surprise?  
- Will Putin escalate, potentially to nuclear threats, if he (reasonably) feels cornered by
  this outcome?  

The rational outcome would be to look at all this, shrug, issue some bizarre propaganda
statement, and withdraw to Russia.  

When I were just a wee tad, I had great faith in human rationality: if only I could nail
down all the details mathematically, and speak clearly &amp; forcefully to the decision
makers, surely they would do the rational thing, right?  Now that I'm a grizzled old scientist,
bearing the scars of many battles with irrational corporate managements, I no longer have
much faith in human rationality.  

I don't like this world line.  Can I speak with The Management about switching to another?
