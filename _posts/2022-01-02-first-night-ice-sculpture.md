Against best pandemic advice, [First Night](https://www.firstnightboston.org/) happened
again in Boston.  Wanna see a highlight?  


## First Night  

Yes, they moved most things outdoors.  Still a bit dangerous though, so we hunkered down
here at Chez Weekend.  

But the next-day reports were&hellip; _interesting._  

There are usually a lot of very beautiful ice sculptures.  A prominent theme seemed to be:
don't mess with librarians.  In front of the main entrance to the Boston Public Library
was an ice sculpture of a spider crab _reading a book:_

While I'm immensely proud the hottest spot was a vaccination van, I did particularly like
the librarians' response to the question of how we know this is not a deer tick:

Like I told you: don't mess with librarians!
