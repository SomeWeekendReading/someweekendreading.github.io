Yesterday I had some surgery.  Today, after (mostly) processing the drugs, it's time to take
stock of the experience.  


## Sometimes Scary/Painful Experiences Turn Out&hellip; Ok?  

Sometimes medical treatment can be scary.  But, also _sometimes,_ the result turns out the
opposite of scary.  

### A Previous Experience: The Joys of Dental Surgery (Really)  

Case in point: about 20 years ago, I had some pretty extensive dental surgery.  The
dentist even warned me, "You won't enjoy it."  Cutting open gums, reflecting up the tissue,
quad-planing roots, stitches, all sorts of fun.  But:  
- Ok, the initial novocaine was "not much fun."  
- But after that, she went after the teeth &amp; bones in my jaw with a belt sander.
  (Apparently dentists have orally insertable belt sanders; who knew?)  But that was pretty
  much tolerable, and even enjoyable, because:  
  - She and her assistant were carefully watching my muscle tension, breathing, and eye
    tracking.  Every time I so much as twitched, she said something like, "Oh, I'm sorry.
    Did that hurt?  Here, let me give you a little more painkiller right there."  
  - I felt like I was in the intense focus of attention of two _highly_ competent women,
    absolutely determined to do well by me, and _care_ for me.  And by "care", I mean
    attention not just to my teeth &amp; jaw, but to my emotions in reaction to the
    experience.  
  - At one point, I actually shed a few quiet tears of gratitude, in the middle of
    surgery.  Hilariously, they misinterpreted that as a pain reaction, and gave more
    novocaine while gently holding my head.  
	
I have to say, it was one of the more nurturing experiences of my life, to my _huge_
surprise.  I don't generally recommend dental surgery as psychotherapy.  But that's how it
worked out for me, at least this once.  

You can find people practicing compassion at very high levels in the most unexpected
places!  

### So How Was It This Time?  

The details of what was being operated upon are both boring and personal, so I'll spare
you that.  Just take it as read that I was an anxious, nervous old nerd.  I wasn't worried
about the surgery itself (short of catastrophic failure, which was unlikely, but I did make
sure our estate plan was up to date). I _was_ worried about the recovery, which the
surgeon warned me would be painful the first week, and quite tedioously annoying for a month.  

So how did the hospital folk react to an anxious, nervous old nerd who was keeping it
together with sheer determination?  They dealt masterfully, is what happened:  
- __The surgical prep nurse:__  While taking down my info and making sure I was the right
  person, wanted to know what I did for a living.  After finding out I used to be a cancer
  drug researcher &amp; statistician, she wanted to talk about evidence-based medicine.
  Why methylene blue is no longer used in certain tests, how hard it is to get people to
  change their minds, 
  [getting our most recent COVID-19 boosters]({{ site.baseurl }}/yet-another-booster/),
  and so on.  
  
  _The net result:_ I felt I was among my own tribe, and it would be ok to surrender control
  of my body to these sensible people.  
- __Surgeon:__ Gotta admit, I haven't had good feelings about surgeons in general.
  They've tended to be a headstrong group, so sure of their personal knowledge that
  anything from me, a "mere PhD" could be safely ignored.  I have vivid memories of lots
  of struggles during my research career.  
  
  I'm happy to report that my surgeon was _not_ of that ilk, but rather the opposite.
  Every single time I said a single word &ndash; and I mean _every_ time &ndash; he put
  down what he was doing, made eye contact, listened, and demonstrated that he understood.
  He even joked how cute it would be to name the individual cysts being removed.  (I noted
  that my spouse has already named them.  Yes, it was cute the first time, but
  fractionally less cute each time thereafter.)  

  _The net result:_ I felt like I was entrusting my life with someone who wasn't just
  skilled, but also not too full of himself and had a sense of humor. He know how to wield
  that humor in a way that calmed his patient, and I was grateful for that.  
- __OR nurse 1:__ He introduced himself by name, and noted "we'll be together for the next
  couple hours".  Well, my body would be physically present, but my consciousness was
  about to take a long walk off a short pier.  It was nice of him to offer a bit of
  humanity to take the edge off anticipating that.  I learned that he follows minor league
  baseball teams in New England.  
  
  _The net result:_ Not much of a sportsball guy myself, but it was nice to
  know I would be in the care of a warm and friendly man.  
- __OR nurse 2:__ This was a short, cheerfully expressive black woman, with a mild
  tendency to dance.  I absolutely love listening to
  people's accents, and guessing their history.  It turns out she's from Haiti, and so the
  rest of our (short) conversation was in French.  It quickly became apparent that my very
  weak grasp of French was not up to Haitian Creole, so she teased me about that a bit.
  And then the rest of the OR staff teased us both about switching languages.  She put on
  the inflating boots over my calves to prevent blood clots; they were actually quite
  comfortable, almost like in a massage chair.  
  
  _The net result:_ Probably some drugs were starting to take effect, but she seemed like
  an absolutely lovely and playful person, to whom it would be a lot of fun to listen.  
- __Anaesthesiologist:__ I saw the milky fluid and recognized the drug as propofol.  Given
  the other drugs in my system, I may have been a bit disinhibited, so it's with a slight
  cringe I remember joking along the lines of "Ah, I see we're using
  [Michael Jackson's favorite](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/propofol-the-drug-that-killed-michael-jackson-201111073772)
  this morning."  He _may_ have responded something along the lines of "Yes, he was a
  great anaesthesiologist"&hellip; but I kind of doubt it.  At that point, my
  consciousness was fraying like a rotted flag in a strong wind.  After all, they don't
  call it "milk of amnesia" for nothing.  
  
  _The net result:_  The anaesthesiologist seemed to recognize the joke, or at least the
  last 2 functioning neurons in my brain told me so.  That was some comfort.   
- __Recovery nurse:__ I thought general anaesthesia would just be a slice of time that
  didn't exist for me.  I didn't expect to dream, but I did.  It seemed very meaningful at
  the time, but mostly I just remember feeling cold.  And then, as I was waking, the clear
  thought: "Ok, I guess have to go back into the world now, but why does it have to be _this_
  world?"  (I also recall a flip-book of different worlds, 1 page each.  Quite
  fascinating.)  Really not sure at whom that question could be directed, or what the
  answer might be.  
  
  The recovery nurse was quite reassuring, stroking my hair and telling me everything
  was all right, in a warm and calm voice.  She put a heated blanket on me, and said I
  could just take a rest if I felt like it.  She was monitoring blood pressure,
  oxygenation, and heartbeat quite closely while doing this.  I remember coughing quite a
  bit, though I usually cough a lot anyway.  
  
  She kept asking about thirst or pain, and seemed almost disappointed I wasn't thirsty
  and had only moderate pain.  When she helped me stand, I remember her hands being warm
  and strong, and her voice being reassuring.  It was perfect, for that moment.  
  
  _The net result:_  Ok, yes, apparently I _do_ have to be back in _this_ world.  But at least
  for a moment, there was somebody kind who was there to help me return.  

- __The drugs:__ You've already seen my lame attempt at propofol humor, above.  I can't
  really say what else was used, since there was not much of me left in running condition
  to notice.  But the recovery nurse had lots to say, most of which slipped past my addled
  brain at the time:

  - _Fentanyl:_ She actually seemed disappointed that I didn't have pain needing immediate
    relief.  (Maybe she really _likes_ alleviating pain, which in her position is A Good
    Thing.) But my lower back was kind of sore from having to lie on it in a funny
    position.  When I mentioned this, she gave me a bit of fentanyl through the IV line.
    There followed a conversation about how it's "not the dangerous street stuff" that
    makes cops so trigger-happy and afraid for their lives (pure cop-superstition).  I
    admitted as how it was a perfectly reasonable drug in the right time &amp; place, with
    the right supervision.  Not sure why she smiled at that, but apparently it was either
    amusing or she was being exceptionally indulgent.  
	
	The verdict: It made me woozy, with erratic eye tracking and doubtful balance.  It
    didn't seem to affect pain too much, just made me care about it a bit less.  It may
    have less of an analgesic effect than people think, if it just makes people shut up
    about pain?  
  - _Vicodin (or Norco):_ They prescribed me some hydrocodone/acetaminophen mix for mild
    post-operative pain, and told me to use it sparingly until I could switch to
    acetaminophen.  
	
	The verdict: Upon taking the first couple doses, it became apparent that Vicodin/Norco
    cheefully wanted to be my new best friend.  All things considered, I would prefer an
    arm's length relationship.  A _short_ relationship.  I've spent too many years working
    on drugs to set even a single foot down the other path.  
  - [_Cephalexin:_](https://www.drugs.com/keflex.html) Now _this_ is potentially my new
    best friend.  It's an antibiotic, and I am adamantly opposed to post-operative
    infections.  So we are allies in this regard.  
	
	The verdict: No overt side effects observed.  It smells a bit bad, but then so do I on
    occasion.  This will do.

Upon returning home, the Assistant Weekend Publisher, shown here, had some opinions on my
brief absence.  

I was concerned he'd want to get into my lap, with the no doubt intriguing smells of a
fresh surgical wound.  (It's a predator thing.  Don't judge him.)  

But, as you can see, he generally disdains laps as inadequate.  He prefers you make a
space with your arms, so he can get up in your face.  After some biscuit-making on my
neck, he curled up for his beard-brushing nap.  It's his way of saying: "Hands off keys.
Hands on cat."  

I bowed before the superior logical force of his argument.  

Now&hellip; on to the recovery, which the surgeon predicted would not be pleasant.  Well,
at this point I can cope with that.  Not my preference, but it's reality.  And reality is
the only thing with which any of us _can_ engage.  Or, as it says on my 
[quotes page:]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#:~:text=%E2%80%9COptimists%20refuse%20to%20acknowledge%20reality.%20Idealists%20remind%20us%20that%20it%20isn%E2%80%99t%20fixed.%E2%80%9D%20%E2%80%94%20Susan%20Neiman%2C%20%E2%80%9CChange%20Germans%20Can%E2%80%99t%20Believe%20In%E2%80%9D%2C%20New%20York%20Times%2C%202008%2DJul%2D26.)
> "Optimists refuse to acknowledge reality. Idealists remind us that it isn’t fixed." —
> Susan Neiman, ["Change Germans Can’t Believe In"](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/26/opinion/26neiman.html?_r=1&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print), _New York Times_, 2008-Jul-26.  

Time to be an idealist, in that sense.  Whether I like reality or not, it's what's there.
And it can, to a degree, be molded.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

These were people doing good in the world
([_tikkun olam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam),
[_pikuach nefesh_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh), and
[_imitatio dei_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imitation_of_God)), with good skill levels,
with good empathy, and good emotional care for those entrusted to them.  They are good
people, and I'm glad to have encountered them.  (Yes, this opinion may have been colored
by the anxiolytic effect of some drugs on an anxious and depressed old nerd.  If that
disinhibition made me more likely to recognize the good in others, then I can live with
that as a revealed preference.)  

The circumstances of the encounter, though&hellip; well, that could have been better. On
the whole, I prefer not having my body cut open.  But when that _must_ happen, it's good
to have kind people handle the matter.  

And, as always for now: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)
