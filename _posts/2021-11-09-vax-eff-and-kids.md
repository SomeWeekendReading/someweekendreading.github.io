If you think we can end the pandemic without vaccinating kids because they tend not to get
so sick&hellip; think again.  Try harder this time.  


## The benefits vaccines confer

Not all COVID-19 waves are alike.  Today from Eric Boodman at 
_STAT News_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> comes evidence that the Delta wave is indeed
different, partly due to the amount of vaccination, but also due to the concentrated
populations of vaccine hesitant who are causing the outbreaks.  

As the 2 figures here show, COVID-19 case rates and hospitalization rates are very, _very_
different among the vaccinated and the unvaccinated.  
- Yes, there's a small increase in cases among the vaccinated, but it's very small compared
  to the case rate in the unvaccinated.  
- Yes, there's a _tiny_ increase in hospitalizations among the vaccinated, but it's _tiny_
  compared to the unvaccinated!  
  
The unvaccinated are _almost completely driving_ the continuing pandemic.  

But since vaccine hesitancy isn't randomly distributed in the population, this has led to
weird risk effects in various subgroups:  
- The average age of COVID-19 patients has gone _down_.  It's no longer a disease of the
  elderly, because the young tend to be less vaccinated.  Either they are ages 5 &ndash;
  11 and only recently became eligible, or they think they have less risk, or simply can't
  be bothered.  
- Another pocket of COVID-19 cases relates to those most susceptible to Republican
  propaganda: white, rural, less educated, and conservative.  They are less vaccinated for
  reasons from superstition to misinformation to being victims of political propaganda.
  And now they are driving Delta wave.  
  
  
__Conclusion:__ Pools of unvaccinated people cluster together, and thus expose each other
more so they are the current drivers of infection.  


## Kids as carriers  

Ok, so some of those pockets of unvaccinated are just unreachable: the white, less
educated, rural Republicans are as fact-resistant as you can imagine, so there's not much
we can do to help them.  

But other pockets are more reachable, such as kids.  Is there evidence they're actually a
driver, so a vaccination campaign among kids would actually move the needle on ending the
pandemic?  

Yes, according to a paper I saw because of tweets from the estimable Eric Topol and
Bernard Lee:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    "Conclusion: Children aged &lt; 12y may be critical hidden spreaders, which indicates
	an urgent need of vaccination for this particular population."  
  </p>&mdash; Bernard Lee (@bernardclee) <a href="https://twitter.com/bernardclee/status/1457815116347437058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a>
</blockquote>

Hmm.  That looks like a contagion graph of a COVID-19 outbreak, 246 cases, driven
originally from 2 kids who spread it to about 75 other kids and then to adults.  That
seems to be a pretty good example of a pocked of unvaccinated folks (kids in this case)
who drove an outbreak.  Lee picked out the final sentence of the abstract, noting that
kids are an important population of "critical hidden spreaders" who are in "urgent need of
vaccination".  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-09-vac-eff-and-kids-medrxiv-li-1.jpg" width="400" height="308" alt="Li, et al.: Kids age 5-11 have high exposure in school and are hidden spreaders" title="Li, et al.: Kids age 5-11 have high exposure in school and are hidden spreaders" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-09-vac-eff-and-kids-medrxiv-li-2.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="Li, et al.: Spread network of a COVID-19 outbreak from 2 kids" title="Li, et al.: Spread network of a COVID-19 outbreak from 2 kids" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Ok, let's look at the paper: it's a preprint on _medR&chi;iv_ by Li, 
_et al._ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  They studied a population of school-age kids
under 12 in China, and their relation to PCR-confirmed cases of Delta COVID-19.  They did
the usual contact tracing, and that resulted in the graph shown.  
- The 2 red squares just left of center represent the "index cases", i.e., 2 kids who got
  infected and spread it to everybody else.  
- Then there are a couple layers of spread in their households and communities, until it
  finally broke through to adults.  
  
So, yeah: if we don't vaccinate school-age kids, they'll pick up COVID-19 from exposures
at school and spread it first to each other, then to everybody else.  The pandemic 
_will not stop_ until we vaccinate spreader populations like this example!  

In their words:  

> Conclusion: Children aged &lt; 12y may be critical hidden spreaders, which indicates an
> urgent need of vaccination for this particular population.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The idea that kids needn't be vaccinated because they have low risk is a canard.  They
_do_ have significant risk, and they have _significant_ risk of being spreaders to the
rest of the population thereby prolonging the pandemic.  

Want to end the pandemic?  Get vaccinated, get your kids vaccinated, get _everybody_
vaccinated world-wide.
