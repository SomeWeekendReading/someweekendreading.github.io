So&hellip; Super Tuesday, is it?  


## Super Tuesday  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-03-05-super-tuesday-2024-wapo-1.jpg" width="400" height="174" alt="Marcus @ WaPo: Supreme's won't enforce constitution 14th amendment vs Trump" title="Marcus @ WaPo: Supreme's won't enforce constitution 14th amendment vs Trump" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
You may have noticed that in the US we're having another presidential election.  You may
_also_ have noticed that the US Supreme Court has somehow, inexplicably declined to enforce the
constitutional provision against insurrectionists running for office, despite the 14th
amendment section 3 saying this is to be done. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

This means the system is, once again, struggling mightily to excrete Donald Trump.
Constitutional provisions are mysteriously ruled unenforceable, trials are curiously
delayed, and so on.  Voting him out so that he will be convicted and imprisoned for the
rest of his life is growing increasingly important.

It's an important day: [Super Tuesday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday).  This
is an attempt to bunch up a bloc of states so that their primaries are all on the same
day, and thus the party primaries don't drag on forever.  

Now, at this point, we need to remember that primaries are run by political parties, not
the government.  They decide who's going to be the real candidate for the general election
this fall.  It's more or less inevitable at this point that the candidates will be Trump
and Biden.  
- __General Election:__ Voting this fall will be crucial for the survival of democracy in
  the US.  Specifically, voting for Joe Biden.  _Nothing else will do._ Voting Trump is a
  vote for fascism.  Voting third party is half a vote for fascism.  Not voting is also
  half a vote for fascism.  _Your only choice is to vote Democratic up and down the line_,
  so Republicans can't continue to sabotage government in Congress.  (Don't worry if you
  think Biden has faults; there'll be plenty of time to lobby him after the election.)  
- __Primary Election:__ But for now, in the primary: it's not _quite_ a
  democracy-on-the-line situation yet.  The candidates will be Biden &amp; Trump; nothing
  you can do there.  If you have a childish _insistence_ on a protest vote for someone
  other than Biden, this is the time for you to stomp your foot and whine.  Do _not_ do
  that in the fall; hold your nose and vote for Biden.  


## Yes, I've Already Voted by Mail  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-03-05-super-tuesday-2024-voted.jpg" width="400" height="93" alt="Massachusetts mail-in ballot accepted &amp; ready for counting" title="Massachusetts mail-in ballot accepted &amp; ready for counting" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Yes, of course I'm following my own advice.  I voted almost 3 weeks ago by mail.

Here in Massachusetts, you can check the status of your mail-in ballet at
[the web site of the Secretary of the Commonwealth](https://www.sec.state.ma.us/WhereDoIVoteMA/TrackMyBallot/).
As you can see from the image here, they mailed me a ballot on 2024-Feb-01, and I returned
it immediately.  It's now accepted (i.e., ready for counting).  So that's locked in and
done.  

Look, I understand: Biden wasn't my first choice either.  Or my second, for that matter.
I really wanted to retire and work on the Elizabeth Warren campaign, but the world ruled
otherwise.  I had great dread even back in 2016 that Biden was a doddering old politician
too bent on compromise with Republican fascists.  

I'm happy to report that I was wrong.  He's had a great number of legislative successes
in spite of an intransigent fools in Congress, a court system packed with borderline evil
Trump judges, and a press that can't think of anything other than "he's old".  But he's
gotten those successes by knowing how to work the legislative system.  He's also got the
best economy I can remember in decades.  

Also, unlike the Trump clown car, Biden's also surrounded by _excellent_ advisors.  And if
he doesn't finish his 2nd term &ndash; a distinct possibility &ndash; Harris will do
fine.  She wasn't my first choice either, but she'll do fine.  

If you want to complain about Biden policy, do so _after_ re-electing him.  Otherwise
there's no democracy left to hear your complaints.
