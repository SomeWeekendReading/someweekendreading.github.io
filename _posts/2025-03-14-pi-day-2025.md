So&hellip; it's Pi Day again.  Didn't we do this last year?  


## Just Not Feeling Celebratory  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-03-14-pi-day-2025.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-03-14-pi-day-2025-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="Last year's thoughts on Pi Day" title="Last year's thoughts on Pi Day" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here's what we had to say [last year]({{ site.baseurl }}/pi-day-2024/) (and,
[indeed]({{ site.baseurl }}/pi-day/), [most]({{ site.baseurl }}/pi-reflected/)
[years]({{ site.baseurl }}/pi-day-2023/)).  Most reals, even exquisitely transcendental
reals, are best expressed as continued fraction with a nod in the general direction of the
[Dirichlet Approximation Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_approximation_theorem).  

All good, clean fun.  

But&hellip; not feeling it this year, with US democracy being eaten out by termites, and
the US science ability (close to my heart) being worm-infested by idiots.  Also, "3/14" is
a date notation used in the US, but little used elsewhere; the US refusal to be part of
humanity makes me very, very sad.  

Social Security payments are supposed to start for us next month, but that is in doubt.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The _only_ thing a responsible citizen should have in mind is: 
[_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)  

_Quick background:_ The Roman politician Cato the Elder was a hard-case conservative, back
in the empire that invented the _fasces_, which survives today in the word "fascism".  He
was so convinced that Rome should commit genocide against Carthage, that he ended _every_
speech, on _every_ matter, with words approximating those above: _ceterum censeo, Carthago
delenda est_ ("I also think Carthage must be destroyed"), or variations thereupon.  

I also think Trump must be deposed, charged, tried, convicted, and incarcerated.
Permanently, along with most of his enablers like Musk.  

And _that_ is about the only thing that matters.

Nope.
