This Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR) now has official personal data
collection and cookie policies.  You only _think_ you don't care about that.  


## Our Policy  

It has been pointed out to me that this CLBTNR:  

1. Has no officially stated policy on personal data collection, in accord with
the European GDPR 
([General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation))!  
2. Also has no policy on cookies, in accord with the [EU Cookie Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#EU_cookie_directive)!  

As a Europhile, your humble Weekend Editor declares [_mea culpa_]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#MeaCulpa)
in recognition of this fault.  

Therefore, we declare our Official Personal Data Collection &amp; Cookie Policies on this CLBTNR
to be <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

1. We comply with the GDPR by _not collecting personal information._ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  
2. We comply with the EU Cookie Directive by _not using cookies._  

There.  Everybody happy now?  


## The Weekend Conclusion

Maybe you _should_ be happy, given the generally slimy behavior of large web sites nowadays.  I
hear Cory Doctorow has a term for that.  En- _something_ -ification? <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

I mean&hellip; we all know you MegaCorp drones, law enforcement goons, and 3-letter spooks
are salivating over warrantless collection of our personal data, implanting
what you think are your sweet, sweet cookies, and generally stuffing us at both ends with
advertising, propaganda, and misinformation.  

But _even the Weekend Publisher_, brain the size of a walnut, can behave with some
restraint, as shown here.  Even though he's really not that bright, we still love and
respect him.

Try to do better than the cat.
