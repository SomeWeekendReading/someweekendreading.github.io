Today is April Fool's Day.  _Attrapons le poisson d'avril!_  


## After Trump &amp; pandemic &amp; all that&hellip; it's _difficult_

After the _annus horribilis_ of Trump, fascist insurrection, police murders of
multiple citizens, _and_ a pandemic&hellip; it's little hard to get into the silly spirit.  As
noted SF author Charlie Stross opined (sort-of-seriously) <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
maybe we should consign April Fool's Day to
[_damnatio memoriae_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damnatio_memoriae) <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
whenceforth the 1st of April shall be named the 32nd of March.  

Still&hellip; we can at least be
[trying to try](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WLJwTJ7uGPA5Qphbp/trying-to-try)
to approach a normal frame of mind, no?  

Let's go [trap some April
fish](https://frenchmoments.eu/april-fools-day-traditions-in-france-le-1er-avril/).  


## Hey, it's also Passover

Not so impressive as [Thanksgivukkah of 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgivukkah), 
but still pretty interesting.  To commemorate the occasion, I showed this 
[Six13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six13) video to members of my (non-Jewish) religious
community.  It somehow manages to combine Pesach with pirate songs and a sea shanty or
two.  (Hey, don't judge; it's Six13: surrealism is what they _do_.)  

I _thought_ I was being surrealistic and a wee tad bit transgressive.  Turns out, though,
I'm apparently in cahoots with a bunch of religious closet pirate afficionados.  They
liked the video so much, my email was clogged with pirate jokes.  (Did _not_ see that coming.)  

So to honor my colleagues colleagues, many of whom seem to be medical people who
are also pirate fans, I dedicate this little [koan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koan) to them:  
> __Q:__ Why do pirate obstetricians have the shortest lifespans of all medical personnel?  
> __A:__ One simply cannot expect to survive long after saying to a woman in labor, "Stand and deliver."  

Sorry.  Best I've got.  It's been a tough year.  For all of us.
