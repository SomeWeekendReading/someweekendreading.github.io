Today is Pi Day (3/14).  You're not still using decimal, are you?  

## The Madness of &pi;  

Many years ago, while happily working at [Symbolics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics), 
I was exposed to the mathematical madness of 
[Bill Gosper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gosper).  He was fond of using continued
fraction expansions for all sorts of odd things.  At the time (in the 1980s) he held the
world's record for largest number of digits of &pi; ever computed: first extracted as a
continued fraction using some Ramanujan-like formula, then &ndash; in his words &ndash;
"encrypted" into decimal digits.  

So I was pleased to see one day that in some ways the most compact way to represent a
rational approximation to a real number was as a continued fraction.  It takes fewer bits
than as a decimal (or binary floating point), or even as a rational.  

## &pi; Day Last Year (Pre-Pandemic)  

So when &pi; day <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> came around last year, we had just shut
down our research labs and I had begun working from home.  I had a long (17 year)
tradition of putting mathematical humor on my door to amuse passers-by.  This is what I
had put there a week or so earlier; it sat there for 4 months of sad, empty hallways until
I retired in the pandemic summer.

- Here you can see the first 12 convergents of the continued fraction for &pi; this encodes &pi; to many hundreds of digits, but with much greater economy than good ol' decimal notation.  (Just as a rational number is the root of a linear polynomial with integer coefficients, a finite continued fraction is the root of a quadratic polynomial with integer coefficients.)  
- The bitmap below encodes the first 256 convergents of the continued fraction for &pi;: each column is a binary number, with black denoting 1 and white denoting 0.  The 0 bit is at the bottom.  Can you read off the first 12 and compare with the continued fraction above?  
- And of course, the madness I saw one year when somebody baked a [picosahedron: 20 trianguar pecan pies, arranged with magnets into the form of an icosahedron](https://diyways.com/crazy-as-it-sounds-you-can-make-a-20-sided-pecan-pie/).  Now, _that's_ [the divine madness]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#TheDivineMadness) and the [spirit of &Gammad;&Tau;&Phi;]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#&Gammad;&Tau;&Phi;)!  (Why doesn't that capital digamma render?!)  

Anybody wanna bake a picosahedron?  I'm available as _sous-chef_.
