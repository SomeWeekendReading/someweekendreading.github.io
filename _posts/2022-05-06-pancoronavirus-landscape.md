What sort of progress is being made on pancoronavirus vaccines?  


## Well, a LITTLE bit of progress, anyway?  

We've written about efforts for a pan-coronavirus vaccine here a couple times before
([here](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/covid-misc/#research-on-a-pan-coronavirus-vaccine),
[here](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/pancoronavirus-vaccines/)).  Since a
pan-coronavirus vaccine could go a long way towards renormalizing life, let's check in and
see what (if any) progress has been made.  


## A survey of pan-coronavirus vaccine efforts

Our first stop, and indeed inspiration, is to check in with the awesome med-chem blogger
Derek Lowe, at _In the Pipeline_, hosted at
_Science Translational Medicine._   <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  He wrote a nice
little survey of the state of the field, starting out with a few general words about the
structure of the families of coronaviruses.  

So many of them seem to be related to bats&hellip; _why?!_  


## Side trip: why so many viruses from bats?!

First, I'd always wondered _what in the world is wrong with the dang bats?!_  Why are they
so loaded up with viruses, including SARS-CoV1 and 2?  The science explainers at _SciShow_
on YouTube offer some explanations:  
- 1/5th of all mammal species today are bats, so there are just _a lot of them_, and they
  pose a large attack surface for infections.  
- They're the only mammals who can do truly self-powered flight (not counting humans with
  our wacky flying machines).  To fly in a 1 gravity field with a thin atmosphere takes a
  _lot_ of power, and many compromises in other areas.  
- They're basically bags of germs, having transferred at least 12 viral diseases to
  humans!  (Mostly our fault of course, for disturbing their habitat.)  
- That's related to a flight adaptation: they have hyperactive mitochondria to generate
  energy, but that leaves lots of reactive oxidative species (ROS) around to cause various
  bits of biochemical havoc, including DNA damage.  
- To defend themselves from DNA damage-caused cancers, they have super-duper DNA repair
  mechanisms and prevention of damaged cells from replicating.  
- But DNA damage can come from viral infection, too, which is why it triggers
  inflammation.  To keep that down, bats use their repair mechanisms to fix damaged DNA,
  but _dampen_ inflammation (notably STING proteins, and PYHIN proteins).  
- So, because they dial back inflammation, they're infested with lots of viruses.  
- But&hellip; they also don't get sick much from those viruses.  We don't completely know
  why, but they do have really active interferon systems to repair DNA, and that also
  helps clear virus infections.  Also, something something ribonuclease L.  Basically,
  they have really weird immune systems!  
- And with all that, there's some evidence viruses have learned to go dormant in bats
  until an opportune moment arises.  
  
So&hellip; lots of complications, but bottom line: flight adaptation takes energy, that
can lead to DNA damage, so super DNA repair and anti-inflammation mechanisms allow viruses
in and weird immune systems keep them from getting sick.  

__Moral:__ Don't disturb the bats.  


## Structure of the coronaviruses  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-06-pancoronavirus-landscape-coronavirus-phylogeny.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-06-pancoronavirus-landscape-coronavirus-phylogeny-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="423" alt="J Cui, et al. @ Nat Rev Microbiol: Coronavirus phylogeny (2019)" title="J Cui, et al. @ Nat Rev Microbiol: Coronavirus phylogeny (2019)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Derek goes on to tell us how the coronaviruses come in &alpha;, &beta;, &gamma; and
&delta; families, all with funny pseudo-Graeco-Latin names.  The nasties are mostly in the
&beta; coronavirus family.  Shown here is a cladogram from a paper in 
2019 <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> that gives you some idea of the complexity.  (Click
to embiggen.  Since
it's from 2019, SARS-CoV2 is of course not there yet.)  Many originate in bats, some in
birds, some in camelids, and one in beluga whales.  

With that structure in mind, Derek then divides potential vaccines into 4 groups,
depending on how general their protection is:  

> Type I Vaccines: generate immunity to all four genuses of coronavirus  
>   
> Type II Vaccines: generate immunity to the betacoronaviruses  
>  
> Type III Vaccines: generate immunity to the sarbecovirus (lineage B) betacoronaviruses  
>  
> Type IV Vaccines: generate immunity to current and future variants of just the
> particular sarbecovirus we're dealing with, SARS-CoV-2.  


## So what progress is there?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-06-pancoronavirus-landscape-natrevdrugdisc-1.jpg" width="400" height="320" alt="Dolgin @ Nat Rev Drug Disc: Pancorona virus pipeline" title="Dolgin @ Nat Rev Drug Disc: Pancorona virus pipeline" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
That then shifts our focus to a paper in
_Nature Reviews Drug Discovery_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> which more or less
surveys the field.  Since a lot of these are very early efforts, while there are a couple
'real' papers, much of the "references" are to mere corporate press releases (and in 1
case, an actual _advertisement!_).  

Reading them is, frankly, pretty tiresome.  So let's just hit the summary that Derek made
for us:  

> Type I: None at the moment (that's a tall order)  
>  
> Type II: DIOSynvax <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, from a Cambridge startup working with CEPI.  
>  
> Type III: Walter Reed's SpFN ferritin-nanoparticle vaccine. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>
> GBP511 <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> is coming along towards the clinic here, too.  
>  
> Type IV: Gritstone Bio's GRT-R910 <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>,
> ImmunityBio's hAd5 S+N. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>

There's more, but that's a wide variety of vaccinations at various breadths with various
technologies, all at different (early) stages.  No idea what, if anything, will come of
that.  

Don't expect super-rapid development like the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, since those
were emergency crash-priority projects.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Beats me.

It's all pretty early phase, and the stench of press releases lingers over most of it
(with a couple notable exceptions).  

While we can hope, I hope that isn't false hope.
