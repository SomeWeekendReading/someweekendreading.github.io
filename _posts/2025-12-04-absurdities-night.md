Of course our timeline is cruel and stupid.  Of this, there can be no disagreement among
reasonable persons.  But&hellip; it is, very occasionally, if you look closely enough,
_also_ absurd in interesting ways.  Let's look at one serious example and a couple silly
ones.  


## The Woefully Misinformed are Now Protesting&hellip; _Batteries?!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-wbur-1.jpg" width="400" height="304" alt="Wasser @ WBUR: Some people now fear batteries" title="Wasser @ WBUR: Some people now fear batteries" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-wbur-1a.jpg"> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-wbur-1a-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="Roadside sign in Oakham, MA: No Battery Park in Oakham/Save Our Drinking Water" title="Roadside sign in Oakham, MA: No Battery Park in Oakham/Save Our Drinking Water" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
We're used to a sort of know-nothing NIMBYism now.  People oppose vaccines because they've
been duped, they oppose housing even in places where housing is desperately needed, and so
on.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-wbur-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-wbur-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="609" alt="WBUR: Top, former junkyard; bottom, proposed battery site" title="WBUR: Top, former junkyard; bottom, proposed battery site" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Recently I learned a new sort of know-nothing NIMBYism: opposition to battery storage of
electrical power at the grid level, to level out power demand.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

Without such batteries, we need lots more "peaking" generators, to supply electricity less
efficiently but on demand at high usage times.  The rest is very efficient baseload
generators.  But with batteries, the efficient baseload generators can store their excess
and release it during peak demand.  The round-trip efficiency of baseload generators plus
the batteries exceeds that of peakers.  

Also, battery storage facilities are very important for large-scale, green solar and wind
power generation.  They are intermittent, but coupled with batteries they become quite
acceptable for baseload purposes.  

However&hellip; the very wealthy fossil fuel incumbents will do just about _anything_ to
encumber green energy, as we've previously documented on this Crummy Little Blog That
Nobody Reads. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>

And so it is here:  

- Even though this will make the grid more reliable, admit more green energy generation,
  and bring down electricity costs by displacing the expensive peakers, people have been
  bamboozled into thinking it will raise their electric bills&helllip; because "green"
  means "bad" to right-wingers.  
- Someone has convinced the residents of Oakham, Massachusetts that batteries are always
  catching fire.  
  
  The distinction between "lithium ion" vs "lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4)"
  battery chemistry just doesn't penetrate their heads. They see "lithium" and think
  "fire".  (This is why they took the scary word "nuclear" out of "nuclear magnetic
  resonance imaging" (NMR) and now call them "magnetic resonance imaging" (MRI) scans, to
  appease the hysterics/testerics (just heard that word!) who get jumpy at the word
  "nuclear".  There is of course no radiation _at all_; it's just the magnetic moment of
  the nuclei that's being flipped around and measured.)  
  - There _was_ a fire at a facility in Monterey, California.  It used batteries with a
    _different_ chemistry, _indoors_ instead of outdoors, _without_ individual containment
    housings, _without_ the computer control of thermal characteristics, and before any of
    this was regulated.  In other words, nothing much to do with the present.  
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-epri-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-epri-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="EPRI BESS database: Huge decrease in fires, increase in deployed batteries, and complete wipeout of incidents per GWhr storage" title="EPRI BESS database: Huge decrease in fires, increase in deployed batteries, and complete wipeout of incidents per GWhr storage" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
  - Indeed, according to the EPRI's BESS ("Electric Power Research Institute" and "Battery
    Energy Storage System") database, fire failure mode has gone down
	98%, as shown here. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  
  - Somehow nobody ever asks about the fire risks of _natural gas_ pipelines, and even the
    distribution system into individual houses!  
- The plant is proposed on the site of a former auto junkyard, as shown in the aerial
  photo and rendering shown above.  So it's not like they're taking over precious green
  space.  
- The signs think that &ndash; _somehow_ &ndash; the battery storage facility will pollute
  their drinking water. I have absolutely _no idea_ how that idea came about.  
- Even more bizarrely, they think the batteries will somehow be _loud_, and annoy the
  people in nearby houses.  "Nearby" here is at least 1/4 mile away, so that makes
  essentially no sense whatsoever.  

Quoting Brian Benito, representing the builder Rhynland Energy:  

> "What I also heard was a lot of misinformation, unfortunately," he said. "And that
> information, once it takes hold, is very hard to dislodge."  

As activist Joe Curtatone put it:  

> "Misinformation about energy storage is spreading faster than facts," he said. "This
> isn't just a debate over technology, it's a battle over truth."  

Indeed!  It's almost as though there's organized resistance to green energy, flooding the
zone with propaganda in favor of the fossil incumbents, isn't it?  


## A New Internationalization/Keyboard Shortcut on Macs  

Ok, enough serious stuff!  

But on a related note, one of the things right-wingers eye with suspicion is any
internationalization whatsoever of the US.  Let's see what's happening in software that
might get their goat, if only they knew about it.  (Metaphorical goats.  Actual goats,
_q.v._)

It turns out that in German there's a funny character: &szlig;, known as the "eszett" or
"sharp s".  It means the "s" sound as in the English word "hiss", completely sibilant and
unlike what English writers would render as "sh" or "zh".  It looks like a Greek &beta;,
but is quite distinct.  

When rendering in character sets that are less accommodating, one writes "ss" as a reminder
that it's an "s" as in "hiss".  For example, the German word for "foot" is "fu&szlig;",
which would be written "fuss".  

Now the place where that interacts with computers is on MacOS, which takes seriously the
duty to work for almost all languages.  

There's a program called "ssh", for "secure shell".  It doesn't matter for our purposes
exactly what it does, just take my word for it that it's a thing some of us use daily.
Someone thought, as reported by "benjojo" below, that maybe something interesting would
happen if you typed "&szlig;h" at the command line:  

<a href="https://benjojo.co.uk/u/benjojo/h/h4N78m1PjXYsYfzkGV"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-benjojo-1.jpg" width="550" height="322" alt="Benjojo @ Mastodon: MacOS recognizes '&szlig;h' as 'ssh'" title="Benjojo @ Mastodon: MacOS recognizes '&szlig;h' as 'ssh'" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

The first bit of text shows that, if you type just "ssh", you get the help text for how to
run ssh.  The second bit of text shows that, if you type "&szlig;h", MacOS translates "&szlig;" to
"ss" and you get the same thing!  (NT folk who are on-members of the computer-oriented
nerd tribe will just have to take my word for it that this is amazing and hilarious.)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sharp-ssh.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sharp-ssh-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="185" alt="Yes indeed: in MacOS Monterey 26.1, as of 2025-Dec-03, '&szlig;h' is recognized as 'ssh'" title="Yes indeed: in MacOS Monterey 26.1, as of 2025-Dec-03, '&szlig;h' is recognized as 'ssh'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
So I couldn't just take his word for it, I _had_ to try it.  Here is the evidence on my
MacOS system (Monterey 26.1, vintage 2025-December).  Indeed, the text at the top and
bottom are the same: "&szlig;h" gets 'translated' into "ssh".  

Someone at Apple had better be giggling right now, and giggling pretty dang _hard!_
Because, intentional or not, this is just brilliant.  

It makes me wonder &ndash; but not enough to try &ndash; what it would do with the &eth;
and &thorn; (eth and thorn) characters?  Those used to be in the English alphabet,
representing the "th" sound, voiced and unvoiced, respectively.   <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>
Any suggestions for Unixoid commands involving "th"?  


## Windows 11 Finally Makes Sense!  

All the big CEOs are convinced LLM AI is going to make it possible for them to fire there
employees and rake in the cash.  No less than Microsoft apparently is all-in on that idea,
which makes sense given their "investments" in data centers.  

From Steve Lieber on Mastodon comes an interesting juxtaposition of 2 facts from
_TechCrunch_ and Reddit:  

<a href="https://mastodon.social/@stevelieber/115600596642853677"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-mastodon-1.jpg" width="550" height="664" alt="Facts: (1) ~30% of Microsoft code is written by AI, and (2) almost all major Windows 11 core features are broken" title="Facts: (1) ~30% of Microsoft code is written by AI, and (2) almost all major Windows 11 core features are broken" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

Ok, when you put it that way, Windows 11 makes sense: it _didn't even have a chance_ of
working?!  Suddenly, I understand why Windows is so difficult &amp; unreliable that only
an MBA could love it.  

Really the only surprise is that they admit it?  


## Yuletide&hellip; Celebrations?  

We have now entered the season of the year when all sorts of year-end celebrations happen
in a variety of traditions.  Most of them are beautiful, some are very silly, and a
select few are both beautiful _and_ very silly.  

Of course you know which of those groups fascinate me most, don't you?  

### G&auml;vlebocken: The G&auml;vle Goat  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-gavle-goat.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-gavle-goat-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="251" alt="2025: The G&auml;vle Goat" title="2025: The G&auml;vle Goat" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
In the Swedish city of G&auml;vle, they have
[a tradition dating back to about 1966](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4vle_goat).  

For no reason that is particularly obvious to me, they decided to build a giant "yule
goat" sculpture out of bales of hay, light it up, and have various parties, festivals, and
so on.  I don't get the G&auml;vlebocken ("G&auml;vle goat") part, but having a reason to
celebrate warm feelings with each other at a cold &amp; dark time of year makes perfect
sense.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-04-absurdities-night-scarecrow.jpg" width="284" height="545" alt="L Frank Baum's Scarecrow character, from The Wizard of Oz" title="L Frank Baum's Scarecrow character, from The Wizard of Oz" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
There is another bizarre "tradition": the young men of the area attempt to set fire to the 
G&auml;vlebocken.  As of this year, 49 out of the 52 goats have been burned down.  This is,
of course, illegal in highly civilized Sweden.  But&hellip; things happen.  

Here you see a picture of the 2025 iteration of this straw goat
tradition. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  And yes, _of course_ there's a live webcam so
you can check in on the state of the goat, to see if it's on fire.  

I don't actually know which side to root for here. I suspect the local fire department and
the elaborate system of goat guardians have a safety system all worked out, since it's
been needed 49/52 times.  

I wish the goat good luck.  To the extent that "luck" means anything at all, let alone for
an inanimate sculpture out of hay.  Perhaps the
[Scarecrow of Oz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarecrow_(Oz)) would like a word?  He is,
after all, the wisest being in Oz and has previous experience with being made of hay and
escaping attack by fire.  (Admittedly, a witch instead of pranksters, but still&hellip;
_experience._)  

### Krampusnacht!  

And now, on to serious matters: our second annual <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> 
"Gru&szlig; von Krampus!" post.  (Remember that &szlig; character above?  "Gruss" means "Greetings".)  

December 05 is Krampusnacht, the night when St Nicolas and his "assistant"
Krampus <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> come to evaluate children.  

As we wrote last year upon this occasion:  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-12-06-gruss-von-krampus.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-12-06-gruss-von-krampus-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="635" alt="Krampus abducting a bad little boy, with a strangely indifferent good little girl looking on" title="Krampus abducting a bad little boy, with a strangely indifferent good little girl looking on" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Once again, here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, we politely wonder if the esteemed Mr. Krampus
could pay a visit to come evaluate Mr. Trump for deportation to Spain&hellip; or perhaps even
warmer climes?  I mean, he's trying _so hard_ to earn that privilege!  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Ok, the battery thing is just dispiriting; all the disinformation seems to pull to the
right-wingers, here toward fossil fuels.  But beyond the cruelty and stupidity of
right-wing fascism revenant worldwide, our world is also absurd in amusing ways&hellip;
sometimes.  Let's enjoy the silliness of the rest of the stories.

And enjoy each other, as we are all, in the end, quite silly.  

So enjoy the surreal.  At least if, like me, you love surrealism.  

Which you should!
