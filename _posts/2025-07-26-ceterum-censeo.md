[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about a t-shirt they saw.
Now, why would anybody do _that?_  


## _Ceterum Censeo_&hellip;  

Perhaps you've noticed that, for _several years now,_ I've been ending each blog entry
in this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR) with a little Latin _post scriptum._  

It is in reference to how
[Cato the Elder (234–149 BCE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder),
a Roman Senator, was said to end every speech, on every topic:  

> [Ceterum censeo](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ceterum_censeo), Carthago delendam esse.
> (Furthermore, I think Carthage must be destroyed.)  

The exact wording is not known, and he may have changed it from time to time.  I've seen a
couple variations in the exact verb tense, for example: that gerundive/future passive
participle construction, used to indicate _necessity/propriety,_ has always been a tricksy
little inflection to me.  But the meaning is clear, modulo tense fussiness: Cato wanted a
war of annihilation against Carthage, Rome's periodic rival.  

Now, I'm no fan of ol' Marcus Porcius Cato here.  He was a right bastard: a fascist
authoritarian rich guy, in a state from whom we _derive_ our word for fascism
(L. _fasces_)!  But&hellip; I have to admire his persistence.  He _simply would not let
go_ of the idea that Carthage was a persistent threat, and had to be dealt with
accordingly, lest the threat to Rome come back repeatedly.  

Here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, we feel similarly about the threat Trump is now executing
upon American democracy and upon civilization itself.  He of course _should_ have been
impeached &amp; removed during his first term.  He _should_ have been convicted of a
number of felonies, most importantly the mishandling of secret documents.  

Yet, here we are.  

So, one might translate my dog-Latin as:  

> Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse.  (Furthermore, I think Trump must be incarcerated.)  

Feel free to correct my Latin.  Everyone does, eventually.  


## Ceterum lego&hellip;  (Furthermore, I read&hellip;)  

At long last, there is evidence that this has not gone unnoticed among my (very, _very_ few)
readers!  An eagle-eyed member of the Weekend Commentariat, Pablo, told me he saw a t-shirt and
thought of me.  

Ummm&hellip; what?  

Attend: for it shall make sense!  (Eventually.)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-26-ceterum-censeo-shirt.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-26-ceterum-censeo-shirt-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="408" alt="Echos of Antiquity shirt: Carthago delenda est" title="Echos of Antiquity shirt: Carthago delenda est" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
He saw the t-shrt shown here, sold by
[_Echos of Antiquity_](https://echosofantiquity.com/products/carthago-delenda-est-mortons-salt-parody-logo-t-shirt?variant=51562587488523).
(No, they are not sponsoring this blog in anyway.  They just happen to be brilliant, and I
just happen to admire brilliance of this sort.)  Now, they've chosen a slight syntactic variant
which is not my favorite ("delenda" _vs_ "delendam"), but it's in the zone.  

And this metaphor is just about _perfect_, in eleventeen separate dimensions.  Please
permit my inner pedant to squee about it for you:  

1. First, it's making fun of a logo which is _extremely_ recognizable to anyone who's
   bought salt in the US over the last century.  The Morton Salt company in 1911 adopted
   the logo <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> of a girl walking in the rain with an
   umbrella, trailing salt behind her from a leaky salt package.  
   
   What does a girl spilling salt while walking in the rain have to do with anything?
   Basically, pure salt in wet or humid weather absorbs water and clumps up to the point
   where it won't flow, or won't come out of a shaker.  This is why some restaurants in
   humid climates put uncooked rice in the salt shakers, to absorb the water.  The food
   chemists at Morton discovered adding first magnesium carbonate (replaced later with calcium silicate)
   would fix this problem.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  
   
   The salt would flow freely even in moist conditions, hence the phrase "When it rains,
   it pours."  The little girl absent-mindedly unaware of the leak in the package while
   walking in the rain is a near-perfect illustration of this.  
   
   Step 1 in any good satire is to pick an easily recognizable trope.  So far, mission
   accomplished.  Now&hellip; how has that been altered for this joke's purposes?  

2. She's wearing sandals, especially ones with the leather laces that go around the
   ankles, very suggestive of ancient Mediterranean culture.  The legions would wear
   [_caligae_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligae) that look like this; ordinary people
   would wear lighter-weight versions of that called [_crepidae_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crepida).
   (Though I may be a bit
   [_supra crepidam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ne_supra_crepidam#:~:text=ne%20supra%20crepidam%20sutor%20iudicaret%5B1%5D%20(%22Let%20the%20cobbler%20not%20judge%20beyond%20the%20crepida%22))
   here! :-)  

3. She's wearing a singlet/shift with a tie around the waist, resembling a
   [Roman tunic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunic#Roman_tunic).  These were often
   dyed/bleached white, as that was cheap to do.  

4. Her tunic is emblazoned "[SPQR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPQR)", which in Roman
   times meant "Senatus Populusque Romanus", or "the Roman Senate and People" (the "Q" is
   the "-que" enclitic which encodes an "and" before the noun to which it's attached).

   This was blazoned on coins, documents, and the sigils carried in front of legions.  It
   emphasized the governmental authority of whatever document or group of soldiers were
   using it.  

   It fairly screams "by the authority of the Roman government".  

5. Spilling _salt_ specifically is on point: it was of great value in the ancient world,
   with salt mining likely under a local monarch's control.

   A slightly doubtful tradition says portion of the compensation of a Roman soldier was
   paid in salt to add to food.  This was the
   [_salarium,_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary#Salarium) which is where English
   gets the word "salary" and the expression that someone is "worth their salt."  

6. At the end of the 3rd Punic War, the Roman general Scipio Africanus pretty much nuked
   Carthage: sacked the city, killed the men, enslaved the women &amp; children, and
   destroyed all the buildings.  
   
   A dubious tradition, sometimes ambiguous in medieval times, but really established in
   modern times in the 19th century, says Scipio Africanus also
   [had all the fields plowed up and then salt plowed into them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salting_the_earth#Carthage).
   This would have made the land into a desert unsuitable for agriculture for many generations,
   perhaps forever.  
   
   This would _complete_ the destruction of Carthage, making it impossible to rebuild.  

So our innocent little girl is&hellip; reprising &amp; commemorating a Roman genocide,
with enthusiastic detail? Though, to be fair, Carthaginian culture was not exactly
admirable.  Their 
[Moloch worship, involving torturing children to death,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch)
is just the start, really.  My sympathy for them is quite limited.  Maybe not zero, but
certainly not a lot.  

It's really hard for nerds of a certain stripe to resist this!  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-26-ceterum-censeo-heso-ten-publishers.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-07-26-ceterum-censeo-heso-ten-publishers-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="323" alt="The Weekend Publisher &amp; Assistant Weekend Publisher in yoga classes, practicing their 'heso-ten' poses" title="The Weekend Publisher &amp; Assistant Weekend Publisher in yoga classes, practicing their 'heso-ten' poses" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Sometimes it's hard for us Asperger-ish nerds to communicate to NTs just how _wonderful_ our
obsessions are.  So it is, often, with oddities of Latin and other ancient languages.
Most people don't get it, and even outright _refuse_ to get it, and won't even _try_ to
get it.  

For example, like all good editors with a cool story, I tried to explain it to the Weekend
Publisher and the Assistant Weekend Publisher.  However, as you can see here, they were
engaged in yoga classes perfecting their _heso-ten_ poses.  (Japanese: "navel to the
heavens".  No, it's not a real yoga pose.  Did you really expect that? It's just how we
speak Cat Japanese here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend.)  

Still, in these difficult times, I envy their ability to relax.  

We should help create a world to which that level of relaxation is a _proper_ response.  

And, of course, once more with feeling: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)
