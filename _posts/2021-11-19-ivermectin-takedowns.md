The right-wing knuckleheadedness around ivermectin as a COVID-19 therapy continues to
amaze me.  This week I came across 2 ivermectin takedowns: a Malaysian clinical trial and
Scott Alexander's dissection of the ivmmeta.com metanalysis.  Two thumbs down.  Way down.  


## OK, why are people so shouty about this ivermectin stuff?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-structure.png" width="250" height="195" alt="Wikipedia: ivermectin structure" title="Wikipedia: ivermectin structure" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
[Ivermectin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin) is a drug used to treat
infestations of non-vertebrate parasites (think intestinal worms, or a topical lotion for
head lice).  

It has mostly veterinary applications in the US, since farm animals get worms regularly,
but people rarely do.  But that's not the case everywhere, and even in the US people
occasionally get worms and need treatment.  That's what ivermectin does, and does very
well.  

I'm going to vent a certain amount of invective about ivermectin here, but don't get me
wrong: it's a perfectly fine drug, _in the case of parasite infestations._ Campbell &amp;
Omura even got the 2015 Nobel in medicine for its discovery in the 1970s.  It's even
on the
[WHO's list of esential medicines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO_Model_List_of_Essential_Medicines#Anthelminthics).
If you have worms, ivermectin is your new best friend.  If you don't, then not.  

So please understand: my animus on the subject is not about ivermectin for the usual
applications, where it's just fine; rather, it's about knuckleheads spreading
disinformation that it's a COVID-19 cure.  Belief in that nonsense kills people.  

### But&hellip; COVID-19?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-fda-warning.jpg" width="400" height="109" alt="FDA: please don't take ivermectin for COVID-19" title="FDA: please don't take ivermectin for COVID-19" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
It's gotten so bad that the FDA has to put out consumer updates like the one shown here
<sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> reminding you not to go to your farm supply store and
take horse paste.  We shouldn't need to be told that, but (as all the existentialists say)
here we are, nonetheless.  Probably people who buy into this sort of conspiracy theory won't trust
the FDA or even notice the consumer update, but the FDA's trying to be responsible here.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-reuters-1.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Reuters Fact Check: molnupiravir is not ivermectin" title="Reuters Fact Check: molnupiravir is not ivermectin" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-reuters-2.jpg" width="400" height="272" alt="Reuters Fact Check: molnupiravir is STILL not ivermectin" title="Reuters Fact Check: molnupiravir is STILL not ivermectin" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
People are so suspicious and deluded that
[when Merck announced the success of the molnupiravir trial](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/covid-misc/#molnupiravir-works),
people immediately dived down the intellectual rathole of speculation that molnupiravir is
just repackaged ivermectin (because Merck makes both, and ivermectin is a cheap generic,
thus less profitable).  

It was so bad, and so _immediate_, that _Reuters_ ran 2 Fact Checks on it, and
they're just not even remotely
similar. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> Ivermectin is
a macrolytic lactone derived from a bacterium, and acts on ion channels found in parasites
but not humans.  Molnupiravir is a nucleotide that's been messed with chemically so it
won't function properly, and operates by getting incorporated in the viral RNA as it
replicates so it hypermutates and can't function.  Not even _remotely_ similar!  

We've previously
[whinged a bit about ivermectin nonsense](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/lessons-covid/#lesson-1-why-are-all-the-ivermectin-studies-misdesigned-inconclusive-or-outright-fakes)
on this crummy little blog that nobody reads, but today we'll look at some more serious
takedowns from real clinical trials analyzed by people with real medical credentials.  

### And what does de-worming have to do with COVID-19?

Umm&hellip; I dunno.  Plumbing the depths of the right-wing disinformation sewer to find
the origin is something that will have to be done by somebody with a stronger stomach than
me.  I get angry too fast, because putting this sort of crap in people's head _kills
them_.  


## The recent Malaysian clinical trial  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-malay-mih.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-malay-mih-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Malaysian Ministry of Health: ivermectin is useless for COVID-19" title="Malaysian Ministry of Health: ivermectin is useless for COVID-19" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Earlier this month, the Ministry of Health in Malaysia released the results of a clinical
trial of ivermectin vs standard of care in COVID-19 
patients.  <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  (The US registry is 
[NCT04920942](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04920942), if you want to see _all_
the details.)  

Why Malaysia?  Because ivermectin is generic, and therefore _cheap_.  That
makes a huge difference in the developing world.  However, sensible people want to know if
ivermectin is _actually useful_, so they ran a trial.  

The summary is shown here:  
- _Design:_  
  - Population: 500 subjects, over age 50, some with co-morbidities.  So they're (properly) studying
    the population that most needs help.  
  - Mild to moderate COVID-19, began treatment within 1 week after onset of symptoms.  So
    they're (properly) looking for an early intervention to prevent serious disease or
    death.  
  - Randomly assigned ivermectin or standard of care.  So they're (properly) randomizing.
    (I _think:_ there are a lot of details to proper randomization which are left out of the
    summary.  But everything looks good on the surface.)  
- _Results:_  
  - 3x more adverse events in the ivermectin arm, the most common being severe diarrhea.
    (Bonus points for the diarrhea cartoon on the center right.)  
  - No difference in progression to severe disease (21.2% on ivm, 17.3% on SoC).  That
    gives a risk ratio of 1.29 _against_ ivermectin.  But the 95% confidence interval on
    the risk ratio is 0.82 &ndash; 2.02: since that interval includes 1 (i.e., the same
    risk in both arms), this is not significant.  
  - No difference in the time to severe stage either: 3.0 vs 2.9 days.  They quote a
    $p$-value, which I assume is a $t$-test of mean difference between the two groups, of 
	$p = 0.68$, which is wildly non-significant.   
  
So ivermectin had worse side-effects, didn't stop severe disease, and didn't even slow it
down.  That's damning enough, but there's more: they measured ICU admission, mechanical
ventilation, symptom recovery, blood parameters and chest x-ray resolution&hellip; and saw
no difference there, either.  

__Conclusion:__ Ivermectin is a _bad choice_ of COVID-19 therapeutic.  

  
## Taking stock of ivmmeta.com  

But apparently there _are_ studies that favor ivermectin.  Unfortunately, a lot of them
are misdesigned, misinterpreted, or just outright fraudulent.  A couple weeks ago 
[we favorably quoted](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/lessons-covid/#lesson-1-why-are-all-the-ivermectin-studies-misdesigned-inconclusive-or-outright-fakes)
the skeptical frustration of Ashish Jha, head of the Brown University School of Public
Health:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    So frustrating<br><br>

    Why do these &quot;mix-ups&quot; keep happening to Ivermectin studies?<br><br>

    I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a coincidence that so many of these studies
	highly touted on Twitter and Facebook end up getting retracted 
    <a href="https://t.co/0ulyE7pTA0">https://t.co/0ulyE7pTA0</a> 
  </p>&mdash; Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH (@ashishkjha) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashishkjha/status/1456988402000310277?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2021</a>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>

That was just one study.  At [ivmmeta.com](https://ivmmeta.com/), they've done a
meta-analysis (combining mulitple other studies to get better statistical significance) of
66 studies and found ivermectin is wonderful.  

Today, we read through a dissection of that meta-analysis by Scott Alexander Siskind, who
gets my award for Best Blogger Ever.  <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  Let's see what
Scott has to say, and maybe add on a few little bits of our own.  

### Weirdness \#1: Anomalous Anonymity  

The first thing he notes about ivmmeta is that it's big, it's detailed, it's
professional-looking&hellip; but it's anonymous.  Why would you perform thousands of work
hours like this, hoping to change the world of COVID-19 therapeutics, and not put your
name on it?  

It seems kind of trollish to me: if you hope to change the world for the better, you want
your name on it so you can claim credit; if you're just stirring up trouble with
disinformation, you want anonymity and plausible deniability.  

(Yes, _this_ blog is hemi-semi-demi-anonymous.  That's to repel annoyances.  And, of course,
because I'm not trying to make a dramatic splash that changes how everybody thinks.  I
want to examine how _I_ think, and talk it over with friends and the occasional passers-by
who somehow find their way to this crummy little blog that nobody reads.)  

### The forest plot

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-acx-1.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-acx-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="288" alt="ACX/ivmmeta: forest plot of 35 ivermectin studies" title="ACX/ivmmeta: forest plot of 35 ivermectin studies" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Scott starts off in the right place: the
[forest plot (a.k.a. "blobbogram")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_plot)
of 35 ivermectin studies, summarizing them:  
- Each line is a study.  
- The first numbers on the left are the Risk Ratio ($RR$: ratio of probability of the endpoint
  in ivermectin vs other arm) and its confidence limit.  You'd like to see $RR < 1$ to see
  a positive ivermectin effect.  
- The plot on the right shows the same sort of thing visually: $RR$ increases horizontally from
  the left ($RR < 1$) to the right ($RR > 1$).  The box shows you where the $RR$ estimate is, the
  size of the box indicates the number of patients, and the whiskers show the confidence
  interval.  
- For ivermectin to be successful, you'd like to see a lot of big green boxes all to the
  left, with confidence interval whiskers that don't reach up to 1 (the vertical gray
  line).  

And because that's what you see here, it needs investigating to see if it's real.  

### Weirdness \#2: Muddled Measures  

The meta-analysis is a bit screwy on a number of grounds, one of which is they use
different endpoints from different studies: death, hospitalization, recovery time, having
symptoms, ventilation, not being discharged from hospital&hellip; basically all over the
map!  What these guys did was pick the most dire outcome reported by each study, and tried
to combine them.  

You cannot combine different measures like this and expect to get anything but hash
at the other end.  

### Weirdness \#3: Insane Inclusion

Each of the studies has different criteria for who can be a subject, what to measure, what
counts as COVID-19, what counts as progress, and so on.  Normally in a meta-analysis, you
either (a) combine studies that do the same thing or at least similar things, or (b) you
use a more or less objective set of rules like 
[Cochrane GRADE](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current).  

The authors of ivmmeta.com do neither.  They just include whatever they want, and tell us
to trust their judgement because they've read all the studies carefully.  Given the amount
of fradulent studies on ivermectin, this makes _absolutely no sense whatsoever!_  

It introduces the potential for investigator bias that contaminates everything.  

### The long, hard grind  

Scott then went through each of the 35 studies, read the primary material, and found all
sorts of crap.  For example, some studies were actually fraudulent.  Some, once you got
the raw data, showed craziness: patients dying before the study started, groups of 4
patients repeatedly looking like the data was copy/pasted&hellip; basically enough to convince you
the study never happened at all.  At least 4 studies have been retracted
_because of data fraud._  

Scott has the stamina and guts to go through all the studies; I can't even fight my way
through more than half of his writeup.  It's just too depressing.  If it's not fraudlent,
it's incompetent.  If it's not incompetent, it's underpowered.  If it's not underpowered,
it's just mis-analyzed.  If it's not mis-analyzed, it wasn't randomized or blinded.  

Sometimes they reported numbers that _simply could not be the result_ from a patient
population they claimed.  Simple example: if you have 10 patients, there's no way you can
say 15% of them did something or other &ndash; 0.15 is not the result of any integer
fraction with a denominator of 10.  Is that incompetence, or fake data?  (And at this
point, does it _matter_ which?)  

Some of the studies even have treatment and control groups done at different times, which
means they were exposed to different strains of SARS-CoV-2 (Delta vs other)!  That is, not
to put to fine a point on it, utter madness.  Have they ever even _met_ a statistician?!  

Just a real mess.  

Between Scott's analysis and another by Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz, who investigated these for
fraud, they eliminated 18 out of 29 studies.  The eliminations were for fraud, for severe
preregistration violations (not saying what you're measuring in advance, but just going on
a fishing expedition), methodological blunders, and so on.  

### Weirdness \#4: Silly Significance  

Finding this much fraud and incompetence in one place would be enough for me to just throw
out _everything_.  That's because the rest have a pretty good chance of being fraudulent
or incompetent, just in a way I didn't find out.  But then, I'm a cranky old statistician.  

Scott is younger man who has more faith in humanity than me.  So he persisted.  After
removing 2/3 of the studies for incompetence or fraud, that cuts the forest plot down to
this:  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-acx-2.png" width="900" height="294" alt="ACX/ivmmeta: forest plot after removing 2/3 of studies for incompetence and fraud" title="ACX/ivmmeta: forest plot after removing 2/3 of studies for incompetence and fraud" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Sure, it _looks_ like there's lots of green boxes, favoring ivermectin.  But of the 11
studies, exactly _one study_ (Bukhari) has a 95% confidence interval that keeps the risk
ratio below 1.  All the others are marginal at best!  

Now, what's your feeling here?  When we have to dig deeply to throw out 2/3 of the studies
for incompetence or fraud, and of the remainder only 1 has robust enough statistical
significance to pass muster?  Doesn't it seem like maybe that significance is _an
accident_?  Why is it when trying to combine large numbers of studies in a meta-analysis,
before we even get to the "meta" part, we're _back down to one study?_  

If that doesn't smell bad to you, get your doc to check you for COVID-19 because you've
lost your sense of smell.  Sure, maybe the meta-analysis of all of them combined
might be significant, but at this point it had better be _really_ convincing.  (And the
fact that they already use different endpoints and inclusion criteria isn't helping.)  

You can fiddle about with the inclusion criteria, the outcome measures, and the
combination methods to get results from $p \sim 0.04$ to $p \sim 0.15$.  I.e., if you try
really hard to manipulate the questions you ask, you can get borderline statistical
significance (just below 0.05).  There's a name for this practice of fiddling around to find
the _post hoc_ question your data says is significant:
[$p$-_hacking_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging).  And it's a crime against
statistics.  

### Weirdness \#5: Wait, Worms?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-EurJnlInflamm-cite.jpg" width="400" height="93" alt="Riaz, et al.: worldwide incidence of 3 species of parasitic worms" title="Riaz, et al.: worldwide incidence of 3 species of parasitic worms" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-EurJnlInflamm.jpg" width="400" height="531" alt="Riaz, et al.: worldwide incidence of 3 species of parasitic worms" title="Riaz, et al.: worldwide incidence of 3 species of parasitic worms" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
But now the best part!  

Scott points out that the studies showing even just a _trend_ toward significance come from
countries with something in common: Mahmud from Bangladesh, Ravakirti from East India,
Lopez-Medina from Colombia, etc. all come from countries with a large amount of intestinal
parasitic worms.  The maps here are from the Riaz paper <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
that Scott cites.  

Recall that ivermectin is for de-worming animals and people.  

Basically:  
- Having intestinal worms makes everything worse, including COVID-19.  Ivermectin gets rid
  of those worms, so you'll do better _if you were already parasitized by worms to begin with._  
- Many of the treatments for COVID-19 involve anti-inflammatories, mostly corticosteroids
  like dexamethasone.  Those shut down some parts of the immune system that fight worms,
  letting the worms run riot in your gut while you're sick of COVID-19.  Worm
  hyperinfection alone can be fatal; imagine how much worse it is to have COVID-19 at the
  same time.  So again, ivermectin helps _if and only if you already have worms._  
- Worms have a variety of ways of turning down your immune system so they can parasitize
  you at their leisure; it's likely some of those also reduce vaccine efficacy and
  response to SARS-CoV2 infection.  Ivermectin makes vaccination or response to infection
  better, _provided you're being harassed by intestinal worms in the first place._  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-bitterman-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="247" alt="Bitterman: ivermectin risk ratio vs % of population at risk for worms" title="Bitterman: ivermectin risk ratio vs % of population at risk for worms" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The final nail in the coffin&hellip; well, let's be honest: it's really more of a railroad
spike, isn't it?  Avi Bitterman controlled the ivermectin results for percent of
population with _Strongyloides_ worm infestation and
[reported the result shown here](https://twitter.com/AviBittMD/status/1461076939192602628).  

The horizontal axis is the fraction of the population at risk for infestation by
_Strongyloides stercoralis_, a parasitic worm.  The vertical axis is the Risk Ratio for
all-causes mortality in an ivermectin COVID-19 trial, with low values being favorable to
ivermectin.  

Each gray circle is a study, diameter indicating the size.  Note this very, very
carefully: _all the studies reporting ivermectin effect were in regions at risk for worm infestations._


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Ivermectin is for worms.  If you have &ndash; or think you might have &ndash; worms, see
your doctor.  Ivermectin is one of several fine therapies for worms.  

Ivermectin is _not for COVID-19!_  
- For COVID-19 prevention, there's vaccination.  Really, that's your best bet.  Try to get
  Pfizer or Moderna if you can.  
- For COVID-19 treatment, there's fluvoxamine, dexamethasone, molnupiravir, and (soon)
  paxlovid.  All fine therapies if you get a breakthrough infection.

But your first step is getting vaccinated.  Here at Chez Weekend, we both got 3 doses of
mRNA vaccines.  


## Addendum 2021-Nov-19, later that evening: US FDA &amp; CDC extend boosters to all over 18 years old  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-stat-1.jpg" width="400" height="229" alt="STAT: FDA approves boosters for adults over 18" title="STAT: FDA approves boosters for adults over 18" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-stat-2.jpg" width="400" height="179" alt="STAT: CDC approves boosters for adults over 18" title="STAT: CDC approves boosters for adults over 18" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
And as of this afternoon, the US FDA's advisory committee has expanded the Emergency Use
Authorization for boosters of both Pfizer and Moderna to all persons over age 18 who are
more than 6 months past their initial 2 shots. <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> Acting FDA
Commissioner Woodcock then endorsed the decision, officially granting EUA for all-adult boosters.  

In a remarkable display of speed, the CDC's ACIP committee within hours voted 11 &ndash; 0 to
endorse that.  Then CDC Director Walensky immediately ratified their decision, adding the
policy to CDC medical practice guidelines. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  

So there ya go, it's a done deal in the US: boosters all around for adults, and kids 5
&ndash; 18 can get the first 2 shots in the series.  (Pediatric vaccines for ages 0 to 5
years are still in the pipeline.)  


## Addendum 2021-Nov-20: The media slowly catch up  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-19-ivermectin-takedowns-economist.jpg" width="329" height="828" alt="Economist: ivermectin only helps COVID-19 pts who already have worms" title="Economist: ivermectin only helps COVID-19 pts who already have worms" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Today we notice that _The Economist_ has noticed.  <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>  While
most of their article is behind the usual execrable paywall, the graphic indicates they've
found a preprint of Avi Bitterman on the result above.  That's&hellip; mildly impressive:
I haven't found Bitterman's preprint myself, yet.  So&hellip; good job, _Economist_?  

They're leading with a forest plot, in the usual way:  
- Each row is a clinical trial.  
- Trials with suspected fraud, which are _the majority of ivermectin studies_, have been
  excluded.  This _alone_ should make you deeply suspicious of the rest!  
- The circle represents the central estimate of the risk ratio between ivermectin arms and
  non-ivermectin arms of trials.  Basically it's the mean or median or something of the risk
  ratio.  
- The whiskers represent the 95% confidence interval.  
- You'd like to see both the central estimate and the upper confidence limit below 1 to
  believe there is solid evidence that ivermectin is beneficial.  
- They've separated the trials from countries with low _Strongyloides_ rates from those
  with higher rates; basically non-wormy vs wormy.  
  
The result shows that ivermectin does _nothing_ for COVID-19 patients who do not 
_already have a worm infestation._  

__Conclusion:__  
- You have worms?  Ivermectin is for you, COVID-19 or not.  
- You have COVID-19 but no worms?  Ivermectin is junk; get fluvoxamine or molnupiravir or
  paxlovid or monoclonal antibodies or dexamethasone or&hellip; something known to _work._  
- You weren't vaccinated?!  Remind me again: why is that?
