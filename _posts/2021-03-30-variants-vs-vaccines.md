SARS-CoV-2 is mutating, in increasingly dangerous ways.  Can we keep up with booster
vaccines for the variants, or even eliminate it once and for all?  

## SARS-CoV-2 virus variants  

You hear all sorts of things about SARS-CoV-2 variants, with funny names like "B.1.1.7",
and "B.1.351".  People just _refuse_ to learn what those names mean, and mostly don't even
pronounce them correctly (e.g., as though the periods weren't there and didn't mean
anything worthy of their attention &ndash; a quick look through the phylogenetic tree
below will explain _that_).  But dangerous variants are real: they're cropping up all over
the place.  From Public Health England, via an article in _The Economist_ of all places
<sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, comes a nice graphic showing the
[phylogenetic tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) of how the viruses
evolved from their ancestral viruses (2019 - 2021):  

![Economist: Public Health England's estimate of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-30-variants-vs-vaccines-variant-tree.jpg "Economist: Public Health England's estimate of SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree")

- The "A" series is the root of the tree, the strain that started the pandemic.  
- It soon carves off a "B" branch, where the D614G mutation becomes 'fixed': present in
  just about everything thenceforward, because it confers a transmission advantage on the
  virus.  ([Mutation notation:](http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Educ/NomMutID30067ES.html) 
  this means that at position 614 in the protein, replace the normally found amino acid D
  (aspartic acid) with G (glycine).  The 
  [amino acids all have single-letter codes](https://molbiol-tools.ca/Amino_acid_abbreviations.htm).)
- Also tracked are 2 specific mutations: E484K in red (increases resistance to antibodies)
  and N501Y in blue (increases transmission).  Both are bad news.  
- Note the variants that have _both_ the bad news mutations: B.1.351 (South Africa), P.1
  (Brazil), and sometimes B.1.1.7 (Britain).  _That's_ why you hear so much about these
  variants and not all the others, bad as the others may be: these guys are arming up to
  be more infective and evade immune response (natural or vaccine-induced).  
- Because everything has to have an abbreviation nowadays, lest we actually communicate in
  _words_ like our primitive ancestors, the variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1 are VoCs
  ("Variants of Concern").  It's more serious than it sounds.  

Why are the _so many variants?_  Actually, there are even more than the 38 variants shown
in the tree: something like 880 known so far, according to the legend in the lower right.
These are just the ones that have occurred frequently enough to be really, really
annoying.  

Initially, I thought there wouldn't be very many variants: any mutation in the spike
protein would probably make it bind less well to ACE2, and be competed away.  Stupid me:
nature found ways to bind to human ACE2 _even better_.  The virus is evolving away from
its bat origins and learning to specialize in predation on humans.  We should expect a
couple new, more-effective, mutations to flare up each month until we vaccinate
substantially everybody.  _We need to vaccinate faster than our current glacial pace, and
we need to do it world-wide, including the developing world!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-30-variants-vs-vaccines-bmj.jpg" width="400" height="236" alt="BMJ: E484K mutation is beginning of an escape mutation" title="BMJ: E484K mutation is beginning of an escape mutation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The current evidence, from the _BMJ_ news analysis <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> shown
here, is that the E484K variant requires much, much higher concentrations of antibodies to
stop it.  Vaccine efficacies are lowered (the currently still-experimental Novavax goes
down to 60%, but that's still comparable to your annual flu vaccine, i.e., good enough to
be very worthwhile).  
  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-30-variants-vs-vaccines-bbc.jpg" width="400" height="263" alt="BBC: 'Double mutant' variant in India" title="BBC: 'Double mutant' variant in India" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Just to convince you further, a BBC article <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> points out
that in India there is a new 'double mutant': E484Q and L452R.  The E484Q is similar to
the E484K, and is another way of enhancing immune evasion.  The L452R mutation is like the
"California variant" seen in the US, which is more transmissible.  

_Expect this to continue, until vaccination is near-universal.  This includes the
developing world, as the India example shows here._


## mRNA vaccines and boosters for variants

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-30-variants-vs-vaccines-pfizer.jpg" width="400" height="157" alt="Pfizer: Also working on booster &amp; variant booster" title="Pfizer: Also working on booster &amp; variant booster" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Fortunately, once you have an mRNA vaccine (and its lipid nanocapsule, and the
preservatives, and the infrastructure, and&hellip; "stuff"), it's relatively easy (i.e.,
difficult, but not skull-breakingly difficult) to replace the mRNA with a variant, or
possibly a mixture of variants.  The mRNA vaccines are sometimes called "digital" because
of this: you reprogram your mRNA synthesizers, fiddle with stabilization mutations and
such, and you can quickly get out a variant vaccine candidate.  

Moderna has already started this <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, especially for the
worrisome B.1.351 variant with immune escape potential.  Unsurprisingly, Pfizer &amp;
BioNTech have done so as well. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> If we assume something
like a March start date and a 6 month clinical trial, that means they would be
before the FDA in September.  


## What about the FDA?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-30-variants-vs-vaccines-nyt.jpg" width="400" height="276" alt="NYT: FDA will abbreviate testing for variant vaccines" title="NYT: FDA will abbreviate testing for variant vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-30-variants-vs-vaccines-reuters-fda.jpg" width="400" height="172" alt="Reuters: FDA rapid review of COVID-19 boosters" title="Reuters: FDA rapid review of COVID-19 boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Ok, "before the FDA".  Will there be a long delay there?  

Keep in mind, the usual FDA procedure is to throw out your conclusions, re-analyze your
data using the methods specified in the clinical trial protocol, compare their results
with yours, make a recommendation to an expert review committee, have the committe
meeting, and _then_ decide.  Normally this takes time.  The recent vaccine approvals have
been lightning-fast, in that they could execute all of that in just a few weeks.  

Will they continue that responsibly fast review?  All signs point to yes, as indicated by
these articles from the _NYT_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> and 
_Reuters_. <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  This means the trials required will not be
the monsters required the first time around, but rather more like the annual flu vaccine.
This is _completely appropriate_ for a vaccine whose general behavior is well understood,
and is being tweaked to accomodate viral variants (exactly the case for influenza).  

So that, at least, seems to be trending in the right direction.  If the variant
mini-trials read out in September, we might see variant booster vaccines available in
October.  Just in time for winter, like flu vaccines.  

## What about vaccine resistance?  

Yeah, what about the vaccine resisters?  They'll be the demented knuckleheads they've
always been.  Maybe more: yet another vaccine will almost certainly make them scream "I
told you so"&hellip; though exactly _what_ they allegedly told us will remain vague.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-30-variants-vs-vaccines-reuters-chip.jpg" width="400" height="196" alt="Reuters: vaccine does not microchip you, if you're dumb enough to ask" title="Reuters: vaccine does not microchip you, if you're dumb enough to ask" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
And the conspiracy theories will become more florid, almost psychotic.  For example,
consider the arrant nonsense that the COVID-19 vaccines will inject you with a 
microchip <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>, so that Bill Gates or George Soros or
_somebody_ will be able to&hellip; _something_.  

One enterprising vet has helpfully provided pictures of the hypodermic needles used to
[inject tracking chips into pets](https://www.avma.org/microchipping-animals-faq)
(such as happened to the Weekend Publisher; I rather imagine he did not approve of the
experience) vs the needles used for vaccinations.  The latter is a 22-25 gauge needle that
you can barely feel; the former is by comparison giant:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    For a bit more context: microchip needle on the left, vaccine needle in the right. 
    I promise you'd notice if the government were secretly microchipping you.

The social engineering question is: how do we stop people from filling their heads with
crap like this?  Clearly, whatever we've been doing so far isn't really working well enough!  

## The Weekend Prediction  

By fall 2021, there will almost certainly be problems with new variants, possibly even
beyond the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variants that bother us now.  Some of them may have
escape mutations, rendering previous vaccinations less useful (though not completely).
Consequently, there will almost certainly be booster vaccines as the final path to
eliminating COVID-19 as a pandemic.  We will be weary of it all, and some will be
suspicious of yet another vaccine for stupid reasons.  _But it will be important to take 
the booster and get it out to substantially all of humanity, or COVID-19 variants 
will never go away._  

Get the booster if &amp; when it comes.  

That's the answer to the question posed above, as to whether we can eliminate COVID-19
once and for all.  Yes, if we vaccinate _much faster_ and then get near-universal uptake
of a booster to account for the variants that will accumulate in the meantime.  Take a
look again at the phylogenetic tree above.  See that variant A.1 in the upper left corner?
It's labelled "extinct" in human.  That's what we want.  

If we do not do that&hellip; get ready for 'endemic COVID-19' that hangs around forever,
requiring a new vaccine every fall just like influenza.  

I prefer the future with SARS-CoV-2 extinct in human.  You should, too.

It appears there is some good news on the viral variants front: _Reuters_ is 
reporting <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> that in patients convalescent from "classic"
COVID, T cell responses to the new variants are still strong.  

Recall that immunology is, to say the least, complex.  We know that neutralizing antibody
responses from "classic" COVID are a bit weaker on some of the variants, particularly on
the South African variant B.1.351.  However, that's only part of the story.  We also want
to know how long memory B cells remember the infection, and how aggressively T cells will
hunt down and kill infected cells.  This latest result implies that a vigorous T cell
response against the new variants is present.  

In an example of somewhat useless journalism, that's all they say: no citation of the
research beyond mentioning the first author's name &amp; affiliation, Andrew Redd of
NIAID.  So I had to dig a bit, and found the NIH news 
release <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>, which fortunately had a bit more detail.

Among those details was the all-important pointer to the original 
paper <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>, whose conclusions we can now analyze a bit.  
- They took blood samples from _n_ = 30 patients, each PCR-confirmed to have had COVID-19
  and now convalescent.  This captures not just antibodies, but circulating immune cells.  
- They isolated PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) to get hold of some CD8+ T
  cells, one of the hunters who seek out and kill infected cells.  
- They tested T cell activity in a variety of complicated ways against the British variant
  (B.1.1.7), the South African variant (B.1.351) and the Brazilian variant (B.1.1.248).
  The latter is [related to the P.1 variant of concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineage_P.1)
  in some way I haven't entirely understood, but apparently it covers the case of P.1.  
- In each case, a strong T cell reaction against each viral variant was observed.  
- Note that these T cells were trained on "classic" COVID-19, so the cross-reactivity with
  the variants is good news: it means immunity from classic COVID-19 (and presumably the
  vaccines designed against it) is likely to persist against the variants.  
- Even though some of the mutations make neutralizing antibodies less likely to recognize
  the mutated spike protein, the T cells are apparently not fooled.  
- However, they sound a cautionary note: the exact levels of antibody and T cell response
  needed to confer immunity is not known, they just note that it's been observed.

So&hellip; that's good news.  I'm still an anxious, depressed, cranky old scientist
though: still betting (probability ~ 60%) that a booster will be necessary in the
fall of 2021.
