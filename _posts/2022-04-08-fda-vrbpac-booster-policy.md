This week the FDA'S Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC)
met to consider future policy for vaccine boosters and variants for the future.

We'll start out with our usual safari guides at _STAT News_, Andrew Joseph &amp; Matthew
Herper, who live-blogged the hearing. <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup>  They tell of
some of the expected arguments, i.e., "why are we here when you authorized boosters last
week?" (And, of course, when the sound cut out: "What's the point of having public VRBPAC
hearings if the public can't hear the discussions?"  Also, some nice kvetching about the
FDA's choice of hold music, which I found for some reason entirely amusing.)  

But of course real primacy must go to the primary sources, the FDA itself and the
presentations to the VRBPAC:  

- The meeting announcment page <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> contains a video feed for
  those who feel compelled to watch every detail, and links to all the briefing documents
  and slide decks.  
- The official briefing document, written by FDA staff, summarizes what's on their mind
  and the subjects on which they would like to take expert advice. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
  They summarized the issues thusly:  
  > While modification of a monovalent Covid-19 vaccine to be more closely aligned to a
  > specific variant may improve vaccine effectiveness against that variant, it is not
  > known whether such modification might come at a cost of reduced breadth of coverage
  > and potentially decreased effectiveness against variants that might emerge in the
  > future. Depending on the evolution of the virus and the epidemiology of circulating
  > variants, a multivalent vaccine &hellip; may offer benefit over a monovalent vaccine.  
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-questions.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-questions-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="VRBPAC questions on booster policy" title="VRBPAC questions on booster policy" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- The official questions the FDA put before the VRBPAC, shown here. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
  Note it says explicitly there are _no voting questions_ to be decided here, they just
  want to hear expert discussion on what future policy options they have.  (Though we, and
  they, decided to add: "How much international coordination is needed _vs_ going one's
  own way in an emergency?")  
- An FDA-authored presentation on the "framework for future decisions" on the 2 main
  issues here: when to authorize boosters, and what strain(s) to put in boosters
  (monovalent vs polyvalent like modern flu shots). <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  
- An FDA-authored proposal for particular decision procedures (committees and such) for
  vaccine strain composition. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  This is kind of a
  bureaucratic thing, but at least they're trying to get it out of the way in advance.  

That's the _ex officio_ FDA input to the meeting.  The external advisors, of course, had
much to say as well:  
- A presentation on SARS-CoV-2 viral evolution under population immune 
  pressure <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, because nothing is ever allowed to be simple
  and easy.  
- What appears to be a use of either singular value decomposition or multidimensional
  scaling to represent the angigen space in a way to call out differential antibody
  response. <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>
- A COVID-19 model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation @ University of
  Washington <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>, containing the most complicated SIR model
  I've seen to date (and yes, I've seen the SIDDARTHE model).  
- The star of the show, for my money, was an empirical study of the efficacy of a 4th dose
  in Israel. <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>  We'll look through some of the problems,
  but this is as close as you're gonna get to somebody telling you what's likely to happen
  with another booster, and is apparently what drove the FDA authorization for them.  
- Announcement of a WHO Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine 
  Composition <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>, the main innovation of which, as far as
  I could see, was the acronym WHO TAG-CO-VAC.  
- A CDC update on the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 strains. <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>  
- A CDC update on the vaccine efficacies. <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  
- A set of considerations on choosing booster strains, combinations, and timing based on
  manufacturing requirements. <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup> The main point here was
  that we can't wave a magic wand and decree _fiat boosters_; somebody has to make them
  (with all the supply chain problems) and then distribute them, warehouse them, make an
  adequate cold chain, educate healthcare providers, pay for them, and so on.  Not as
  interesting as the basic science, but any one of these can stop you cold, so it's nice
  to see at least _pro forma_ attention being paid.  
  
Lots of stuff to look through, so we'll look at the slides and the opinion of our safari
guides to see what's worth looking at.  


## The High Points  

### SARS-CoV-2 Evolution Under Population Immune Pressure

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-bedford-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-bedford-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="245" alt="Bedford @ Fred Hutchinson: Probability distribution for frequency of Omicron-like events" title="Bedford @ Fred Hutchinson: Probability distribution for frequency of Omicron-like events" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Trevor Bedford, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center &amp; Howard Huges Medical Institute,
had a summary of the evidence on SARS-CoV-2 evolution, as the human population becomes
more immune via vaccination and prior strain infections.  The high points, as I saw it,
were:  
- The data from [nextstrain.org](https://www.nextstrain.org/) shows SARS-CoV-2 mutation is
  extremely rapid and overwhelms previous strains.  A variant will drift for a while, but
  then get bigfoot-stomped by a new variant.  The first slide reproduced here shows the
  cladogram ("viral family tree") showing how Delta and Omicron are unrelated.  Below that
  we see the abundance in patient samples:  
  - Alpha was the big noise in early 2021  
  - Then Delta bigfoot-stomped it out of existence in midsummer 2021  
  - Then Omicron/BA.1 even-biggerfoot-stomped it out beginning late 2021  
  - &hellip; and now Omicron/BA.2 strain is biggest-foot-stomping even that.  
- We can compare this against various types of influenza, the previous record holder for
  serious human-infecting virus with annoyingly high mutation rates.  In all cases,
  they've plotted the number of amino acid (AA) substitutions per unit length in the spike
  protein for SARS-CoV2 and the equivalent for influenza.  At least 2 things stand out to
  me:  
  - The mutation rate in SARS-CoV2, ($18.5 \times 10^{-3}$ subs/AA/year), is about 2.5 -
    12.3 times _faster_ than influenza!  
  - In the upper left plot, the cloud of orange points at the top is Omicron: Omicron
    stood out as having a _monster_ number of mutations, over and above the already-high
    mutation rate in SARS-CoV-2!  
- Finally, with admittedly scant data, they estimated a Poisson distribution for the
  probability of getting a new Omicron-like event every so many years.  The median was 1.5
  years, and the (possibly 95% probability?) credible upper limit was 10.5 years.  So
  while there's a lot of uncertainty there, we should _plan for this happening again, every
  couple years._  Better to over-prepare and be wrong, than have another pandemic that
  kills another few million: public health, when successful, always looks like
  over-preparation.  

### COVID-19 Vaccine Efficacies  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-cdc-ve-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-cdc-ve-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Link-Gelles @ CDC: VE decline in Delta and Omicron" title="Link-Gelles @ CDC: VE decline in Delta and Omicron" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
LCDR Ruth Link-Gelles presented some sobering data on the _need_ for boosters, documenting
a decline in efficacy between Delta and Omicron that basically wipes out the primer
series.  

There's a lot here, but I've extracted just 1 slide showing all age group efficacies vs
infection for Delta and Omicron.  (There's other data on severe disease, hospitalization,
and death, with age stratifications.  This just a simple way to make the main point; the
other data back up against the usual objections.)  

__The point:__  
- Over time, VE for 2 doses declined against Delta somewhat (80% down to 60%).  
- That might have been enough to justify a booster, but check out what happened to
  Omicron: VE decined in 2 months down to _indistinguishable from 0%!_  
  
This is excellent evidence that 2 doses is just ineffective against Omicron, and the first
booster was an excellent choice in retrospect.  It doesn't say anything about a 2nd
booster, so we'll look at other data below for that.  

### Update on Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 Strains  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-cdc-epi-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-cdc-epi-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="244" alt="Scobie @ CDC: Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 strains over time" title="Scobie @ CDC: Epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 strains over time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-cdc-epi-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-cdc-epi-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="Scobie @ CDC: Prior infection vs time, stratified by age" title="Scobie @ CDC: Prior infection vs time, stratified by age" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-cdc-epi-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-cdc-epi-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="Scobie @ CDC: Case rates &amp; death rates, vax vs non-vax" title="Scobie @ CDC: Case rates &amp; death rates, vax vs non-vax" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
CDR Heather Scobie of the CDC presented a boatload of data on the epidemiology of
SARS-CoV-2 strains over time, as well as the case rates and death rates.  While there's a
lot here, I came away with 3 impressions:  
- In the 1st slide shown here, we see color-coded fractions of patients with each
  strain.  You can see that ast the start of 2021, Alpha (in blue) was on its way to
  dominance.  Then came the bigfoot-stomp of Delta (orange).  Then came the
  biggerfoot-stomp of Omicron (purple).  (These data cut off too soon to see
  Omicron/BA.2.)  This is in exact agreement with Bedford's data above.  
- They measured the fraction of people with nucleocapsid antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.  This
  means, roughly, "not spike protein antibodies" so we know it's _not_ from vaccination.
  This is a reasonable measure of who's had prior infections.  In the 2nd slide shown
  here, it's plotted versus teim, and stratified by age groups.
  - It's lower among the older cohorts, as we'd expect from (a) higher vaccination rates
    (less likely to have been infected) and (b) higher death rates (less likely to have
    been around for post-infection sampling).  This is&hellip; an unpleasant truth.  
  - More to the point, the cohort most likely to be carriers (the young) are rising over
    time.  If 50% of the young have had COVID-19 already, then it's that much harder for a
    new wave to start due to prior infection immunity.  This is&hellip; a rather more
    hopeful truth, that we're in
    [the burned-over district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burned-over_district) now 
    and thus not subject to further SARS-CoV-2 evangelization.  
- Finally, consider the 3rd slide here: case rates and death rates versus time, stratified
  by vax status (unvax, primary only, and boosted).  
  - The plot on the left shows that Omicron did indeed cause a fair number of breakthrough
    infections in the vaccinated, though nowhere _near_ the infections in the
    unvaccinated.  
  - Even more sadly, consider the death rates on the right: the vaxed, and especially the
    boosted, barely budged in their death rates.  The unvaxed death rate soared.  
  Omicron was a disaster for the unvaccinated, and _it did not need to happen!_  This is
  the fruit of the poison tree of vaccine disinformation: misery and death.  "Get
  vaccinated, or die" is more or less the message.  

### SARS-CoV-2 Antigenic Space  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-beigel-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-beigel-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="232" alt="Beigel @ NIAID: Antigenic cartography for strain selection" title="Beigel @ NIAID: Antigenic cartography for strain selection" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The Beigel study from NIAID was interesting, but frustrating.  

They're trying to use data to guide strain selection for the next vaccine booster, which
is of course an important problem and one of the reasons for this meeting.  In principle,
I like their method, which is apparently in use for influenza vaccines:  
- They measure the levels of antibodies required for neutralization of each strain, and
  calculate the distance from the highest strain.  Repeat this for each relevant type of
  antibody/vaccine/convalescent serum to get multiple types of distances.
- In principle, there's some high-dimensional space in which each strain is a point and
  the measured distances are the Euclidean distances.  They reduce this to 2 dimensions,
  but do not specifiy their method.  (The usual ones would be
  [multidimensional scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) or
  taking the first few factors in
  [singular value decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition).
  I've happily used both methods in the past, so I'm a bit frustrated at the math being so
  suppressed I can't see what's going on.  Although, the biologists and MDs would probably
  be allergic to the math, so as per usual, there may be no happy medium here.)  
- Then in the veritcal dimension they show the GMT (geometric mean titer required for
  neutralization), to get a surface.  The high parts of the surface are the danger zones,
  so you want to be sure you cover those.  
  
So _in principle_ I love this: it's a data-driven, quantitative method for strain
selection.  Unfortunately:  
- For math geeks like me, there are _no equations_ and _no statistical methods_ cited for
  the dimension reduction, or the significance of distances on the antigenic surface.  So
  it's hard to trust the method, and it didn't call out a clear conclusion anyway.  I say
  this sympathetically, because I've been there personally: too much math alienates all
  the biologists and executives, but too little alienates all the statisticians.  
- For the bio/med geeks on the VRBPAC, the conclusion was the same but the reasons were
  different.  They saw a lot of plots they couldn't interpret, began to shy away from the
  underlying math, and wanted to hear about T cells instead of antibodies anyway.  As our
  safari guides at _STAT News_ report:  
  > Unfortunately, as Harvard's Eric Rubin, an FDA panelist, noted, these figures are
  > "complex" and "very hard to judge." In a follow-up, Paul Offit, another FDA panelist
  > who works at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, noted that measures of T cells,
  > not antibody levels, might be a better correlate of protection for vaccine
  > efficacy. This is one time where it would be better if the answer wasn't "it's
  > complicated."  

It _looks_ like a promising method, but it needs craftier presentation for mixed audiences
and firmer, more actionable conclusions.  

### IHME COVID-19 Update  

The IHME group at Univ Washington showed off a _very_ elaborate 
[SIR model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology) and used
it to analyze immunity waning, past infection rates, omicron particulars, and to make a
forecast (hopefully titled "Why the end of the pandemic is near").  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="223" alt="IHME: Elaborate SIR models for COVID-19 immunity fading" title="IHME: Elaborate SIR models for COVID-19 immunity fading" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="IHME: Comparing model vs reality" title="IHME: Comparing model vs reality" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-3.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="IHME: Vaccine-derived vs infection-derived immunity" title="IHME: Vaccine-derived vs infection-derived immunity" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
SIR models are a subspecies of compartmental models, in which one divides the population
into "compartments" like __S__ usceptible, __I__ mmune, and __R__ ecovered.  The various
plausible state transitions are drawn in with arrows.  There's a (nonlinear) differential
equation for the time rate of change each state, with a coupling constant and the product
of compartment populations on the right-hand side for each arrow.  If there's vaccine
waning with time, then you get an integro-differential equation, as shown here.  

I've played with these a bit in the past. (Most recently, somewhat nervously in
March 2020.  It was a (minor) part of my decision to retire.)  They're a bit tricky: it's
tempting to add more state and arrows, but that adds more parameters and weird sensitivity
to initial conditions or parameter variation.  So I'm a bit taken aback by the complexity
of the model shown here:  
- 4 states (Susceptible, Exposed, Immune, and another flavor of Suceptible after fading
  immunity) for each of 3 populations (unvaccinated, vaccinated, and boosted).  
- So that's 12 states, then multiplied by the number of viral strains tracked: say 4 or
  so, for a total of around 48 states.  
- I didn't even try to count the arrows, of which there are many, but it's easily a 100
  parameter model.  How on earth can you estimate that?  
  
Still&hellip; it's a brave attempt and we should (skeptically) evaluate how it works on
historical data.  (Regrettably, we now have a couple years of COVID-19 data.)  

The second slide here shows, alas without math, the results integrating their model to
estimate vaccine efficacy versus time.  It's&hellip; not a tight fit, but&hellip; neither
is it utter nonsense.  I've no idea how the did the model parameter estimation, but it
seems to generate _relatively_ reasonable results.  

The third slide here seems out of place, but it's interesting:  
- The green matrix shows cross-immunity between strains.  The critical part is the
  rightmost column: Omicron confers Omicron immunity, but everything else is only about
  half as good.  So previous infection isn't that great.  
- The curves on the right show vaccine- and infection-derived immunity versus time.
  __NB:__ infection immunity fades _much_ faster.  (So get vaccinated.)  

They also did some fitting of their models to past data, the result of which seems to be
relatively non-absurd fits.  I didn't dive into all the details here, because (a) their
fits of VE waning convinced me the model, while complex, is not absurd, and (b) I'm more
interested in their forecast for the future anyway.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="IHME: Omicron invasion speed" title="IHME: Omicron invasion speed" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
There's a lot here about Omicron, but 2 things suffice:  
- The invasion speed, or the fraction of cases due to Omicron vs time shown here, is
  _amazing_ (and not in a good way).  The red curve here is the model's estimate for
  Omicron, while the black and blue curves are Delta and double-speed Delta, respectively.  
- Not reproduced here is a table of various vaccine efficacies vs various strains, showing
  that Omicron is worth taking very seriously, as we have found to our sorrow.  
  
These are not so much predictions about Omicron, as model validation showing the model
gives the same warnings we've encountered to our sorrow in reality.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-5.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-ihme-5.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="IHME: Death forecast in US" title="IHME: Death forecast in US" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Finally, the main act: their forecast.  Having shown the model is sensible, what does it
say about the future?  

Despite the grimness of the Omicron past, the future looks&hellip; sort of ok?!  Their
forecast of the death rate in the US goes down to near-normal, mostly due to exhaustion of
the susceptible population through vaccination or prior infection.  We could have done
better than that with aggressive vaccination mandates to save lives, but we chose to
"tough it out" instead.  It was indeed tough, but this (somewhat plausible?) model
predicts that "the end is near", this time in a good sense.  

Immunity won't last, of course, so we'l have to manage this chronically, perhaps forever.
And there will be blow-back of new variants both from wild animal populations as well as
the very human population in the developing world who are not yet vaccinated.  

The IHME conclusion:  

> End of omicron wave will leave world with highest levels of immunity
> since the beginning of the pandemic. But immunity will wane.  

I liked this talk!  It was nicely mathematical, they showed they could credibly estimate
the required parameters, they tested it on past data in a couple ways showing
plausibility, and they made a definite prediction about the future.  (Of course, it was a
prediction I _liked_, so I should be suspicious of my judgement there.)  

### Protection by 4th Dose of BNT162b2 Against Omicron in Israel  

The main act: the Israeli data on 2nd boosters from our now old friends, Alroy-Preis and
Milo.  They have ridiculously elite affiliations, with the Israeli Ministry of Health, the
Weizmann Institute, the Technion, the Gertner Institute, and Hebrew University.  Basically
all the big, high-prestige institutions in Israel, which mean their opening slide was
decorated with a hilarious number of high-prestige logos.  

But on to the actual science.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-israel-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-08-fda-vrbpac-booster-policy-israel-1.jpg" width="400" height="216" alt="Israeli data: rate of uptake of 2nd boosters" title="Israeli data: rate of uptake of 2nd boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Because Israel, unlike the US, has actual universal health care and a unified electronic
medical records system, they can take a broad look at the whole population.  Hence we have
here a "natural experiment": 
- 1.2 million people were eligible (age &gt; 60 or medical staff, whose 3rd dose was &gt;
  4 months ago.  
- About half chose to take a 4th dose, and half did not.  As the time graph shows, the 4th
  dose cohort was exteremely rapid in uptake: about 3 weeks from start to saturation.  
  
This is nice (600k people in each arm!), but of course it introduces problems from not
being randomized.  Perhaps the population taking the 4th dose was just medically more
cautious, or took more COVID-19 precautions generally?  That would mess up the result, and
in a way we cannot resolve.  

Other ways to be messed up have happened to Israeli "natural experiments" before, such as
[last year's exercise with Simpson's paradox we wrote about last August]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-simpson/).
Unsurprisingly, having been bitten by that, they've been _extremely_ careful on each
subsequent occasion.  And so it is here: they mention about a half dozen times they've

It would be _nicer_ if they gave the details, but that's in
[the preprint of their paper](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.01.22270232v1)
and not in these summary slides.  Since I haven't read the preprint, I won't complain
further about not seeing the quasi-Poisson regression.  

The bottom line on confounding factors seems to be that due to the volunteer effect, we
can't rule out bias that more careful people got second boosted and that would exaggerate
the effect.  Other biases were considered carefully, and we can spot them some credit that
another iteration of Simpson's paradox is _not_ going to be a problem here.

The results look pretty good!  What's shown here is the risk ratio for serious disease:
3-dose cohort / 4-dose cohort.  

Recall that we expect this term, like the vaccine efficacy, to be
[distributed by a Gauss hypergeometric function ${}\_{2}F\_{1}()$]({{ site.baseurl }}/beta-ratios/).
However, pretty much everybody uses a simpler binomial confidence interval to calculate
confidence limits on such a risk ratio.  We'd like to see the 95% confidence interval
bounded above 1 to believe that the risk is higher for 3-dose then 4-dose people.  It
certainly looks like that, building to more or less equilibrium by 4 weeks.  The error
bars get a bit larger after that (the whole cohort didn't get to week 9 by the time of
readout), so it's hard to say if there's a waning effect or not&hellip; but maybe not?  

Milo said the consensus was they bought another 2-fold to 4-fold further protection
against mortality with the 2nd boosters.  

So, yeah: 2nd boosters for people over 60 seem to work.  Your humble Weekend Editor
[got second-boosted last week]({{ site.baseurl }}today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time/), so I'm 
looking forward to increased safety in the presence of Omicron.  

You'd think, since I said this was "the main act", there would be more to say.  There's
more in their slides (population characteristics, myocarditis/pericarditis risk, and so
on).  But mostly it says things were ok and the 2nd boost worked.  

## Conclusions From Our Safari Guides  

Ok, that's a lot of data.  But it all pulls in more or less similar directions:  
- It's hard to decide timing, strain match, multivalent vs monovalent.  
- But so far, each booster has been a good strategy against Delta, and now against
  Omicron.  
  
Our safari guides report from the discussion that the VRBPAC would like to see:

All very reasonable, but also perhaps a product of the fact that this meeting had no
voting issues and hence nothing to decide definitively, just advice for the future to the
FDA.  So _of course_ they want more data.  

So is it boosters forever?  Probably not:

And as far as variant boosters, like the Omicron vaccines currently under development,
apparently there's a high bar for that:

## The Weekend Conclusion  

Honestly, I dunno what to think after all that.  On the one hand, the strain selection,
timing, and polyvalent vs monovalent problems are daunting.  On the other hand, the
empirical evidence is that the boosters so far have worked well and been well timed mostly
due to luck.  

Luck is not a strategy.  

I hope we get our vaccine booster, composition, and timing policies ironed out soon, while
the adults are still nominally in charge in Washington.
