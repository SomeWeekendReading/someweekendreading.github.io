Apparently, by longstanding lore and custom, today is Superb Owl Sunday.  How, exactly,
should one celebrate this?  


## How to Celebrate  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-09-superb-owl-sunday-greek.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-09-superb-owl-sunday-greek-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="505" alt="Ancient Greeks celebrated Superb Owl Sunday, too!" title="Ancient Greeks celebrated Superb Owl Sunday, too!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Easy: find a superb owl, then admire it.  

Here, for example, is how superb owls were celebrated in ancient Greece.  This pottery,
now in the Mus&eacute;e du Louvre in Paris <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, dates from
about the 5th century BCE.  It shows an owl in combat, using what appear to be
[hoplite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplite) arms and armor to attack an olive branch
(which is difficult to see in this photo, but check the references for other views).  

Or, it seems to me, it could be a whimsical depiction of Athena.  She's often depicted
in her r&ocirc;le as a warrior goddess with spear &amp; helmet, and her totem animal is
the owl for wisdom.  

Just admire it, and move on.  

You have now celebrated Superb Owl Sunday.  You need not trouble yourself with any further
ceremony on the subject.
