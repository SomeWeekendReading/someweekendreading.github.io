A few years ago, someone formally queried the government of Wales about alleged UFO sightings around
Cardiff Airport.  Apparently, this struck a nerve.  


## Call &amp; Response  

One of the opposition members of the Welsh Senned is Mr Darren Millar, the "Shadow Health
Minister".  In parliamentary systems, this means he's not _really_ the Health Minister,
but sort of in training just in case his party ever gains power.  So far, so good.  

The intrepid Mr Millar asked some questions of the government <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
apparently in a legally formal way which compels a response.  Basically: what is the
government's official position on the UFOs around Cardiff Airport, how many reports have
there been, how has the Ministry of Defence responded over the last 5 years, and will the
government fund research into this?  

In other words, just a troublemaker of a question with nothing serious behind it.  

However, apparently a response was required.  The Welsh government is also required to
respond bilingually in English and Welsh.  However, this time they elected a trilingual
response, in part:  

> jang vIDa je due luq.  ach ghotvam'e' QI'yaH devolve qaS.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-01-06-welsh-ufo-klingon.jpg" width="400" height="185" alt="BBC article: Welsh government responds to queries about UFOs&hellip; in Klingon" title="BBC article: Welsh government responds to queries about UFOs&hellip; in Klingon" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
No doubt we all recognize this as a snippet in the 
[Klingon language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klingon_language), a
[conlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language) constructed by linguist 
[Marc Okrand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Okrand) for use in the _Star Trek_
franchise.  

Loosely translated:  

> The minister will reply in due course. However this is a non-devolved matter.  

"Non-devolved" in this context means a power retained in Westminster by the British
government, not something in the immediate remit of the Welsh government.  

This is, somewhat unsurprisingly, the first time the Welsh government has communicated in
Klingon.  

The intrepid Mr Millar responded:  

> I've always suspected that Labour ministers came from another planet. This response
> confirms it.  

&hellip; which is about what one would expect!  


## The Weekend Conclusion

Oddly, this is not the first time on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR)
that we've had to take note of Welsh government Ministers behaving&hellip; _oddly._  Back
in early 2021, we noted <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> a death-wish policy that spread
vaccines out over the month until the next delivery, rather than just getting them into
arms as soon as possible.  

I like this more recent little jape much better, as nobody will die from hearing a
sentence of Klingon in response to a dumbfoundingly stupid question.  One might even say
it offers the precise amount of respect the question deserves.  

As you can see here, the Weekend Publisher &amp; Assistant Weekend Publisher agree.  They
are devoting their attention to far more important matters.
