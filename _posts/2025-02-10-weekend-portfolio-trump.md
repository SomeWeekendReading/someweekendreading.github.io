In the wake of a [revenant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenant) Trump and the
resulting generally deranged policies, we've decided to alter our retirement investments.  


## The Ground Rules Have Not Changed  

Previously,
[in mid-2021 we showed our retirement portfolio and its rationalization]({{ site.baseurl }}/retirement-portfolio/).
The idea was to make a portfolio of index funds that we could hold pretty much
indefinitely.  

The ground rules were:  

> - Use diversified mutual funds or ETFs, never try to pick stocks or bonds yourself.  
> - Always use index funds.  Active management is of negative value.  
> - Use _cheap_ index funds, i.e., low expense ratios.  In the past this meant
>   [Vanguard](https://www.vanguard.com), though there is some competition now.  Vanguard is
>   basically organized as a non-profit, unlike everybody else.  I've been
>   using Vanguard since about 1979 and like them.  
> - Use _sensible_ asset classes: US total stock market index, foreign total stock market
>   index, REIT index, Treasury/TIPS index of short-intermediate term, tilts to small and
>   value stocks, and foreign bond index. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  
> 
> [Peter Bernstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._Bernstein) wrote a famous article
> in 2002 about the virtues of a 60% stock / 40% bond portfolio.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
> While I won't go so far as he did and recommend it to _everybody all the time_, it's
> nonetheless what I probably want in early retirement.  
> 
> We want to maintain international diversification too.  The US is about 55% of the world
> stock market, so an unbiased portfolio would have a US/foreign ratio of 55/45.  We achieve
> that partly through using
> [VTWAX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTWAX), the world stock index
> fund, equivalent to the ETF [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/vt).
> 
> We also want to diversify across the value and size factors, so we include tilts in the
> stock portion to REITs (value-ish), US small value stocks, and foreign small stocks.  


## The Risks Have Changed  

That's pretty much where we still are: index funds, broadly diversified over investment
instruments (stocks/bonds/real estate), capitalizations (large/small), valuations
(growth/value), and nations.  

So why change?  

Because the risks have changed drastically!  

Our portfolio was perfectly adequate for a _very_ wide variety of circumstances.  But the
present circumstances are driven by Republican lunatics, pursuing self-destructive
policies of personal revenge and venomous racism.  Clearly, we need to be more defensive,
at the very least!  

However, we'll try to keep in mind a dictum of
[Jack Bogle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_C._Bogle) on the subject of adjusting
asset allocation to respond to the world: "If you must sin, then sin just a
little." <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  So we'll adjust our asset allocation in the
correct direction, but not drastically.  

By "in the correct direction", we mean:  
- Slightly less emphasis on stocks, as in a lower stock/bond ratio.  
- Slightly less emphasis on the United States, as in both:  
  - more foreign stocks, and  
  - more foreign bonds (with a currency hedge applied to the bonds, as per above).  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-10-weekend-portfolio-ratios.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-10-weekend-portfolio-ratios-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="97" alt="Stock/Bond and US/Foreign ratios in the global capital markets, compared to our portfolios" title="Stock/Bond and US/Foreign ratios in the global capital markets, compared to our portfolios" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
For comparison, here are the ratios for our old portfolio, world markets, and our new
portfolio.  
- In the first row, we've gone from a very conventional 60/40 stock/bond ratio to a
  slightly more conservative 50/50 ratio.  It's still not as conservative as world capital
  markets, which according to MSCI <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, are dominated by
  bonds at 45/55.  So even our new defensive position is more aggressive than world
  markets as a whole.  
- In the second row, we've gone from a 60/40 US/foreign stock ratio to a rather more
  international 50/50 ratio.  The world market position, according to 
  Morningstar <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, is about 55/45.  So we've gone from stocks
  with a slight tilt _toward_ the US to stocks with a slight tilt _away_ from the US.  
- The third row shows we've increased our foreign hedged bond allocation from about 25% of
  bonds to about 33% of bonds.  According to Vanguard <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>,
  the world markets are even more aggressively weighted to foreign bonds at about 67%.  

So we're making some changes, both away from stocks and away from the US.  But they're not
_drastic_ changes, in accordance with Bogle's dictum above.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-10-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-msci-global-portfolio-regions.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-10-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-msci-global-portfolio-regions-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="241" alt="MSCI: Global investable portolio by region" title="MSCI: Global investable portolio by region" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Still, there's plenty of room to go further.  The pie chart shown here, from the same MSCI
source, shows the world investable portfolio (stocks/bonds/real estate that trade in a
reasonably liquid fashion), broken down by region at the end of 2023.  If we were to take
our market indexing principles _very_ seriously, we might conclude that
_no more than 45% of assets should be invested in the US._  

We are, however, willing to invoke pragmatism: we live in the US, we earn in the US, we
pay taxes in the US, and we spend in the US.  A certain amount of home market bias is
excusable.  

What's not excusable is letting home market bias bind us to unique home market risks
imposed by Republicans.  We're getting slightly more defensive because of that.  


## The Results   

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-19-retirement-portfolio-table.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Asset allocation table for the Weekend Retirement Portfolio" title="Asset allocation table for the Weekend Retirement Portfolio" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Here's what the old portfolio looked like, which we've held since around 2020 (before
that, during the accumulation years we held a similar but more aggressive version with less bonds):  
- 60/40 stock/bond ratio  
- 60/40 US/foreign stock ratio  
- 60/40 total market/small-value tilts ratio  
- 75/25 US/foreign bond ratio.

In terms of tax placement, it's less in the tax-free Roth compartment than you'll see
below.  This is due to 2 factors:  
1. Relentless annual partial Roth conversions, in which we're gradually converting to a
   portfolio that will be largely immune to future tax rate changes (or at least
   reasonably diversified in that respect).  
2. The Trad IRA (tax deferred) is mostly bonds, while the Roth IRA (tax free) is mostly
   stocks.  We expected, and got, more growth in stocks than bonds.  So the Roth
   compartment grew quite a bit in comparison to the Trad compartment.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-10-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-asset-allocation.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-10-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-asset-allocation-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Detailed asset allocation to individual index funds" title="Detailed asset allocation to individual index funds" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here's what our revised portfolio looks like
[for comparison with our previous portfolio design]():
- The first column is the asset class, with colors going up the spectrum with risk from
  cash to stocks.  
- The second and third columns are the mutual fund names, both by ticker symbol and a
  short description of the asset class.  
  - All are index funds except for VAIPX, the intermediate TIPS fund.  It's technically
    active, but they way Vanguard runs it with low expenses, low turnover, and just
    covering the asset class it might as well be an index fund.  Honestly, I don't know
    why it's not an index fund, other than just history.  
- The fourth column gives the tax placement, either:  
  - a regular taxable account (taxed at capital gains rates upon sales), or 
  - a tax-deferred Trad IRA (taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal), or 
  - a tax-free Roth IRA (taxes already paid, never to be taxed again).  Obviously this category is
    very desirable, and we've been doing (a) annual conversions, and (b) putting the most
    high-growth assets in this account.  
- The fifth and sixth column give the asset allocation in terms of general investment
  class, and sub-asset allocation in terms of individual mutual funds.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-10-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-pies.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-02-10-weekend-portfolio-trump-2-pies-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="331" alt="Pie chart of new asset allocation" title="Pie chart of new asset allocation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The pie charts show some of the same information, but in graphical form:  
- Our tax placement is getting increasingly favorable, with almost 50% of assets now
  completely shielded from taxes in the Roth account.  The idea is to keep doing this up
  until the age of Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from the Trad account, so we
  won't be forced to recognize too much taxable income when that happens.  
- Obviously we have a 50/50 stock/bond ratio, and a 50/50 US/foreign stock ratio.  (The
  US/foreign bond ratio does not appear in this plot; perhaps it should?)  

The US/foreign real estate allocation (REITs) are obviously 50/50 US/foreign.  

In order to verify the US/foreign stock ratio, some extra information is required:  
- VTCLX and VTMSX are 100% US stocks, 0% foreign.  
- VTIAX is 0% US stocks, 100% foreign stocks.  
- VTWAX is (as of 2024-Dec-31) 63.58% US stocks, 36.42% foreign stocks.  

So the domestic and foreign stock allocations are:  

$$
\left\{
  \begin{align*}
    \mbox{VTCLX} + \mbox{VTMSX} + 0.6358 \cdot \mbox{VTWAX}    &= 5.98\% + 6.38\% + 0.6358 \cdot 1.78\% \\
                                                               &= 13.492\% \\
    \mbox{VITIAX1} + \mbox{VTIAX2} + 0.3642 \cdot \mbox{VTWAX} &= 8.34 \% + 4.51\% + 0.3642 \cdot 1.78\% \\
                                                               &= 13.498\%
  \end{align*}
\right.
$$

So, since those are substantially equal, our US/foreign allocation is indeed what we think
it is at 50/50.  

<!--
domestic total market allocation = equity    * not REIT  * TotMkt * not foreign
                                 = (1-$B$20) * (1-$B$22) * $B$B24 * (1-$B$23)
                                 = $I$11 * (1-$B$23)
                 = VTCLXt + VTMSXt + $B$27*VTWAX

foreign total market allocation = equity    * not REIT  * TotMkt * foreign
                                = (1-$B$20) * (1-$B$22) * $B$B24 * $B$23
                                = $I$11 * $B$23
                = VTIAXt + VTIAX + (1-$B$27)*VTWAX

The taxable funds are constants: VTCLXt, VTMSXt, and VTIAXt
There are 2 equations in 2 unknowns, VTIAX and VTWAX:

VTCLXt + VTMSXt + $B$27*VTWAX    = $I$11 * (1-$B$23)
VTIAXt + VTIAX + (1-$B$27)*VTWAX = $I$11 * $B$23

Solve first one for VTWAX:
VTWAX = ($I$11 * (1-$B$23) - VTCLXt - VTMSXt) / $B$27

Use that to solve second one for VTIAX: 
VTIAX = $I$11 * $B$23 - VTIAXt - (1 - $B$27)*VTWAX
-->


## The Weekend Conclusion  

This is not investment advice; it's just a summary of what we're doing Chez Weekend.  

The world is terrible.  But as all the existentialists have said, "Nevertheless, here we
are."  We have to cope with what is in front of us.  

For investments, that means becoming somewhat more defensive.  Politically &amp;
practically, it means becoming as difficult as possible, throwing sand in all the gears of
Republican fascism.  

At my age, I can do the former, but will have to choose carefully about the latter.  

As must we all.

<a id="fn1">1</a>: Vanguard's foreign bond index fund [VTABX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTABX) is currency-hedged back to the dollar, so it has no currency risk.  It's largely sovereign bonds of developed nations, so it looks like Treasuries.  Vanguard always recommends it.  

The last time I looked, Vanguard's evidence said it wouldn't help diversification much&hellip; but wouldn't hurt either.  (See [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/icrifi_032012_high.pdf), Figure 7 on p.10: note the broad, shallow "optimum" where the portfolio variance changes by only 0.2% as the foreign bond allocation goes from 0% to 100%!)
