Today I got shot a third time!  No, not a COVID-19 booster (though that's getting pretty
interesting, but its time is not yet).  Today I got the first of 2 doses of the
formerly-scarce Shingrix vaccine against shingles.  


## What's shingles?  

The childhood disease of [chickenpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox) is a
viral infection from a little beast called
[varicella zoster virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus), 
a form of herpes virus also known as human alphaherpesvirus 3 (HHV-3).  That's bad enough
that every kid should get the vaccine, which has been around since 1995.  

The evil little virus then goes dormant in your body, lying in wait for _decades_.  When
you get old enough, it can flare up again.  Not as chickenpox, but as a direct
inflammation of nerves, severely painful, called
[postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postherpetic_neuralgia).
It's so painful as to be disabling.  The word neuralgia should be scary: "neuro"
means involving the nerves or nervous system and "algia" means pain &mdash; it's directly
inflicting pain through stimulating nerves.  For _years._  Sometimes it occurs in the eyes
and causes blindness.  

That is the nasty thing called [shingles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles).  

But am I actually at risk for it?  I'm too old to have gotten the chickenpox vaccine,
which came out when I was 40 years old.  I don't remember having chickenpox.  However, the
epidemiology says that 95% of adults in the US have had chicken pox <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
apparently based on detecting dormant virus in their bodies.  

So, yeah, everybody's at risk for it.  I would like to avoid it.  


## Shingles vaccines  

Fortunately, there are vaccines.  And in these pandemic days, we all know vaccines are
good, right?  C'mon, don't make me glare at you.  Right?  

Right.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-29-today-i-got-shot-a-third-time-zostavax.jpg" width="250" height="140" alt="Zostavax pack shot" title="Zostavax pack shot" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
So some years ago, I had Zostavax, a shingles vaccine from Merck.  It was all that was
available then, when I turned 60.  It's got a vaccine efficacy of 50%
&ndash; 60% <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, which back in those days was considered
pretty good.  

Recall that vaccine efficacy is given by:  

$$
\mbox{efficacy} = 100.0 * \left( 1 - \frac{\Pr(\mbox{infection} | \mbox{vax})}{\Pr(\mbox{infection} | \mbox{non-vax})} \right)
$$

So an efficacy of 50% &ndash; 60% means that, by getting vaccinated, you have 50% &ndash;
60% less risk than the unvaccinated population.  (This is about the efficacy range of a
flu vaccine, and those are certainly worthwhile.)  It's not dramatic, but it's worth it
given how safe the vaccine is and how painful and sometimes disabling shingles is.  At the
time, the FDA recommended it to people over 60.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-29-today-i-got-shot-a-third-time-shingrix.jpg" width="222" height="166" alt="Shingrix pack shot" title="Shingrix pack shot" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
But then along came, from GSK, a bright shiny new recombinant vaccine called 
Shingrix.  In adults aged 50 &ndash; 69, such as your
humble Weekend Editor, it has a stunning efficacy of 97% in preventing shingles. 
<sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  That's actually _better_ than the 95% efficacy for the
mRNA COVID-19 vaccines about which we gushed so enthusiastically earlier this year.  

What's more, it's even recommended for persons who have previously received Zostavax.  

So&hellip; want some of that!  


## The problem  

It's a 2-dose series, with the 2nd dose 2 to 6 months after the first.  

Unfortunately, in recent years it's been in short supply and people actually had trouble
getting the 2nd dose in time.  For the last 3 years, I've asked my doctor about it at each
annual checkup.  Since they reserve the second dose at the time they give you the first,
they're being _absolutely certain_ the second dose will be available to you.  

Unfortunately, that means they're often out of it: all doses in their freezers are spoken
for by somebody who's already gotten the first dose.  

So for 3 years, I waited, hoping each time to get Shingrix.  For whatever reason, maybe
people putting off health care during the pandemic, there's plenty of it now.  So I could
just waltz into my local drug store, say I wanted Shingrix, fill out a few forms, pay $25
bucks, show them my Medicare Part D card, and get jabbed by a very pleasant woman in the
pharmacy.  

So I hope it's still available in 2 to 6 months!  

(Oh, and the Weekend Editrix lucked out: she got both doses of Shingrix earlier this year,
while we were all waiting for COVID-19 vaccine availability.)  


## Expected side effects  

The usual: sore arm, fatigue, headache, body ache, and so on.  It goes away in 1-3 days,
so nothing to worry about.  It's a little more severe than a reaction to a flu shot, but
way, _way_ less severe than shingles.  

The Weekend Editrix took a couple days off to lie on the couch with her iPad when she got
hers earlier this year.  I may do that.  _Happily._
