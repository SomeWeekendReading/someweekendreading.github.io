One of the (few) advantages to having been steeped in old books during youth is you begin
to realize how often we do the same dumb stuff, over and over, for _centuries._ This seems
to be especially true in law, politics, economics, and war.  


## Ukraine: In the wake of the Russians  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-05-25-tacitus-ukraine-pz-1.jpg" width="400" height="116" alt="PZ @ Pharyngula: State of Ukraine (and Russia itself)" title="PZ @ Pharyngula: State of Ukraine (and Russia itself)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Via [PZ @ Pharyngula](https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2023/05/25/hows-that-war-in-ukraine-going-anyway/) <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
comes a snarky-but-thoughtful essay on what the effect of Russian conquest has been on
civilian infrastructure in Ukraine.  

Summary: it's very, very bad.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-05-25-tacitus-ukraine-wapo-1.jpg" width="400" height="132" alt="Ilyushina @ WaPo: Prigozhin says war has backfired, possible Russian revolution" title="Ilyushina @ WaPo: Prigozhin says war has backfired, possible Russian revolution" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Of particular interest, though, was a link to a _WaPo_ article <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> that
tells us all is not entirely well back in Russia, either.  

But first, consider the sources:  
- Ilyushina is working off an interview done by Konstantin Dolgov, a "political operative
  and pro-war blogger" in Russia.  
- Dolgov, in turn, was interviewing [Yevgeniy Prigozhin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Prigozhin),
  an oligarch who is the leader of the notorious Wagner Group of mercenaries known for the
  most brutal tactics (e.g., "human waves" of convicts recruited from prisons without
  training) being used not just in Ukraine, but around the world.  

So between (1) journalistic interpretation, (2) war-blogger nonlinear amplification, (3)
dubious sourcing from a mercenary oligarch, and (4) the general tendency to say "hooray
for our side" in war, we should approach this with some considerable skepticism.  

Nevertheless, the report from Prigozhin is eye-popping: Russian internal turmoil could lead to a
revolution on the scale of the 1917 overthrow of the czar and the initial installation of
the communists.  

> "We are in a situation where __we can simply lose Russia__," Prigozhin said, using an
> expletive to hammer his point. "We must introduce __martial law__. We unfortunately &hellip;
> must announce __new waves of mobilization__; we must __put everyone who is capable to work on
> increasing the production of ammunition__," he said. "Russia needs to __live like North
> Korea__ for a few years, so to say, close the borders &hellip; and work hard."  

That is ever the demand of those who become billionaires by war: clamp down on civil
society, impose martial law, draft everybody, and devote all economic production to
weapons.  The "live like North Korea" bit is particularly chilling.

Indeed, it appears that native-Russian militias have been active in Belgorod over the last
3 days.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> This is particularly concerning as there is
apparently a nuclear weapon storage depot there, whose capture by anti-Putin rebels would
cause&hellip; _complications._  


## An historical perspective  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-05-25-tacitus-ukraine-bakhmut-destroyed.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-05-25-tacitus-ukraine-bakhmut-destroyed-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="238" alt="Bakhmut, after Russian conquest" title="Bakhmut, after Russian conquest" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here's a picture which, it is claimed, is an aerial view of the city of Bakhmut, which has
been the center of Ukrainian defense against Russian attack for some months now.  Russia
claims to have conquered all of it; Ukraine demurs.  Wagner Group mercenaries are
withdrawing, leaving Russian regulars to defend and keep the territory.  

Now, look at that picture.  These appear to be apartment blocks, office buildings,
schools, hospitals, caf&eacute;s, and that sort of thing.  In other words: _civilian infrastructure_,
not military targets.  The Russians have become justly infamous for attacking schools,
concert halls, art galleries, apartment blocks, and churches.  Given the availability of
precision weapons to Russia, this is not an accident: destruction of power plants, water
processing, dams, housing, and such are a matter of _Russian policy._  (This particular
policy is also a war crime.)  

I can't help but think (no, really: I _can't help_ but think about this!) of some of the tags of
Latin that were hammered into my skull at an age when I was too young to defend myself adequately:  

> &hellip; ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant. (&hellip; where they make a desert,
> they call it peace.)  
>  
> &ndash; Tacitus, [__De vita et moribus Iulii Agricola__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricola_(book)), [close of Chapter 30](https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/De_vita_et_moribus_Iulii_Agricolae#XXX:~:text=ubi%20solitudinem%20faciunt%2C%20pacem%20appellant.). (This particular English translation is my own, but it should be utterly uncontroversial.)  

I mean, it certainly _looks_ applicable, doesn't it?  We started with Bakhmut being a
thriving provincial city (though one of no particular military or strategic value).  They
have left behind an uninhabited, smoking pile of rubble piled upon bodies, for which the
word "desert" seems reasonable.  

But a bit of historical context drives the point home even better!  
- This is a quote from a book by the Roman historian Tacitus, more formally known as
  [Publius Tacitus (or Gaius Cornelius Tacitus)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus).  
- He was writing a [hagiographic biography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricola_(book))
  of his father in law,
  [Gnaeus Iulius Agricola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnaeus_Julius_Agricola).  
- Agricola was a major-league Roman general, involved in the conquest of Brittania and the
  subsequent _not-quite_ conquest of [Scotland/Caledonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caledonia).
  That was pretty much anything north of the
  [Antonine Wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonine_Wall), between the modern-day
  [Firth of Clyde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Clyde) and
  [Firth of Forth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Forth).  
- Agricola was quoting [Calgacus, a Scottish chieftain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgacus),
  describing what it was like to be beaten in battle by the Romans (though the Romans
  never really managed to hold territory in the Scottish north).

Calgacus said, approximately, that the Romans come in, slaughter, rape, and steal everything.
Then they smash anything left and kill everybody.  Once they're standing atop a pile
of smoking rubble, they call _that_ peace.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-05-25-tacitus-ukraine-fasces.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-05-25-tacitus-ukraine-fasces-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="364" alt="Roman fasces" title="Roman fasces" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
There is much to admire in ancient Rome.  There is also, alas, much to despise.
These are, after all, the people who used the
[_fasces_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasces) to represent state power: the bundle of
rods for corporal punishment (caning/bastinado) and the axe for capital punishment
(beheading).  This is the source of the word "fascism", so Rome is best regarded
skeptically, especially today.  

Almost every source on this passage in Latin mentions that Calgacus is making a sarcastic
play on words, comparing to "peace given to the world" inscribed on many Roman medals.
I've looked long and hard, but have never seen such a medal, nor have I seen the
inscription in the original Latin.  (I would probably gloss it as "pax mundo donatur", but
I am an amateur in these matters.)  This makes me suspicious that it's a folk theorem of
classicists, but it's so good it's hard to resist.  

So there you have it: Russians running the fascist game plan as old as the Romans.  Smash
everything, kill everybody, then stand proudly atop the rubble amid the fumes, and declare it to
be success and "peace".  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-toro.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-toro-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="440" alt="Tom Toro @ New Yorker: Repeating history" title="Tom Toro @ New Yorker: Repeating history" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
We seem absolutely _determined_ not to learn from history.  

During the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, Republicans were absolutely determined to
repeat the mistakes of 1929-1930 that caused the Great Depression: fiscal austerity,
chopping federal spending, etc.  (Of course, that's what they _always_ advocate, in _all_
situations.  That, and tax cuts, but only for the rich.)  

Now, sadly, we seem determined not to learn the lessons of the 1940s: fascism is _bad._  

As the French journalist/novelist
[Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Karr noted](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/plus_%C3%A7a_change,_plus_c%27est_la_m%C3%AAme_chose)
in 1849:

> Plus &ccedil;a change, plus &ccedil;\'est la m&ecirc;me chose.  (The more things change,
> the more they are the same.)

## Addendum 2023-May-26  

Sources on Twitter, linked back to Dolgov's Telegram channel, say he has been fired from
his propaganda job with the Russian government:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/JuliaDavisNews/status/1661742464116604929"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-05-25-tacitus-ukraine-twitter-1.jpg" width="550" height="679" alt="Davis @ Twitter: Dolgove fired" title="Davis @ Twitter: Dolgove fired" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Prigozhin, however, continues.  

At least, until he ascends a tall building with openable windows, in a fit of nostalgia
for his boyhood defenestration lessons.  That seems to be the way of things in modern Russia.
