Today is a _good day:_ the FDA's external advisory committe passed the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine at 6:30pm EST.  

## VRBPAC committee meeting

[_STAT News_](https://www.statnews.com/) reports as of _now_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
that at 6:30pm, after a day of robust discussion, the FDA's external advisory committe
gave thumbs-up to the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.  The relevant committee in this
case is the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC).  The
vote was 17-4-1, i.e., overwhelmingly in favor, with one curious abstention.

The main question, and 2 discussion questions, posed to the committe by the FDA were:  
- Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the
  Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 16 years of
  age and older? (__NB:__ usually that would be 18 or older, which caused some
  discussion.)  
- Please discuss any gaps in plans described today and in the briefing documents for
  further evaluation of vaccine safety and effectiveness in populations who receive the
  Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine under an EUA.  
- Pfizer has proposed a plan for continuation of blinded, placebo-controlled follow-up in
  ongoing trials if the vaccine were made available under EUA. Please discuss Pfizer’s
  plan, including how loss of blinded, placebo-controlled follow-up in ongoing trials
  should be addressed. (__NB:__ this caused some discussion about the ethics of giving the
  placebo subjects the vaccine, which would shut off follow-up.)  

_This committee approval is not the final step; the committee's report is a
**recommendation** to the FDA, not a binding decision._ There are times in the past when
the FDA has chosen to disregard the opinion of external scientists &amp; medical
pracitioners, but it's pretty rare.  It's _highly likely_ that the FDA will issue very
soon a formal EUA for the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

It may take them a couple days to work through all the paperwork, get the authorizations
into the FDA computers, and so on &ndash; but in a situation like this lots of people
would be _happy_ to work through the weekend if it meant vaccinations could start on
Monday.  

So here at Chez Weekend, we're betting on Monday.  

## Formal scientific publication in the _NEJM_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-10-pfizer-vaccine-passes-vrbpack-review-NEJM.jpg" width="400" height="521" alt="NEJM: Phase 3 clinical trial publication" title="NEJM: Phase 3 clinical trial publication" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Eric Rubin, a VRBPAC member and an immunologist at Harvard's HT Chan School of Public
Health, co-wrote an (audio interview) editorial in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ this
morning <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> saying it was "impressive enough to hold up in
any conceivable analysis" (_quite_ a strong endorsement, thinks this grizzled old
statistian) and: "This is a triumph."  

Also, the Phase 3 trial report on clinical trial
[NCT04368728](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04368728) made it past peer review and 
was published this morning, also in the prestigious _NEJM_. 
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

It's a thing of beauty.  I do not say that lightly.  


## Issues that concerned VRBPAC members  

### Pediatric patients  

Apparently, there was discussion of including 16-17 year olds in the vaccination
population, instead of the usual 18+ age limit.  This triggered some discussion that the
vaccine has not had a pediatric trial (fair enough), nor has it had an early pediatric
trial (infants &amp; kids), nor on pregnant or lactating women (so-called "DART studies",
for "developmental and reproductive toxicity studies"), and so on.  All fair
enough, but not exactly on target for a vaccine for _everybody else_, especially when
apparently pediatric and pregnant trials are planned already.  

The pregnancy issue is a real one: health care workers are justifiably at the front of the
line for vaccination, 75% are women, and many are of child-bearing age.  There could be,
according to the CDC, about 330,000 health care workers pregant or lactating.  

The trial so far has had 153 participants ages 16-17, so we're not blind.  Young people
down to age 12 have been vaccinated for a follow-on study, but those weren't in the EUA.  

Apparently, some of the "no" votes were from members who wanted to exclude anybody under
18 from getting the vaccine in advance of pediatric trials, in an abundance of caution.  


### Crossover design  

The commitee wanted to get the subjects in the control arm vaccinated as soon as possible
(see "crossover design of clinical trials").  Pfizer pointed out that this would be
impractical: 44,000 patients would have to come for 2 more appointments, sign completely
new consent forms, and might even refuse (meaning there would be no follow-up data from
them).  

Basically, it would mess up the trial, and they are going to be vaccinated soon
with the rest of the popuation anyway.  


### Severe allergies  

Some people just have severe reactions to vaccines.  If we know that about a patient, then
they should be required to site around for 45min or so under observation by a nurse with
an epi-pen, or something like that.  

Pfizer did happily note, though, that they had only 1 severe COVID-19 case (due to brief
drop in blood O2 levels) in the treatment arm.  


### Conspiracy theories  

There were, of course, public comments.  And some of them were wild and wooly accusations
that vaccines permanently injure people (sigh), or the extreme canard that they contain aborted
fetal cells (wildly false-to-fact), or bizarre assertions that the clinical trial enrolled
only whites (it was carefully designed to have multiple ethnic groups and both genders
adequately represented: 26% Latino, 10% Black).  

Why do we have to be so crazy?  Given we have to be so crazy, why do we also have to be so
_damn stupid?!_  

## Conclusion: today is a good day  

It's highly likely vaccinations can begin in earnest next week.  Moderna is following
fast, and will likely approximately double our vaccination capability by the week after
next.  

Though I still don't understand who on the VRBPAC abstained, or why&hellip; (Later: it
appears most of the "no" votes as well as the abstention were over the issue of 16-17 year
olds vs age 18 and over.  The younger ones were added later in the trial, and there's less
safety data for them.  That will be cleared up next year with pediatric trials.)  

## Added 2020-Dec-11: HHS Secretary Azar says FDA informed Pfizer it _will grant EUA_

Appearing on _Good Morning America_ with George Stephanopoulos early this morning, HHS
Secretary Azar confirms that the FDA has informed Pfizer this morning that it has granted
the Emergency Use Authorization.  Pending a bit of paperwork, vaccinations will begin
Monday or Tuesday of next week.  

Told you it would be Monday. :-)  

Also reported on _CNN_ <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, 
_WaPo_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, and most importantly by the 
FDA itself <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>, which said in part:  

> Following yesterday’s positive advisory committee meeting outcome regarding the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the __U.S. Food and Drug Administration has informed the sponsor that it will rapidly work toward finalization and issuance of an emergency use authorization.__ The agency has also notified the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed, so they can execute their plans for timely vaccine distribution.  


## Added 2020-Dec-12: the Republican clown car pulls up &amp; excretes Trump  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-10-pfizer-vaccine-passes-vrbpack-review-trump-performative-cruelty.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="Trump: performative cruelty" title="Trump: performative cruelty" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
In one of his trademark acts of performative cruelty &amp; ignorance, Trump intervened in
the FDA approval process, even though it's finished for all but a bit of paperwork.  On
Friday afternoon, he _publicly threatened_ FDA Commissioner Hahn that if he didn't get the
approval finished by Friday evening, he would have to resign; this for an EUA that was on
track for approval _the next day_. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup> (Just to set the scale
on your paranoia barometer, Trump is apparentlly asking suspiciously
if Pfizer is run by Democrats who are out to get him. <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>)  

As a result, instead of being approved Saturday morning, it was approved Friday night.
This makes _no difference whatsoever_ in the outcome, or in the timing of vaccinations.  

Trump simply had to be seen _personally_ as the cause of the vaccine, even if it involved pointless
whip-cracking on the backs of people busily pulling off a medical miracle.  Never mind
that Pfizer has refused any money from Operation Warp Speed, and thus the Trump cabal had
absolutely _nothing_ to do with the result.  By this act of performative stupidity and
cruelty, his "basket of deplorables" will believe otherwise.  That's what basket cases do,
apparently.
