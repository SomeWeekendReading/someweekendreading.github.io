Here at Chez Weekend, there's a rumor that on Christmas Eve, even Santa got pulled over by
the cops?!  

But it was ok, because the cops had [Probable Claus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause).

What are you looking down here for?  That was it.  That was the whole post.  All of it.
We're done here.  

Ok, fine: have a cat picture.  The Weekend Publisher didn't think the joke was that funny
either, when I told him.  As you can plainly see.  

He is a Good Cat, but not an especially Good Critic in these matters.  You should see his cat food
reviews.  Tough audience, he is.
