Last week several bombs were dropped: COVID vaccine efficacy with the Delta variant,
breakthrough infections, asymptomatic carriers, and changes in CDC guidelines.  Was the
panicky media coverage at all useful?  


## Vaccine efficacy vs Delta in the real world  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-04-vaccine-delta-cdc-stat.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="STAT News: Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine efficacy at 6 months" title="STAT News: Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine efficacy at 6 months" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
First, let's consider the news about "waning efficacy" of the mRNA vaccines.  _STAT News_,
as usual, had a very even-handed account. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  They noted
that a Pfizer preprint showed after 6 months:  
- The Pfizer vaccine had overall efficacy of 91% averaged over the period following 44,000
  volunteers. This is still outstandingly good.  
- Efficacy was 96% in the first 2 months, and 84% by the end.  So, a decline of about
  3%/month, which is actually pretty good.  
- It is unknown if that is due to fading immune response or the evolution of the virus
  into more virulent forms, like Delta.  
- Against _severe_ disease requiring hospitalization, it was 97% efficacy.  Very good,
  indeed.  
- At this rate of decline, efficacy would reach the benchmark threshold of 50% efficacy at
  18 months, which would be the time for a booster.  (Preferably a Delta-specific booster,
  but the original vaccine would also do.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-04-vaccine-delta-cdc-medrxiv.jpg" width="400" height="321" alt="medR&chi;iv: Thomas, et al. on Pfizer/vaccine efficacy at 6 months" title="medR&chi;iv: Thomas, et al. on Pfizer/vaccine efficacy at 6 months" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Other outlets were less measured in their reporting, along the lines of: "Glaah!  The
vaccines are fading, we're all gonna die!"  So let's ignore them and look directly at the
primary literature, namely the preprint itself. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  (It's a
preprint, so it's undergoing peer review right now.  But take it with a small grain of
salt.)  
- They had 44,165 subjects studied in a placebo-controlled, observer-blinded,
  multinational trial.  This isn't some tiny little study!  
- Overall efficacy was 91% (95% CI: 89.0% - 93.2%).  That's a nice, narrow confidence
  interval, so this looks statistically solid.  
- Efficacy vs severe disease was 97% (95% CI: 80.3% - 99.9%).  

Overall, it's a good, solid result: the vaccines still work even with the variants
present.  At the rate of decline of efficacy, it should be about a year before boosters
become _de rigueur_.  

__Conclusion:__  Don't panic.  At least not about this.  


## The CDC on Delta&colon; 'the war has changed'  

### The _WaPo_, the internal CDC slide deck, and media reaction  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-04-vaccine-delta-cdc-wapo.jpg" width="400" height="216" alt="WaPo: CDC internal report on Delta, vaccines, and transmissibility" title="WaPo: CDC internal report on Delta, vaccines, and transmissibility" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<iframe width="400" height="244" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gVRWnlJJDew" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
The _WaPo_ "obtained" a CDC internal slide presentation and reported on the state of
thinking at CDC. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  They describe it as "striking an urgent
note", which no doubt led to some of the media reaction.  They summarize the content in
basically 2 arms:  
- There is significant frustration at CDC with public communications.  Given the amount of
  superstitious fear and general interference by nearly every Republican politician, this
  is entirely understandable.  People are frustratingly becoming convinced that the
  vaccines no longer work.  But as you saw above, the efficacy is still 85% - 90%, which
  is the very definition of "works"!  
- We've been underestimating the the ease of transmission of Delta; it's worse than we
  generally thought, and we already thought it was pretty bad.  Vaccinated people can get
  asymptomatic Delta and spread it as easily as the much sicker unvaccinated.  So
  universal masking is a good idea, until herd immunity (late 2021/early 2022?).  

That provoked a lot of somewhat inflammatory reaction in other media.  One of the slightly
less inflammatory is shown here, from MSNBC.  Keep in mind if you watch it that _almost
everything else_ I saw was more inflammatory than this.  The things that went wrong here
are:  
- He's not interviewing anybody with domain expertise or COVID knowledge; he's
  interviewing one of the _WaPo_ reporters.  Basically reporters interviewing each other.
  This is how small errors get amplified.  
- There is, at best, minimal discussion of the _content_ of the CDC document, just what
  "people are saying" about it.  The little content that is discussed is the communication
  problems, not the actual data about the Delta variant (which is the important part).  
- His tone of voice is rather alarming, as if urging viewers to panic and outrage.   

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-04-vaccine-delta-cdc-cnn.jpg" width="400" height="139" alt="CNN: White House frustrated with hyperbolic Delta coverage" title="CNN: White House frustrated with hyperbolic Delta coverage" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Predictably, this did not escape reaction from senior political folk, as reported when CNN
talked to White House aides. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  They used words like
"hyperbolic", "irresponsible", and "alarmist".  Of course, they requested anonymity, which
sort of lowers their credibility at least with me.  Still&hellip;  
> "The media's coverage doesn't match the moment," one of the Biden officials told me. "It

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-04-vaccine-delta-cdc-axios.jpg" width="400" height="555" alt="Axios: Less than 0.1% of vaccinated tested positive" title="Axios: Less than 0.1% of vaccinated tested positive" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
At least some media outlets didn't "bury the lede".  A prime example is at Axios, where
Gonzalez &amp; Alberti make the point sharply <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>:  
- The rate of breakthrough infections among the vaccinated is very, very low: possibly
  around 0.1%.  
- The hospitalization rate is better, at around 0.004%.  
- The death rate is even lower, around 0.001%.  

Now that's the right message: yes, there _are_ breakthrough infections; but they are very rare, and
almost none result in hospitalization or death.  

As the CDC reported, breakthrough infections _can_ be spreaders, so it's a good idea to
wear a mask even if you're vaccinated.  If you're unvaccinated, then just realize you
should also mask, but being _voluntarily_ unvaccinated at this point is kind of suicidal.  


### Ok, so what exactly is in the internal CDC slide deck?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-04-vaccine-delta-cdc-1.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="CDC slide 1: Improving communications around vaccine breakthrough and vaccine effectiveness" title="CDC slide 1: Improving communications around vaccine breakthrough and vaccine effectiveness" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Here's the (frustratingly anonymized!) CDC slide deck <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>,
archived here in case it gets removed from the _WaPo_ web site.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-04-vaccine-delta-cdc-3.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="CDC slide 3: Vaccines dramatically reduce risks of infection, hospitalilzation, and death" title="CDC slide 3: Vaccines dramatically reduce risks of infection, hospitalilzation, and death" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
There's some entirely understandable venting about the problems of communicating with the
public, especially at the same time as disinformation actors like Republican officials.
Still, they manage to show that vaccines are _dramatically reducing risks as shown on
slide 3:  
- Infection risk is reduced 8 fold, corresponding to an efficacy of 100% * (1 - 1/8) =
  87.5%.  
- Both hospitalization and death risks are reduced 25 fold, for an efficacy of 
  100% * (1 - 1/25) = 96%.  
  
That's _fantastically_ good evidence that vaccines work, and work well.  Why wasn't this
one of the headlines in the news?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-04-vaccine-delta-cdc-15.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="CDC slide 15: Mortality vs transmissibility for various viral diseases" title="CDC slide 15: Mortality vs transmissibility for various viral diseases" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
One item that got some rather nervous side-eye is shown on slide 15.  Here the plot shows
$R_0$ on the horizontal axis (basically how many new cases of infection does each case
generate; it measures the ease of transmission for a disease).  The vertical axis is the
mortality on a log scale (what fraction of the infected people die).  Obviously, the upper
right corner (high transmission, high mortality) is where we _don't_ want to be.  

The inital strain of SARS-CoV2 is sown in the pink box at the lower left.  The box size
apparently shows the uncertainty band, though they don't quite come out and say so.  It's
about as transmissible as the common cold, but it kills somewhere between 0.1% &ndash;
1.0% of patients.  That's pretty bad, but&hellip;

The blue box is the Delta variant.  It's not remarkably higher in mortality (maybe just a
little).  But it's _way_ more transmissible!  It looks like they're estimating $R_0 \sim
5-9$, vs $R_0 \sim 1.5 - 2.5$ for the original strain.  So maybe 4 times more
transmissible, on average?  That's a huge deal.  It also puts Delta on a par with the
highly transmissible chicken pox, though thankfully not on a par with the horror that
would be measles ($R_0 \sim 15$).  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-04-vaccine-delta-cdc-17.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="CDC slide 17: Breakthrough infections in vaccinated people can cause spread" title="CDC slide 17: Breakthrough infections in vaccinated people can cause spread" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Another bit of bad news is in slide 17: although breakthrough infections in vaccinated
people are rare, once they happen those people can be asymptomatic spreaders to the
unvaccinated.  So the conclusion is: _everybody_ needs to mask up, so the vaccinated won't
be spreaders of Delta to the unvaccinated.  

Cue: infinite whining about masks, mask mandates, changing policy, etc.  This is why the
CDC said "the war has changed": Delta is worse enough that we have to go back to masking,
until the remaining unvaccinated can be made safe with vaccination.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The bad news:  
- Delta is more contagious than we thought, maybe on a par with chicken pox.  
- Vaccinated people can (rarely!) get asymptomatic Delta, and be spreaders.  

The good news:  
- The rate of breakthrough infections in the vaccinated is very, very low.  
- Vaccine efficacy remains high, both as measured in the Pfizer study and by the CDC study
  of cases, hospitalizations, and death rates.  
  
So to prevent any (rare!) asymptomatic Delta cases in the vaccinated from being spread,
_everybody_ should mask up again.
