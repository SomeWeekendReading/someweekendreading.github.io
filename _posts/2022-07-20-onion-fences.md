Two parables struck my eye this week: GK Chesterton's Fence, and Primo Levi's Onion in the Varnish.
Do they counsel actions that are opposite, or the same?  


## What's the Sitch?

I recently came across a _Less Wrong_ article by Joel Burget <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
comparing one of my favorite parables (Chesterton's Fence) with another by Italian chemist
and writer Primo Levi (Onion in the Varnish).  They are both compelling stories, as
parables must be.  

But they appear to counsel opposite actions?!  Let's look into that.  Outta the way; we
got books to read, here!  


## Chesterton's Fence

Frequent readers of this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), all 6 of you, will recall
that here at Chez Weekend we're fans of [GK Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton).

We especially admire some of his weirder novels like
[_The Man Who Was Thursday_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Was_Thursday).  (I
mean, really: cops confronting terrorists in a park, whereupon there ensues a single-combat duel by
exegesis on the nature of poetry?!  It gets weird, starting from _there._  Though, I have
to admit, the denouement is a bit of rather lame apologetics.  Still, the bulk of the book
is a good ride.)

The story of [Chesterton's Fence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence)
comes from his 1929 book, _The Thing_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> (__emphasis added__, _q.v._):  
 
> In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain
> and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists
> in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a
> fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to
> it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more
> intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I
> certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, __when you can come back
> and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.__'

(__NB:__ _The Thing_ was later subtitled, 'Why I am a Catholic', just so you know where
he's going here.)  

The moral seems clear, in line with the conservative bent of Chesterton that most makes me
squirm.  He counsels respect for culture, history, and institutions.  We should be
cautious and careful in the changes we make, lest the
[Law of Unintended Consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences)
bite us in our collective rear because we didn't understand what we were doing.  

For Chesterton, it seems to be fine if you don't like the fence.  But you should _first_
dig a bit to figure out if there's some good reason for it with which you are not as yet
familiar.  Upon encountering a mysterious &amp; inconvenient fence, we should first remove
they mystery before removing the inconvenience.  

This seems to be the classic conservative (not the rabid/stupid modern US version) outlook
of taking care in making changes, because society is fragile and barbarism is just a few
steps away.  

So, like Catullus, I have a bit of an [_odi et amo_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus_85)
relationship with this.  I applaud the effort to understand our antecedents and the
context they have bequeathed us; I abhor the implicit authoritarianism in "I may allow
you" to make a needed change.  

Just to give you an idea of Chesterton's ability to captivate with a well-turned sentence,
he summarizes the issue of 'reformers' not appreciating their forebears:  

> There are reformers who get over this difficulty by assuming that all their fathers were
> fools; but if that be so, we can only say that folly appears to be a hereditary
> disease.  

I mean, you don't have to agree to admire the beauty of it, with just the perfect amount
of highly refined snark.  


## Levi's Onion in the Varnish  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-20-onion-fences-levi-periodic-table.jpg" width="400" height="624" alt="Levi: The Periodic Table" title="Levi: The Periodic Table" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The counterpoint comes from Italian chemist and author, Primo Levi.  In
_The Periodic Table_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, he offers a story from his time
working for a manufacturer of varnish:  
- The oil had to be boiled at a certain temperature, in order for certain reactions to
  happen.  
- More than a little inexplicably, the workers would at that point toss a raw onion, or slice
  of an onion, into the mixture.  
  
This, of course, makes no sense.  The onion is not contributing anything measurable in a
huge vat of boiling linseed oil.  Yet they were adamant: onion, or no varnish.  

He asked elderly colleagues who had worked on varnishes in their youth.   He finally
came upon Giacomasso Olindo at age 70, who had been involved with varnishes for 50 years.
He said that the varnish recipes were of course ancient (as in _thousands of years_ ancient!),
and thus predated the widespread use of thermometers.  So the workers would throw in a couple
onion slices to see if they would fry; if so, the linseed oil had reached the proper
temperature and one could proceed.  

Of course, in a 20th century factory with thermometers, the onion had degenerated to more
of a superstitious _id&eacute;e fixe_ than anything useful.  People had an extreme over-adherence to
tradition that kept them putting in the onion, because they _did not know_ what the
onion did.  

It's a perfect example of the failure of the over-conservative mind: adhering to tradition
as goal in itself, not because it was useful.  Of course you should stop throwing onions
in varnish!  

### Revenant Varnish Onions  

It gets better: Levi next tells the tale of "livered varnishes", which due to some impurity or
other had the wrong color and texture.  He looked at the assays of chromium oxide, and
found that all the quality checks quoted 29.5%&hellip; _exactly._  Clearly somebody had
forged the assay reports, or used a defective method, or an impure reagent to get
"those so obviously suspicious but formally blameless results".  

It also turned out the recipe card had said "2 or 3 drops" of chromate, but was so stained and worn
that they were putting in "23 drops" of chromate in a batch.  This was undetected because
the chromate assay afterward was just wrong, always giving 29.5% as desired.  

Levi figured out that adding ammonium chloride would fix the bad batches, and demonstrated
this experimentally.  

Problem solved?  Not really: his temporary fix became a permanent ingredient long after
the time it was needed, another "onion in the varnish" (__emphasis__ added):  

> Since the storeroom contained several shipments of perilously basic chromate, which must
> also be utilized because they had been accepted by the inspection and could not be
> returned to the supplier, the chloride was officially introduced as an antilivering
> preventive in the formula of that varnish.  
>  
> Then I quit my job: ten years went by, the postwar years were over, the deleterious, too
> basic chromates disappeared from the market, and my report went the way of all flesh:
> but formulas are as holy as prayers, decree-laws, and dead languages, and not an iota in
> them can be changed. __And so my ammonium chloride, the twin of a happy love and a
> liberating book, by now completely useless and probably a bit harmful, is religiously
> ground into the chromate anti-rust paint on the shore of that lake, and nobody knows why
> anymore.__

So that's two separate illustrations of an over-conservative mind-set: the onion and the
ammonium chloride, both being used despite having outlived their usefulness.  People
_just will not_ go to the mental effort of understanding things, but will instead defer to
the authority of a "time-tested" recipe.  

That's superstition, and we're better off without it.  


## So are they opposites, or not?  

At first glance, these stories appear to be in conflict: 
- Chesterton appears to say don't challenge received culture until you understand it
  deeply, but
- Levi says to challenge all sorts of things because they may be obsolete and kept
  in place just to avoid thinking.  

It's frustrating: both are told with such endearing anecdotes, we want to embrace both.
But we can't, if they're contradictory!  

Burget wisely points out that the contradiction is superficial: both counsel getting a
deep understanding of the situation _before_ making changes.  Levi, unlike Chesterton,
told us about the long, hard work involved in doing that in 2 examples.  And, alas again
unlike Chesterton, that the moment you loosen your grip, less rational tradition will
re-impose your changes as an unquestionable recipe.  

The onion in the varnish is an example of properly handling (and, at least in this case,
dismantling) a Chesterton fence.  The ammonium chloride story, on the other hand, is
testament to people's insistence on re-building inexplicable Chesterton fences, probably
built out of varnished onions.  

So there _are_ unintended consequences, and we should arm ourselves with deep situational
understanding to avoid them.  But there is also an apparently irresistible gravitational
pull in most people toward tradition. Even the most pragmatic reform will be reduced to
unquestionable tradition eventually.  

What things in my life are traditions that should be questioned, so they may be understood
deeply or improved where possible?  

It's a weird, weird world.
