Today the Weekend Editrix got her annual flu vax and COVID-19 bivalent booster.  Let's
look at why that's a good idea for all of us.  

[__NB:__ This post is about events of 2022-Nov-21, but is posted somewhat delayed by
several days. Thanksgiving holiday here in the US, you know!]  


## Where COVID-19 Antibody Technology May Be Going  

The current mRNA vaccines are absolutely astounding: usually you're looking at 5-10 years,
and we got vaccines of &gt; 90% efficacy (initially) within about 9 months!  That's just
flabbergasting.  

However, it's not the last word.  There are lots of developments!  None of the existing
antibody therapies work any more against Omicron/BA.4-5; let's look through the literature
to see what the future might bring in the way of antibodies.  


### A super-duper antibody  

First, the indispensable Eric Topol alerts us to a broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb)
that works on all SARS-CoV2 variants through Omicron/BA.5:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1577727060667047936">

</a>


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-sciadv-1.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="Kumar, et al. @ Sci Adv: A broadly neutralizing SARS-CoV2 antibody" title="Kumar, et al. @ Sci Adv: A broadly neutralizing SARS-CoV2 antibody" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
He's pointing us to a _Science Advances_ paper <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>.  The
practical upshot is:  
- If we can make this antibody (eventually, we can) then it can be used as a therapy.
  _There are no remaining effective antibody therapies,_ so this is important!  
- If we can create a vaccine which causes the body to produce this antibody (maybe?) then
  we can make a broadly effective vaccine, also important!  
  
How was it found?  Not as a result of any structural biology/protein trimer docking
calculation, but empirically!  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-sciadv-2.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-sciadv-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="248" alt="Kumar, et al. @ Sci Adv: Potency curves vs spike IgG and live virus" title="Kumar, et al. @ Sci Adv: Potency curves vs spike IgG and live virus" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
</a>
They extracted antibodies from 42 convalescent patients in India (all with the ancestral
Wuhan WA.1 strain in 2020), and just tested the antibodies.  This one targets a
conformationally conserved (infrequently mutated) epitope on the outer face of the
receptor binding domain (RBD) where it grabs ACE2.  
- Start with 42 patients, narrowed down to 5 with high SARS-CoV2 RBD binding titers.  
- Select 398 antibodies, of which 208 were cloned &amp; expressed.  
- 92 had their RBD binding curves measured, getting 48 hits that block ACE2 binding.  
- Of those, 18 had good neutralizing curves against live viruses.  

The one so euphoniously yclept "002-S21F2" was the best of breed, as shown here in their
Figure 1.  There's a lot more in the paper, in terms of assays and characterization of the
immunologic properties of this antibody.  But the bottom line is that they've found a very
beautiful antibody that works very broadly against the then-extant variants.  

It's a hopeful sign that we might be able to manufacture this antibody and have an
effective therapy again for those who can't take paxlovid!  


### And&hellip; another antibody  

Next, the equally indispensable Delthia Ricks alerts us to another broadly neutralizing
antibody:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/DelthiaRicks/status/1568858360371625985">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-twitter-2.jpg" width="550" height="617" alt="Ricks @ Twitter: Another broadly neutralizing ab developed in a mouse model" title="Ricks @ Twitter: Another broadly neutralizing ab developed in a mouse model" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
</a>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-mednews-1.jpg" width="400" height="195" alt="Siharthan @ News Medical: A broadly neutralizing antibody" title="Siharthan @ News Medical: A broadly neutralizing antibody" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-sci-immunol-1.jpg" width="400" height="234" alt="Luo, et al. @ Sci Immunol: A broadly neutralizing antibody from a mouse model" title="Luo, et al. @ Sci Immunol: A broadly neutralizing antibody from a mouse model" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
She's pointing us to a summary news article in _News Medical_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
which in turn points us to the primary source, an article in
_Science Immunology_. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

Interestingly, this study works from a mouse model instead of sampling convalescent
patients.  This has pluses and minuses.  They bred a mouse whose immune system slightly
resembled a human's (the primary B cell receptor (BCR) was generated through V(D)J
recombination with a human V${}\_{\textsf{H}}$1-2 heavy chain and human 
V${}\_{\kappa}$1-33 light chain). There's a _lot_ more going on there, but basically
the mice respond in certain narrow immunological contexts like humans (sort of).  So if
you stimulate them with SARS-CoV2 spike protein, they might generate antibodies that would
be of use to humans.  

The big plus is that you can generate a _lot_ of mice, infect/immunize them with the Wuhan
variant's spike protein (not the whole virus), and start harvesting a wide variety of
antibodies to test.  Their best was again "euphoniously yclept" SP1-77.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-sci-immunol-2.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-sci-immunol-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="274" alt="Neutralization curves of 3 abs vis pseudotype virus and live virus" title="Neutralization curves of 3 abs vis pseudotype virus and live virus" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
</a>
Here in their Figure 3 we can see how well it did. We're looking at the neutralization of
two pseudotype viruses and the real virus, by 3 antibodies.  The rows in the table are the
antibodies (SP1-77 is the first row), and the columns are viral variants.  The number
tells us the IC50 in ng/ml units (lower is better, i.e., the antibody stops the virus at
lower concentrations.  The columns in the table are viral variants.  The color encodes the
concentration, with deeper/darker reds denoting more potent antibodies.  

The thing to note is that SP1-77 had _activity against all variants,_ with potency against
the live virus ranging from 0.8 - 12.1 ng/ml.  This is very, very good!  


## Better Vaccines  

Now, antibodies are nice.  Great, even, if we can manufacture them in quantity for
infusions.  Maybe greater if they guide us to better vaccines so we don't _need_ the
infusions.  So what's on the horizon for vaccinations?  


### Bivalent spike/nucleocapsid vaccine  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-latimes-1.jpg" width="400" height="540" alt="Purtill @ LATimes: Experimental COVID-19 vaccination with S and N antigens" title="Purtill @ LATimes: Experimental COVID-19 vaccination with S and N antigens" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-scitranslmed-1.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="Hajnik, et al. @ SciTranslMed: Spike/nucleocapsid mRNA vax for variant protection" title="Hajnik, et al. @ SciTranslMed: Spike/nucleocapsid mRNA vax for variant protection" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Some months ago on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads,
[we dissed the use of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein]({{ site.baseurl }}/n-abs-severe-covid-19/).
It's basically a terrible single target, since it's
inside the viral capsule and thus not visible until _after_ infecting a cell.  As a
biomarker, it tends to indicate patients who had _severe_ disease, not diverse immunity.

In response, sharp-eyed [commenter Mike pointed out]({{ site.baseurl }}/n-abs-severe-covid-19/#comment-df2e2bf0-3534-11ed-a5bc-c94d3ddbcd6f)
an article in the _LA Times_ <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> on using the nucleocapsid
protein, not as a single target, but an _additional_ target along with the spike protein
(S).  That's interesting:  
- A bivalent vaccine can use 2 proteins from the same virus.  
- The N protein mutates less often (_because_ it's inside the viral envelope and subject
  to less evolutionary pressure), meaning immunity should be more stable with respect to
  the more frequent S mutations.  
- Severe vaccine invasion might indeed require _double_ mutations in both N and S, which
  is a very intriguing property.  
- Animal studies seemed to point to T cell immunity more quickly, not just antibodies.  
  
We followed this to the primary source, a paper in the big-time journal
_Science Translational Medicine._  <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  Basically they tried
a combined S and N gene mRNA vaccine, and compared with just the usual S mRNA.  Some
findings:  
- Better protection against both Delta and Omicron as measured by viral presence in lungs
&amp; upper respiratory tract.  
- Alterations in _in vivo_ CD8+ T cells, suggesting increased T cell stimulation,
  validated by experiments with CD8+ T cell depleted hamsters.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-scitranslmed-2.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-scitranslmed-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="457" alt="Hajnik, et al. @ SciTranslMed: Effects of S+N vax on hamsters vs Omicron" title="Hajnik, et al. @ SciTranslMed: Effects of S+N vax on hamsters vs Omicron" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
</a>
Their Figure 4 is the main deal here, showing the effect of control, S, and S+N
vaccination on hamsters exposed to Omicron:  
- Fig 4B: Note that log viral copies in the lung at 2 days post-infection is dramatically
  lower with S+N than with just S or nothing.  
- Fig 4D: Same thing still holds at 4 days post infection.  
- Fig 4H: The same thing holds for nasal washes at 2 days, indicating that the virus is
  still statistically significantly lower in the upper resipiratory tract.  
- Fig 4J&amp;K: Note that the effect partly goes away when given to CD8+ T cell depleted
  animals.  This indicates that T cell immunity is being strongly stimulated and plays a
  positive role here, which is a very good thing to see.  
  
Ok, so perhaps in the future we'll see bivalent vaccines, not with 2 different strains of
spike mRNA, but with spike and nucleocapside mRNA?  


### Combination COVID-19/flu vaccination  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-reuters-1.jpg" width="400" height="365" alt="Reuters: Pfizer &amp; BioNTech COVID-flu combo vax study" title="Reuters: Pfizer &amp; BioNTech COVID-flu combo vax study" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-pfizer-1.jpg" width="400" height="197" alt="Pfizer/BioNTech Phase 1 study of COVID-19/flu combo vaccine" title="Pfizer/BioNTech Phase 1 study of COVID-19/flu combo vaccine" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-moderna-1.jpg" width="400" height="161" alt="Moderna R&amp;D day includes review of COVID-19/flu combo vaccine trial" title="Moderna R&amp;D day includes review of COVID-19/flu combo vaccine trial" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Currently, COVID-19 vaccines and flu vaccines are being offered at the same time.  Not in
the same shot, but at the same time and people are being encouraged to get them both at
once.  Not that there's any particular reason to combine them, but you get better "patient
compliance": people will show up once, but probably not twice.  

What if we could combine those 2 vaccines?  Say, some mRNA for COVID-19 (maybe S+N, or
even multiple variants) and flu?  I mean, flu vaccines are already multivalent:
[the one I got this year had 4 different strains!]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot-12th-time/)

So it's with some gratification that I came across a _Reuters_ article and a Pfizer press
release noting that Pfizer &amp; BioNTech are starting a trial on exactly
that. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  Moderna has been
at it for a while, having announced their program almost a year ago, but they did mention
it's still ongoing in their most recent "R&amp;D Days" review of clinical
programs. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>

So maybe next year, instead of getting multiple injections for COVID-19 and flu, we'll
just get one very complicated mRNA vaccine for both.  Increased patient compliance means
more people will be vaccinated.  That's a pleasant thought, no?  


### The present day: BQ.1 and BQ.1.1  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-globe-1.jpg" width="400" height="144" alt="Cross @ Globe: New coronavirus variants and their impact" title="Cross @ Globe: New coronavirus variants and their impact" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
From the venerable _Boston Globe_ comes a survey article <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>
warning us of new variants and all the havoc they are going to wreak in the near future,
mostly on those not fully vaccinated.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-cdc-1.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-cdc-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="573" alt="CDC Nowcast 2022-Nov: BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 taking over" title="CDC Nowcast 2022-Nov: BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 taking over" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
</a>
First, the CDC's "nowcast" of SARS-CoV2 variants in the US is the canary in the coal mine:
- We note that the fearsome Omicron/BA.5 (19.4%, CL: 17.1% - 21.9%) is on the wane, being
  replaced by BQ.1 (27.9%, CL: 25.5% - 30.5%) and BQ.1.1 (27.0%, CL: 27.0% - 31.9%).
  Given the fearsome aggressiveness with which BA.4/5 spread, this is impressive &ndash;
  and a bit scary.  
- Think about it: the BQ variants together are 57.3% of the infections in the US, at least
  of the ones that show up in a hospital and are sequenced.  

Alarmingly, all antibody therapies are now useless against COVID-19.  This
includes the latest bebtelovimab for treatment, and evusheld for prevention in those who
cannot be vaccinated.  Basically, we have vaccination, paxlovid, and non-pharmaceutical
interventions (NPIs) like masking &amp; social distancing.  

Fortunately, hospitalization numbers are not rising.  It appears BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 are
_replacing_ BA.4/5, but not causing new cases over and above what BA.4/5 would have
caused.  Apparently the background of vaccination and some post-infection immunity are
helping us out there.

Knowing how the existing vaccines (including the bivalent booster tuned to BA.4/5) work
against BQ.1 and BQ.1.1 is _essential._  We know the antibody levels will be lower, but by
how much?  Several studies paint a rather grim picture:  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-biorxiv-1.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-biorxiv-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="196" alt="Miller, et al. @ bioRxiv: Note 7x decrease in ab titers for BQ.1.1 vs BA.5 for those with bivalent boosters" title="Miller, et al. @ bioRxiv: Note 7x decrease in ab titers for BQ.1.1 vs BA.5 for those with bivalent boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
</a>
- A preprint from a group in virology &amp; vaccines at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
  Center <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> suggests a 7-fold reduction in antibody
  levels vs BQ.1.1.  
  - Their Figure 1 parts B-D, reproduced here, show the neutralizing antibody titers vs
    various SARS-CoV2 lineages for people with varying vaccination statuses.  
    - The most relevant part here at Chez Weekend is part D, where we're looking at those
      with a bivalent booster.  
    - If you compare the levels against BA.5 (purple) vs BQ.1.1 (blue), you can see it's
      labelled as a factor of 7x lower.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-biorxiv-2.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-biorxiv-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="171" alt="Davis-Gardner, et al. @ BioRxiv: Lower neutralization with BQ.1.1" title="Davis-Gardner, et al. @ BioRxiv: Lower neutralization with BQ.1.1" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
</a>
- A preprint from Emory broadly agrees. <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup> Shown here is
  their Figure 1, which has their evidence.  While the figure is hard to read, the paper
  reports levels for bivalently-boosted subjects in the FRNT assay of 576 for BA.5 vs 112
  for BQ.1.1.  So that's a ratio of 5.14x reduction.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-biorxiv-3.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-11-21-weekend-editrix-bivalent-flu-shots-biorxiv-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="287" alt="Kurhade, et al. @ bioRxiv: Also reduced response to BQ.1.1" title="Kurhade, et al. @ bioRxiv: Also reduced response to BQ.1.1" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
</a>
- Finally, a preprint from UTexas gets more or less comparable
  results. <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  Figure 1D tells the story for people with
  bivalent boosters. The figure's a little easier to read here: 1558 for the BA.4/5 spike
  vs 267 for the BQ.1.1 spike.  That's a ratio of 5.83x reduction.

What does all this mean?  

In the short term, you have something like 5-7x lower resistance to initial infection.  In
the longer term, you still have memory B cells that will spin up more antibodies and T
cells that will fight off the infection and even kill infected cells.  They're a bit more
slow than just having antibodies on hand, but they work.  You'll probably get infected,
but fight it off quickly and only get a mild case.  This is what vaccines are _supposed to do!_  

Also, note that the reductions in antibody titers are for people who are fully vaccinated
and boosted, with the new bivalent booster.  If your vaccination is less than that, your
antibody decrease is _even worse,_ almost to the point where you have little protection at
all.  Strong incentive to get boosted with the bivalent booster!  


### More optimistic reports from the vaccine makers  

Pfizer <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup> and Moderna <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup>
of course have a sunnier view of things, as one might expect:  
- Pfizer notes that the antibody levels vs BQ.1.1 go up 4.8 fold after the bivalent
  booster, but fail to point out that the level is still lower than for BA.5 or even the
  original virus.  
- Moderna said the response was "robust" but didn't support that with any data, other than
  noting it was 5x lower than for BA.4/5.  This further cemented our prejucide here at
  Chez Weekend about the general uselessness of corporate press releases.  

The venerable _Globe_ wisely quoted Dan Barouch (the lab head behind the Miller paper <sup>[14]</sup>,
and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at BIDMC):  

> "The current vaccines are likely not going to provide substantial and sustained
> protection against infection, even with boosters," Barouch said. "But these vaccines
> will likely still provide __substantial protection against severe disease, and that is the
> most important goal of vaccines.__"  (Weekend emphasis added.)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

&hellip; and _that's_ why the Weekend Editrix today got her bivalent booster (Moderna) and
an annual flu shot.  We're all vaxed up here at Chez Weekend, waiting for our immune
systems to build immunity for the possible winter tridemic: another COVID-19 variant,
influenza, and RSV.  

Can't do much about RSV, but we've done all we can about the other two.  

You should too.
