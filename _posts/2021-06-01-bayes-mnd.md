[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) (back in 2012!) about the famous book, [_The Millionaire Next Door_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door).  It's good as far as it goes; it just doesn't go _nearly_ as far as almost everybody thinks!  


## The Millionaire Next Door  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-01-bayes-mnd-mnd-book.jpg" width="300" height="450" alt="Stanley &amp; Danko: The Millionaire Next Door" title="Stanley &amp; Danko: The Millionaire Next Door" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
In 1996, Stanley &amp; Danko published a now-famous book which amounted to an empirical
sociological survey of people in the US who were millionaires: 
[_The Millionaire Next Door_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door). <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
To say the least, it struck a nerve.  The empirical data did _not_ confirm the stereotypes
of expensive clothes, cars, and jewelry.  They did not live in large houses.  They were
not lavish spenders.  

Stanley &amp; Danko quoted the astonished words of a VP of a bank trust department
<sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>:

> These people cannot be millionaires! They don't look like millionaires, they don't dress
> like millionaires, they don't eat like millionaires, they don't act like
> millionaires &mdash; they don't even have millionaire names. Where are the millionaires who
> look like millionaires?  

(Keep in mind this book was published 25 years ago.  A million dollars in the US was
significantly more money back then!  According to the 
[Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI inflation calculator](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm),
a million in 1996 is about \$1.7 million in mid-2021.)  

The main results of Stanley & Danko are:  
- _Millionaires don't buy status junk._ They tend to look pretty ordinary.  They are not
  flashy at all.  People who look flashy are cosplayers attempting to _look_ rich.  As an
  example, Stanley & Danko described their bank trust officer above as wearing a fancy
  suit, a \$5000 watch, and driving a current-model luxury imported car.  He was attempting
  to look rich, to win the trust of rich customers.  He was not, himself, rich.  (NB:
  _billionaires_, on the other hand, are a different sort of duck.)  
- _Millionaires spend less than they earn, and invest the difference._  They don't spend
  tomorrow's money today, but have budgets.  
- _Millionaires take financial risk only when it's worth it._  They don't buy lottery
  tickets, speculate in insanely risky investments like commodities/options/penny stocks,
  and they are adequately insured (health, life, disability, liability, etc.).  
- _Millionaires educate their kids in financial literacy, and get them into
  self-sustaining careers._  Their kids are not continually needing parental support
  because they got good educations that led to useful, satisfying careers where they can
  support themselves (e.g., STEM degrees and professions).  Or they started small
  businesses that had a shot at success.  

They derived a jargony formula, for determining "average accumulators of wealth (AAW)" and
"prodigious accumulators of wealth (PAW)".  Basically, for an AAW your age times your
income, divided by 10, should be about your net worth excluding inheritances.  A PAW
should do about twice that.  Here are some [R](https://www.r-project.org) functions to
help you explore that:  
```R
    mndAAW <- function(age, inc) { 0.1 * age * inc      }
    mndPAW <- function(age, inc) { 2 * mndAAW(age, inc) }
```

I once realized these could be worked backwards: given your age and net worth, what income
would a PAW need to achieve that?  If your income is lower, congratulations: you're
accumulating net worth even faster than a PAW.  If your income is higher, figure out where
you can spend more efficiently &amp; save more.  
```R
    pawInc <- function(age, nw)  { 5 * nw / age         }
```

## What's wrong with that?  

So that's&hellip; fine, I guess?  It's nice to know that the people in the upper middle
class and the lower end of the upper class seem much more down to earth than the
sociopathic billionaires.  (I just made an interesting typo: "villionaires", perhaps a
portmanteau of "villain" and "billionaire"?  Hmm.)  

What got people's engines revving, particularly those of the more feverishly conservative or
libertarian sort, was that apparently 2/3 of the millionaires interviewed were owners of
small businesses.  "Aha!  That's for me," they thought, "I'll start a business and get
rich!"  They always think business owners are the savoirs of society, and seized upon this
as though it were empirical evidence.  

That's just&hellip; _wrong_.  

First, the book is an empirical survey of people who are _already_ millionaires.  It is
_not_ a survey of the sorts of people who _become_ millionaires and the ways they do that.
It does not talk about all the people who resemble the interviewed millionaires but failed
to become rich through bad luck, poor timing, isolated geography, or anything else.  

Second, the misunderstanding betrays a fundamental ignorance of statistics.  Stanley &amp;
Danko asked: if we sample millionaires, what sort of people are they?  The fever dream
people were doing the reverse: if we sample people of a certain sort, are they likely to
be or become millionaires?  

So there's _nothing at all wrong_ with Stanley &amp; Danko's book: it's fine, as far as it
goes.  It just doesn't go where most people _think_ it goes!  


## Letting some air out of the balloon with Bayes Rule  

We can show this, with some slight degree of melodrama, using
[Bayes' Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem).  

Stanley &amp; Danko's research demonstrates that if you sample millionaires, you're likely
to find that about 2/3 of them own a business:

$$
\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich}) = 2/3
$$

But the question to which most readers wanted the answer was not about the characteristics
of those _already_ rich.  Rather, they want to know what characteristics to adopt to _become_
rich themselves.  They want to know what's the probability of achieving financial
security, if they start a business:  

$$
\Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business}) = \mathrm{?}
$$

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-01-bayes-mnd-mnd-business-survival.jpg" width="400" height="249" alt="BLS: 55% of businesses die in 4 years" title="BLS: 55% of businesses die in 4 years" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
The truth is, most businesses flame out early: the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says
about 55% of businesses die within 4 years. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  So there is
some danger here.  

Can we estimate $\Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business})$ from 
$\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich})$ and some ancillary data, to see what the actual
chance of success at getting rich from a business is?  Yes, that's what Bayes' Rule does for us:  

$$
\begin{align*}
  \Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business}) &= \frac{\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich}) \times \Pr(\mathrm{rich})}{\Pr(\mathrm{business})} \\
                                         &= \frac{\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich}) \times \Pr(\mathrm{rich})}{\Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich}) \times \Pr(\mathrm{rich}) + \Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{nonrich}) \times \Pr(\mathrm{nonrich})}
\end{align*}
$$

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-01-bayes-mnd-mnd-top-1-percent.jpg" width="400" height="423" alt="Business Insider: wealth to be in top 1% in various countries" title="Business Insider: wealth to be in top 1% in various countries" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-01-bayes-mnd-mnd-bls-self-employment.jpg" width="400" height="237" alt="BLS: US self-employment (excluding agriculture) vs time" title="BLS: US self-employment (excluding agriculture) vs time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
So we need to know $\Pr(\mathrm{rich})$ (the probability somebody is rich), and 
$\Pr(\mathrm{business})$ (the probability they own a business):  
- For being "rich", let's target the top 1% of US wealth, which is about a net worth of
  \$4.4 million. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  Unsurprisingly, the probability of being
  in the top 1% is&hellip; 1%.  
- A BLS statistic <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> tells us that about the self-employed
  component of the US has been declining over time, but is about 7.5% today. (Outside
  agriculture; agriculture is a whole different beast, but it is a terribly small part of
  the work force today.)  We'll use "self-employed" as a probable _overestimate_ of the
  business-owners.  We'll also use this as a proxy for the "not rich" business owners,
  since we assume becoming rich is relatively rare.  
  
So here's what we know:  

$$
\begin{align*}
  \Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{rich})    &= 0.67  \\
  \Pr(\mathrm{business} | \mathrm{nonrich}) &= 0.075 \\
  \Pr(\mathrm{rich})                        &= 0.01  \\
  \Pr(\mathrm{nonrich})                     &= 0.99
\end{align*}
$$

Plug that into Bayes' Rule above:  

$$
\Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business}) = \frac{0.67 * 0.01}{0.67 * 0.01 + 0.075 * 0.99} = 8.3\%
$$

So basically, if you think owning a business is the road to riches, you're thinking about
a road with only an 8.3% chance of going where you want to end up!  Ok, sure, that's more
than the 1% chance you'd have if you started at random, but 8.3% is by no means certain.
All it says is that the business class is "enriched for richness", not that starting a
business will _make_ you rich.  


## A modest counterpoint  

Perhaps someone will point out, as someone always does, that the top 1% of the US is a
bunch of evil super-villain billionaires.  I mean, that's factually false, since the data above
says the entry threshold is \$4.4 million, not a billion!  (But
[see below:](#addendum-what-are-the-net-worth-deciles-in-the-us) the 1%-ile threshold may
be almost 3x higher, using different datasets.) But let's indulge this 
theoretical critic, since critics are the most valuable friends an idea can have.  

Instead, let's just say the target for "rich" is being in the financial top 10% of the
US.  Surely that's pretty comfortable?  Wouldn't we like to know if starting a business
could at least raise the chance we could be comfortable?  

Let's see if that's a possibility:  

$$
\Pr(\mathrm{rich} | \mathrm{business}) = \frac{0.67 * 0.10}{0.67 * 0.10 + 0.075 * 0.90} = 49.8\%
$$

Now _there's_ something to talk about: you get a 50% shot at being in the top decile of
wealth.  You've _quintupled_ your chances.  

Of course, there are other ways: get a good university degree perhaps in a STEM field,
perhaps get an advanced degree, work in an industry that does some good in the world, live
below your means and invest the difference.  At retirement age, you'll be comfortable.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

We've examined some popular sentiment about Stanley &amp; Danko's _The Millionaire Next
Door_.  As an exploratory study in the sociology of wealth in the US 25 years ago, there's
nothing at all wrong with it.  Good work.  

It does _not_, however, imply what many people think: owning a business is not a road to
riches.  The path to success there is only about 8.3%, after a Bayesian analysis.
However, doing _anything_ productive with your life, sustained over time, with reasonable
spending budgets and intelligent investing&hellip; will likely have a good outcome.

There's no magic here: you don't _have_ to be a business owner.  You _do_ have to be
productive, patient, and reasonably able to budget.  


## Addendum 2021-Jun-02: What are the net worth deciles in the US, really?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-01-bayes-mnd-gini.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="Wikipedia: World GINI coefficients, showing US at 0.9" title="Wikipedia: World GINI coefficients, showing US at 0.9" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
The claim that \$4.4 million was the threshold for joining the 1% in the US just sticks in
my craw a little bit.  We're so _desperately_ unequal, with a 
[Gini coefficient of 0.9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient), worse than in
the Gilded Age, that I find this hard to accept.  Maybe it's time to look at a second data
source.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-01-bayes-mnd-nyt-net-worth-percentiles.jpg" width="400" height="368" alt="NYT: US net worth percentiles at age 65 in 2019" title="NYT: US net worth percentiles at age 65 in 2019" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
So I had a look at the net worth percentile calculator from the _New York Times_ back in
2019, which is reasonably recent.  <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  That does an
age-dependent net worth percentile calculation, so I assumed age 65+ to measure net worth
at the threshold of retirement.  It's based on the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer
Finances for the years 2013 &ndash; 2016 (apparently Table 2, p 13).
<sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  

That confirmed a couple of things:  
- The 99th percentile has a net worth above almost \$12 million, substantially more than
  claimed in the _Business Insider_ article, and more in line with my intuition.  
- The 90th percentile, on the other hand was at a more negotiable threshold of \$2 million
  or so.  _That's_ more like something we can discuss as a goal for retiring
  "comfortably", or a bit more than comfortably for most people.  
  
So [the calculation above for the 10%-ile](#a-modest-counterpoint) is more relevant to
Stanley &amp; Danko's work than the 1%-ile, who are &uuml;ber-wealthy.  It _doesn't_ make
sense that there's any recipe for being in the 1%-ile, since they're largely the result of
inherited wealth or lightning-strike levels of good luck.  But it _does_ make some sense
that sensible kinds of work (start a small business, or get a STEM degree and work in a
productive industry) sustained patiently will reward one with entry to the top decile, or
near there.
