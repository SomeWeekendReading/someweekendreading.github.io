Matthew Herper at _STAT News_ is, as usual, on the case.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
There was the official FDA news relase this morning.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

This is not full approval, but an Emergency Use Authorization.  Because&hellip;
_emergency._  Another sign of their efforts at speed is that they didn't convene the AMDAC
committee of external advisors to pass judgement, like they did with molnupiravir.  This
indicates (a) they're in a hurry to get this out, and (b) the data are really, very, very,
good.  

The authorization is for age 12 and up.  

Mysteriously, it is _not_ authorized for prevention in case of exposure.  Maybe the drug
interactions of the ritonavir component have people feeling a bit cautious.  They did
explicitly mention this.  

The FDA accepted that the efficacy vs hospitalization was 88%.  

Here at Chez Weekend, we approve fully.  Not that anyone should care.
