&hellip; aaaaand, today [the suspense is over](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/veni-veni-paxlovid/#addendum-2021-dec-21-rumor-has-fda-approval-this-week): the FDA has authorized paxlovid.  


## Paxlovid is legal

Matthew Herper at _STAT News_ is, as usual, on the case.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
There was the official FDA news relase this morning.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

This is not full approval, but an Emergency Use Authorization.  Because&hellip;
_emergency._  Another sign of their efforts at speed is that they didn't convene the AMDAC
committee of external advisors to pass judgement, like they did with molnupiravir.  This
indicates (a) they're in a hurry to get this out, and (b) the data are really, very, very,
good.  

The authorization is for age 12 and up.  

Mysteriously, it is _not_ authorized for prevention in case of exposure.  Maybe the drug
interactions of the ritonavir component have people feeling a bit cautious.  They did
explicitly mention this.  

The FDA accepted that the efficacy vs hospitalization was 88%.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Here at Chez Weekend, we approve _fully._  (Not that anyone should care about that;
instead care about people getting effective treatment, which is A Good Thing.)  


## Addendum 2021-Dec-23: A trawl through the data  

One of the drawbacks to sidestepping the advisory committes (AMDAC or VRBPAC) is that we
don't get public availability of the filing documents, the slide decks, and so on.  Those
are _really_ informative.  

But here, [as with evusheld](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/fda-evusheld/), we have
to rely on skimpier sources, starting with the FDA press release.  So here's what we've
got, working forward from the press release and following links:  

- The clinical trial itself, called EPIC-HR and given the id NCT04960202 at
  ClinicalTrials.gov. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  
- The Pfizer fact sheet for patients, parents, and caregivers, i.e., explaining to
  non-medical people what's happening to them. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  
- The Pfizer fact sheet for healthcare providers, with a lot more technical information
  and pragmatic use guidelines. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  
- The FDA's FAQ on the paxlovid EUA. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  
- The official letter from the FDA's acting chief scientist, granting the EUA.  <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>
