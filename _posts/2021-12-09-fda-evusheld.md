Guess what?  Yesterday, the FDA gave Emergency Use Authorization to another COVID-19 medication,
Evusheld from AstraZeneca.  Yeah&hellip; I didn't know, either!  


## The FDA EUA'd what, now?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-09-fda-evusheld-ap-2.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="AP: evusheld" title="AP: evusheld" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization to Evusheld.  (Yeah, I also spelled it "-shield"
the first few times I tried to type it.  Terrible name, but then all drug names are
terrible to some degree.)  

Now, I'd never heard of this!  It's not like I spend my time browsing
[ClinicalTrials.gov](https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov), but I like to think I have _some_
idea what's [In the Pipeline](https://www.science.org/blogs/pipeline).  So to have this
pop up was a pleasant surprise.  

I searched the calendars of the FDA AMBAC and VRBPAC committees, and it's not there.  It
appears this is one of those instances where the FDA just went and made up its own mind,
without convening a panel of outside experts.  (Let's hope for paxlovid?  Hmm.)  Here are
the primary data sources:

- The _Associated Press_ reported yesterday <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> that the FDA
  has granted the EUA, and a few details as well as the snazzy box photo above.  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-09-fda-evusheld-az.jpg" width="400" height="230" alt="AstraZeneca: Press release announcing FDA EUA's long-lasting abs Evusheld" title="AstraZeneca: Press release announcing FDA EUA's long-lasting abs Evusheld" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- At about the same time, AstraZeneca issued a press release <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
  saying more or less the same thing, how proud they were of AZD7442, and how they wish
  we'd all call it by the new copyrighted name evusheld.  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-09-fda-evusheld-fda-1.jpg" width="400" height="197" alt="FDA: Press release announcing EUA for long-lasting monoclonal ab preventative" title="FDA: Press release announcing EUA for long-lasting monoclonal ab preventative" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- The FDA issued a  news release <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> giving lots of details
  without the corporate-speak, but with the government-speak and medical-speak.  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-09-fda-evusheld-fda-2.jpg" width="400" height="237" alt="FDA: Formal letter of Emergency Use Approval for Evusheld" title="FDA: Formal letter of Emergency Use Approval for Evusheld" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- Finally, in case you've never seen such a thing, there is the FDA's formal EUA 
  Letter. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  These are not simple documents, since they
  have lots of formal legal implications, and instruct the drug maker exactly what they
  can and cannot do, and what they can and cannot say about their new medication.  So it's
  10 pages of dense language.  


## Ok, what's it do?  

I waded through all that, so you don't have to.  Here are the high points:  

- This is an antibody therapy (actually 2 of them, tixagevimab and cigavimab, given as
  simultaneous shots).  
  - These abs target distinct, nonoverlapping, (relatively conserved?) portions of the
    SARS-CoV2 spike protein.  
  - Doing combination therapy (yay!) like this confers some robustness against mutation.
    None of the Omicron mutations relevant to evusheld neutralized it.  _In vitro_
    experiments show evushelt works against Delta and Mu, also.  
- Unlike other antibody therapies, these have been engineered to have a long lifetime in
  the body, like 6 months, maybe up to 12.  (I have no idea how that works, given that
  until today I didn't know it was possible.  Things move fast, or at least faster than
  me.  And that's a _good_ thing.)  
- It conveys 6 months or so of immunity, at a level of 77% efficacy.  That's not as good as
  vaccination, but it's _way better than nothing_ for people who can't be vaccinated.  
- It is for people who are so immunocompromised that vaccination is not an option.  That
  means cancer patients, organ transplant recipients, people taking immunosuppressants for
  RA, and so on.  
- That amounts to perhaps 2% &ndash; 3% of the US population; it might be different
  worldwide.  In the US, that's 6.6 &ndash; 9.9 million people.  
- It is _not_ approved for use as a therapeutic for people who already have COVID-19, nor
  is it approved as a prophylactic for people who have been exposed.  It is also _not_ for
  people who want to avoid vaccination.   
- __Specifically:__ It's authorized for&hellip;  
  - Adults &amp; children over 12 who mass at least 40kg (88lb),  
  - Who are _not_ currently infected with SARS-CoV2 virus &amp; have _not_ been recently
    exposed,  
  - Whose immune systems haven't (or probably won't?) respond to COVID-19 vaccination (as
    detailed in the fact sheet <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>), or
    have a history of severe allergic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccinations,
- The cost is around \$1000/dose, compared to \$30/dose for vaccination.  
- The trial (PROVENT <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>) had 3441 subjects getting evusheld
  and 1731 getting a placebo.  
  - I was unable to find the infection rates to confirm the efficacy of 77% or get
    confidence limits; apparently the results haven't beeen posted to ClinicalTrials.gov yet?!  
  - And since it appears not to have gone before one of the committees, I can't find their
    submission docs either.  It goes faster, but less transparently.  
- There were some rare, but serious cardiac events _slightly_ more frequently in the
  treatment arm.  Absent the actual counts of data, I can't confirm or deny statistical
  significance.  
- The US government has bought 700,000 doses, which it will distribute to the states
  _gratis_ and _pro rata_.  
- The FDA's formal letter granting EUA is about as long and complicated as you'd expect.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

It's probably not relevant to you personally, since it applies only to 2% &ndash; 3% of
the population.  On the other hand, it _is_ relevant to you personally, since we all owe
each other a mutual duty of care, and our immunocompromised brothers and sisters need
this.  

So&hellip; at least we're doing _that._
