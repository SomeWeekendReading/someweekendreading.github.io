Apparently there has been some unusual fan conduct at the World Cup?  


## WHO did WHAT, now?  

Here at Chez Weekend, we're not very sportsball-oriented.  But even we hear there's something
or other sportsball-related called the "World Cup" happening in some rather unappealing
middle eastern country.  And that there has been unusual fan behavior.  

With a sigh, we looked into it.  The sigh was because the usual "futbol hooligans"
disappoint us and lower our view of humanity.  Full of trepidation when we heard it involved
_Japanese_ fans, of whom we had high expectations, we saw this from the venerable Beeb:

</a>

(You may have to fuss with your VPN to see the video, since apparently the BBC has qualms
about international viewership, for some reason.)  

So it's come down to this: when people act decently and clean up their mess as a courtesy
to others, that's _news_ nowadays.  I dunno whether to cry from sadness that it's news, or
happiness that it happened.  

飛ぶ鳥 跡を 濁さず.  ("Tobutori ato wo nigosazu", or "Birds flying away don't leave a mess
behind.")  

Good advice for all of us.  

Well done, Japanese sportsball fans.
