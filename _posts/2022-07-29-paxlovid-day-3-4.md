Closing in on the 5th day of COVID, i.e., 4th day of paxlovid treatment.  


## Really kind of wish this were over  

Had a lot of fatigue, to the point of sleeping pretty much all day yesterday.  The Weekend
Editrix was worried about blood O2 levels dropping somewhat.  

Today&hellip; just tired.  Formally no fever, but there are sweats and chills anyway,
regardless of the thermometer.  

Two more doses of paxlovid left, then a couple days to find out if rebound is in the
cards.  

I gotta say: if it's this bad _with_ paxlovid, it was gonna whallop me _really_ hard without
paxlovid.
