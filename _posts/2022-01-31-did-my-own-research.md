Lots people say 'I did my own research' on subjects in which they are not sufficiently
educated to evaluate data, let alone form an independent opinion reliably.  Here's what
that sounds like to actual research scientists.  


## Who knew the CDC hired comedians?  In management?  

Our Main(e) Event today is from an epidemiologist who is the CDC director in Maine,
[Dr. Nirav Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirav_D._Shah).  

Now, the xenophobic sector of US Republicans (which as far as I can tell is nearly
_all_ of them) may demur at listening to a 'foreigner' with a name like 'Nirav Shah'.
I freely admit that Shah was in fact born in Wisconsin, but he seems to have overcome that
initial disadvantage, becoming both a doctor _and_ a lawyer.  You might want to listen to
him.  I know that I personally will shut up and listen when he talks about pandemics and
epidemics.  

As you may have noticed, [this last weekend we had a blizzard here in New England](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/30/metro/more-than-50000-remain-without-power-mass-following-saturdays-blizzard/).  While I was out renewing my snowblower pilot's license, Shah was imagining what the covidiots who say 'I did my own research' might have to say on the subject of blizzards:

See?  Told ya he was brilliant.  I didn't expect he'd _also_ be funny, though.  

The only thing missing is a suggestion to sprinkle ivermectin as a snow &amp; ice
melter.  Which makes
[approximately as much sense as ivermectin for COVID-19]({{ site.baseurl }}/ivermectin-takedowns/),
so why not?  (Whoops: spoke too soon!  One of the replies suggested self-prescribing some
ivermectin, and then peeing on the snow.  Yes, that's _much_ better&hellip;)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

So, yeah:  
- If you're ignorant enough to think that Googling your way around, promiscuously
  reading conspiracy theories is 'doing your own research'&hellip; then whatever you say
  sounds about as dumb as Shah's parody above.  
- If you then mix it with the tropes of right wing hysteria, you additionally sound like
  a victim of the Republican mind-control virus, spreading fascism through your mind.  
  
Hey, um&hellip; maybe _don't_ do that?  

Unless, of course, you're doing it like [XKCD #2515, from back on 2021-Sep-13](https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/2515:_Vaccine_Research), in which the obvious is laboriously and unreliably rediscovered:  
![Honestly feel a little sheepish about the time and effort I spent confirming 'yes, the vaccine helps protect people from getting sick and dying' but I guess everyone needs a hobby.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-01-31-did-my-own-research-XKCD-2515.png "Honestly feel a little sheepish about the time and effort I spent confirming 'yes, the vaccine helps protect people from getting sick and dying' but I guess everyone needs a hobby.")  

## Addendum 2022-Feb-05: New England snow divers  

People in the US look to New England when they think "crazy winter people".  Here in New
England, we look to Maine when _we_ think "crazy winter people".  

It has come to my attention that a fellow Mainiac wanted to thank Nirav Shah for all he's
done for public health in Maine, and did so in what I can only assume is the typical Maine
fashion:

I mean&hellip; [I love winter too]({{ site.baseurl }}/winter-beauty/), but I stand all amazed at the true professionals.
