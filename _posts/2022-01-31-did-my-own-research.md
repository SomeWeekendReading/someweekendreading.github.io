title: 'I Did My Own Research'&colon; What That Sounds Like

Lots people say 'I did my own research' on subjects in which they are not sufficiently
educated to evaluate data, let alone form an independent opinion reliably.  Here's what
that sounds like to actual research scientists.  


## Who knew the CDC hired comedians?  In management?  

Our Main(e) Event today is from an epidemiologist who is the CDC director in Maine,
[Dr. Nirav Shah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirav_D._Shah).  

Now, the paranoid sector of Republicans in the US (which as far as I can tell is nearly
_all_ Republicans) may demur at listening to a 'foreigner' with a name like 'Nirav Shah'.
I freely admit that Shah was in fact born in Wisconsin, but he seems to have overcome that
initial disadvantage, becoming both a doctor _and_ a lawyer.  You might want to listen to
him.  I know that I personally will shut up and listen when he talks about pandemics and
epidemics.  

As you may have noticed, this last weekend we had a blizzard here in New England.  While I
was out renewing my snowblower pilot's license, Shah was imagining what the covidiots who
say 'I did my own research' might sound like on the subject of blizzards:

    1/Welp, I spent last night continuing my research into the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blizzard2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#blizzard2022</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hoax?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#hoax</a>. <br><br>
    Thankfully, <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Twitter</a> and Facebook have helpful algorithms that pointed me in the direction of *real* experts who helped me round out my thinking.

See?  Told ya he was brilliant.  I didn't expect he'd _also_ be funny.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

So, yeah:  
- If you're ignorant enough to think that Googling your way around, promiscuously
  reading conspiracy theories is 'doing your own research'&hellip; then whatever you say
  sounds about as dumb as Shah's parody above.  
- If you then mix it with the tropes of right wing hysteria, you additionally sound like
  a victim of the Republican mind-control virus, spreading fascism through your mind.  
  
So&hellip; maybe _don't_ do that?
