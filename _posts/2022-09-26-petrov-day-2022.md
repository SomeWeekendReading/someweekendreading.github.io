Today the world _still_ did not end, for the 39th time in a row.  


## A Russian&hellip; Hero?  

These days, we don't think of Russians as heroes.  And there's good evidence for that
belief: the invasion of Ukraine, calling Ukrainians Nazis, the disinformation campaigns in
US politics, the beatings of their citizens, the politicians and business folk dying of
[Tall Building Syndrome](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2022/9/21/2124313/-Another-Russian-dies-from-Tall-Building-Syndrome),
the nuclear weapon threats,
and so on.  

But once in a while, it's worth remembering one's adversaries are people.  And occasionally
_heroic_ people, at that.  

The hero we remember today is [Stanislav Petrov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov):

    Just past midnight today in 1983, thanks to "a funny feeling in my gut," 44 year-old
	Lt. Col. Stanislav Petrov's calm assessment that a satellite warning of the launch of
	five US Minuteman ICBMs was a false alarm likely averted a catastrophic nuclear
	war. <a href="https://t.co/J5MrBr3XAO">https://t.co/J5MrBr3XAO</a>

He did the _right_ thing, not the thing he was asked.  We should celebrate this as a
virtue.  (As we have, here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads, a couple times
before: [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/petrov-day) and [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/petrov-day-2021/).)  

Petrov's action, 39 years ago, was to recognize that he was in an absurd, evil system that
would have ended humanity if allowed a loose rein.  He decided, at some personal peril, to
buck the system and correctly identified a false positive instead of a nuclear strike.  

He rebelled.  We get to continue to live.  

That's an _excellent_ trade.  


## How to Celebrate

Do
[something that does _not_ end the world](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KTEciTeFwL2tTujZk/lw-petrov-day-2022-monday-9-26),
but contributes to the long-term health of
humanity.  You pick whatever it is, your own flavor of [tikkun ha'olam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam).  

When you find yourself also embedded in an absurd, evil system&hellip; do _not_ obey.  Do
the right thing instead.
