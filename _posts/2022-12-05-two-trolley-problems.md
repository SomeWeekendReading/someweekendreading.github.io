Today I found 2 interesting takes on the Trolley Problem.  


## The What Problem?  

It's possible 1 or 2 of you haven't watched
[_The Good Place_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Place_(season_2)#ep19).  (Get on that,
would you?  Unlike most American television, it's actually worth your time.  Thanks to a
young millennial friend for recommending it to me, and _insisting._)  

The [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) was invented in a 1967
paper <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> by philosopher
[Philippa Foot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippa_Foot).   She
was discussing something called the "doctrine of double effect", or how to assess the
morality of actions that have both good and bad results.  The Wikipedia summary:  

> There is a runaway trolley barreling down the railway tracks. Ahead, on the tracks,
> there are five people tied up and unable to move. The trolley is headed straight for
> them. You are standing some distance off in the train yard, next to a lever. If you pull
> this lever, the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice
> that there is one person on the side track. You have two (and only two) options:  
> 
> 1. Do nothing, in which case the trolley will kill the five people on the main track.  
> 2. Pull the lever, diverting the trolley onto the side track where it will kill one person.  
>  
> Which is the more ethical option? Or, more simply: What is the right thing to do?  

The 2 actions both have good and bad consequences.  Variations on this problem let us
explore the nuances (and traps) of our utility functions.
[Increasingly absurd variations](https://neal.fun/absurd-trolley-problems/)
can really twist your mind around; see _The Good Place_ above for examples.  

As with all "problems", there is not really a clear solution.  If there were a solution,
after all, we wouldn't call it a problem!  

This, of course, does not stop people from trying.  Some of the "solutions" are brilliant,
and some are just silly.  Occasionally, they are both (click through to watch the video of
the "dual track drifting solution"):

</a>

This "solution" was, of course, immediately repurposed for other humor needs.  Here's one
about the complexity of programming, were often we don't have a bug when we know we really
_should_, and don't know _why_ (again click through to watch the video):

## The Weekend Conclusion  

Trolley Problems, even with their absurd variations, force us to confront what we value.
It's _hard_ to craft a utility function that accurately describes our values, while not
forcing us into doing something horrible.  

&hellip; while sometimes enjoying the surreal variations.  

(__NB:__ Comments still disabled; working on it.  Perhaps it'll defer the endless Russian
spammers.)
