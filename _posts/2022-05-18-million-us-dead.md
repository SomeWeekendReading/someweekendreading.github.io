[_Tone warning:_ Angry post.]  We reached yesterday a grim and disgraceful milestone in the US, having at
least 1 million COVID-19 dead.  And that's just the _official_ count.  


## Cumulative COVID-19 deaths around the world

From [_Our World in Data_](https://ourworldindata.org/) comes the terrible news that the
US now has &ge; 1 million _official_ COVID-19 deaths.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
(They repackage and visualize the _excellent_ COVID-19 data sourced from Johns Hopkins
University.) Shown here is the time course of cumulative deaths officially assigned to COVID-19 for
the US and several comparably developed nations.  (You can fiddle with the plot at 
_Our World in Data_ to choose which countries to include.)  Some curious facts to note:  
- The US is _dramatically_ higher.  Indeed, a bit of fiddling about on the _Our World in Data_
  reveals that the world has a total of a bit over 6 million _official_ COVID-19 deaths
  compared to the US at 1 million.  Think it through: the US has 4.25% of the world
  population, but 16% of the world official COVID-19 deaths.  We have 4x the death rate we should,
  if we had even vaguely sensible public health policy comparable to the rest of the world.  
- Most of the rest of the developed world clusters together; the US is clearly an outlier,
  and not in a good way.  


## Cumulative COVID-19 deaths, per million, around the world  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-owid-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-owid-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="279" alt="Ritchie, et al. @ OWiD: Cumulative confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million in some developed countries" title="Ritchie, et al. @ OWiD: Cumulative confirmed COVID-19 deaths per million in some developed countries" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Now, you might argue that this should be scaled by population: since the US has more
people than Japan, _of course_ there are more deaths in the US, right?  

Not really.  Here are the cumulative deaths _per million_ for the same countries, from the
same source at _Our World in Data._  While you might argue it's not _quite_ as awful, 2
brute force facts remain:  
- The US is still the worst case.  
- In comparison to Japan, where masking was never an issue, the US is _more than 10x worse._
  Having sane public health policy and the ability to follow it is _a survival matter._  

At the beginning of the pandemic, the Weekend Editrix had been contemplating a trip to
Japan to visit family.  Had she taken that trip and gotten stuck in Japan, she'd have been
far safer than by remaining here in the US.  (There would have been other issues, like
lapse of visa.  Other issues can be fixed; dying of COVID-19 could not.  So the trade-off
might have favored evacuating her to Japan if we'd known all this.  Fortunately, we could
isolate pretty well and got through it in the US quite well so far.)  


## Excess mortality: How do we know it's about COVID-19?  

We emphasize the above are _official_ deaths, because of the politicized crap dropped on
the subject by the right-wing denialists: "from COVID" _vs_ "with COVID", insistence on
pre-existing conditions, and so on.  As a result, _official counts are always underestimates._  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-excess-mortality-example.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-excess-mortality-example-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="283" alt="Our World in Data: Excess mortality example, US 2015-2022" title="Our World in Data: Excess mortality example, US 2015-2022" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
One way to probe a little closer to causality is to use something called the _excess mortality_
measure.  We'd like to know if, by comparing to recent years that are reasonably similar
_except for the pandemic_, we see differing death rates.  If so, then we are at least a
step closer to assigning the excess in deaths to whatever's different, i.e., COVID-19.  

The first plot here, explained at _Our World in Data_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
should give you the idea:  
- The 5 gray lines at the bottom represent years 2015-2019, showing weekly death rates in
  the US vs time.  
- While there's some intra-year variation (higher deaths in mid-winter, lower in
  mid-summer), the point is they are all _comparable:_ this is the "normal" baseline
  against which we compare the pandemic years.  
- The black line at the bottom shows what we would _predict_ for 2020, based on the
  baseline years of 2015-2019.  
- The red, purple, and (short) green lines show the _actual_ death rates for 2020, 2021,
  and the start of 2022.  The point here is that they are _different_, and _much higher_
  than either the prediction for 2020 or the baseline years 2015-2019.  
- That excess with respect to baseline is the _excess mortality_ for those years.  
- To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic is the main difference between 2020-2022 vs
  2015-2019 (e.g., no major wars directly involving the US) then we can largely attribute the
  excess mortality to COVID-19.  

The advantage of all this foofraw is that it _cannot lie:_ it does not depend on whether a
death certificate says "COVID-19" or not, nor does it depend on "with COVID-19" vs "from
COVID-19", nor does it depend on local right-wing governments refusing to report COVID-19
deaths&hellip; none of that.  It just counts deaths, which are always reported one way or
another.

The folks at _The Economist_ have made a machine-learning model to estimate the true
butcher's bill and its 95% confidence interval in the US (and rest of world,
_q.v._). <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  
- It says we probably hit 1 million US COVID-19 deaths late last year, around 2021-Dec-20.  
- We now should have around 1.21 million dead (95% CI: 1.17 - 1.32 million).  That is, the
  "official" estimate of 1 million is an understatement by about 21% (possibly as much as
  32%).  I'd have expected an even larger underestimate, but then I'm a cranky old man.  
- Note that this model was last updated 2022-May-08.  So while it is reasonably current,
  it's not up-to-date as of this exact day.  
  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-excess-mortality-owid.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-excess-mortality-owid-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="Giattino, et al. @ OWiD: Excess COVID-19 mortality in some developed countries" title="Giattino, et al. @ OWiD: Excess COVID-19 mortality in some developed countries" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The folks at _OWiD_ did something similar, computing just the central estimate without
confidence intervals, but doing so
for many countries.  Plotted here is the number of cumulative deaths for the US (a
depressingly large positive outlier) and the usual developed nations cited above.
- It also says we probably hit 1 million dead in early- to mid-January, roughly comparable to what the
  model from _The Economist_ predicted above.  
- It says we have about a 10% underestimate of US deaths, somewhat more optimistic than _The
  Economist_'s model above.  
- Note, however, that the excess mortality in Japan is _negative:_ they all became very
  cautious and adopted near-universal masking.  Probably this stopped influenza or
  something in its tracks along with COVID-19, so they actually have had _fewer_ than
  expected deaths in the pandemic years.  
- I absolutely do _not_ understand the little dip in the US curve at the right-hand end!
  As a _cumulative_ curve, it must be monotone nondecreasing, so something's odd there.  
- Also note this model was last updated early May, so it's almost a month or so behind.  


## Excess mortality &amp; underestimates around the world  

So the US has glaring underestimates of COVID-19 deaths, though not as bad as I'd feared.  

What about the rest of the world?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-economist-row.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-economist-row-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="293" alt="The Economist: Official world COVID-19 excess mortality underestimated by ~3.4 fold" title="The Economist: Official world COVID-19 excess mortality underestimated by ~3.4 fold" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-excess-mortality-economist-world.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-excess-mortality-economist-world.jpg" width="400" height="289" alt="The Economist: Official world COVID-19 excess mortality underestimated by ~3.4 fold" title="The Economist: Official world COVID-19 excess mortality underestimated by ~3.4 fold" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The model from _The Economist_ says:  
- Official estimates are only 6.26 million dead world-wide.  
- The excess mortality model says around 21.18 million dead (95% CL: 14.74 - 25.07 million)!  
- So the official estimates are _underestimates by a factor of 3.38 (95% CL: 2.35 - 4.00)._
- Note that this model was last updated early in 2022-May when we last checked it.  It is quite
  current, though not this exact day.  

The degree of worldwide underestimate of the total deaths here is just stunning.  

This may slightly undermine our case above that the US has been _uniquely_ incompetent.
Unfortunately, it does not make the US look any better, but just makes everyone else look
worse.  

These grievous times are not those for which we, or anyone, were hoping.  (_"Tempus adest __dolorum,__ hoc quod __non__ optibamus",_ as [the old song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudete) most definitely does _not_ go!)  


## Yeah, but what could we have done?

From Philip Bump in the _WaPo_ comes a report that about 1/4 of the million now dead could
have been prevented by vaccination alone.  <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  He's
reporting on an update of some Peterson/KFF research by Amin, 
_et al._  <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  
- The first plot here shows the number of US COVID-19 deaths each month.  
  - The gray bars, especially in the beginning, are not avoidable with vaccines (mostly
    because vaccines were then not yet widely available).  
  - The but when the bars start to turn purple, we have widely available vaccines that
    were widely refused&hellip; and those people became widely dead.  _Avoidably._  
  - __NB:__ The rightmost month, 2022-Apr, had incomplete data at the time and is therefore all gray.  
- The second plot here shows it gets worse with time: while the overall fraction of
  preventable deaths is about 25% (including the early months when there was no vaccine),
  the more recent months are just vile.  _About 60% of recent deaths were preventable,_
  had people only had the wit to ignore disinformation and get vaccinated!  

Bump goes on to point out that this isn't just the average American bungling of COVID-19.
It is very specifically Republican-caused death:

And that's _just with vaccination._  Imagine if we had all played by the rules of public
health policy: worn masks in public, avoided unforced public gatherings, isolated when
testing positive, self-reported cases, and so on.  

Spreaders of disinformation have murdered _at least_ a quarter million in the US.  Likely
more, when you consider the degree to which they've undermined other public health measures.
Likely more to come, when you consider how they've undermined confidence in vaccination
against childhood diseases.  

So&hellip; yeah, we _could have done something,_ but were prevented by malignant
right-wing zealots.  Like some malignancies, I fear this one may be terminal for American
democracy and prosperity.

I mean, it could be worse: both Eritrea and North Korea have used
_no vaccines at all._ <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  The Eritreans at least have the
excuse of being continually in a state of near complete meltdown.  The North Koreans, on the other
hand, have _refused_ donations of vaccines because they're continually in a state of near complete
authoritarian insanity.  US conservative politics, with its fact-free idolatry of Trump
and his eerily similar authoritarianism, is beginning to resemble North Korean fact-free
idolatry of Kim.  


## Some perspectives  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-stat-1.jpg" width="400" height="177" alt="Parker @ STAT: 5 phases of pandemic to 1 million dead" title="Parker @ STAT: 5 phases of pandemic to 1 million dead" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-stat-2.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-stat-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="426" alt="Parker @ STAT: Heatmap of mortality: time x states" title="Parker @ STAT: Heatmap of mortality: time x states" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Emory Parker, writing at _STAT News_ <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>, has attempted to
use public health data to give us a short history of the pandemic in 5 phases.  We won't
go through every detail of his article here, but some highlights are worth reviewing (if
only in order to tempt you to read the whole piece):  
- First is a very informative [heatmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map).
  - At the top is the rate of dying over time.  You clearly see the wave structue, and
    appreciate that winter 2020-2021 was really bad, as were fall 2022 and winter
    2021-2022.  
  - Below that is a color grid: rows are still time (aligned with the death rate plot),
    and the vertical axis is for each US state (from west to east; I would prefer for them
    to have been [hierarchically clustered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering)
    &ndash; as is customary in heatmaps &ndash; to uncover state similarities, but a geographic
    sort is sort of ok).  
  - The color in each cell indicates the death rate at that place and time; the color key
    is at the bottom.  
  - You can clearly see a number of features:  
    - The initial peak in early 2020 in NYC is just awful.  This inspired several
      conservative acquaintances of mine to opine, "Those coastal cities are getting
      slammed" as if it were somehow a liberal problem.  The Trump administration actually
      decided not to act, since the states with other countries didn't vote for them
      anyway.  
    - Then you can see the clear wave structure.  Also, you can see why summer 2021 was
      such a hopeful time, though it turned out to be just a lull between waves.  
	- Also, some waves didn't cover the whole country: fall 2021 was primarily in the
      conservative west and south, but never made it to the east coast where stringent
      public health guidelines were more likely respected.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-stat-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-18-million-us-dead-stat-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="237" alt="Parker @ STAT: Vaccinated vs unvaccinated death rates, once vaccines were available" title="Parker @ STAT: Vaccinated vs unvaccinated death rates, once vaccines were available" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Next, the point is _sharply_ made that this is a pandemic of the _unvaccinated_, almost
  solely:  
  - The horizontal axis is, of course, time.  The vertical axis is death rates per 100,000
    people.  
  - The 3 curves are for the unvaccinated (high death rate), vaccinated (low death rate),
    and boosted (very low death rate) populations.  
  - The dramatic, vivid, and obvious conclusion: the willfully unvaccinated are at fault
    for almost all deaths since mid-2021, when vaccines became widely available.
    Remaining unvaccinated is volunteering to die, and attempting to bring down the rest
    of socieity with you.  
	
In other words: _it didn't have to be this bad, except that we were stupid._  

There's a lot more in Parker's article, including a subtle point about age groups
(COVID-19 didn't kill as many young people because young people die less frequently from
_everything_, but it _did_ become one of the leading causes of deaths among the young;
rural areas resisted vaccination and thus had _loads_ more people dying as a consequence;
poverty is a risk factor for _everything_; US health insurance is _terrible_; and so on).  

His conclusion (emphasis in original):  

> These five patterns show __how__ SARS-CoV-2 exacted a toll few could have imagined in the
> spring of 2020. The __why__ of one million is a story of both scientific achievement which
> saved some lives and of systemic failures which cost far too many. Of heroism and
> sacrifice beset by distrust and partisanship. Of collective action weighed against
> individual risk and responsibility.

> &hellip;

> with us.

Finally, a news article by Ewen Callaway in the respected journal _Nature_ <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>
gives us an idea of what's happening with SARS-CoV2 viral evolution and the resulting COVID-19 surges.
He's using data from CoVariants/NextStrain <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> to make the
point that viral evolution is happening because not enough people are vaccinated, with the
result that some new strains evolve to cause new waves of misery and death.  

The [proximate cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation) of
the article is the emergence of the BA.4 and BA.5 strains in South Africa.  Where
vaccination is low, viral mutations will happen.  That's causing another wave in Africa,
which will spread around the world soon.  

Why?  Because the virus is evolving!  Shown here is the cladogram ("family tree", more or
less) of the various more widespread SARS-CoV2 variants.  (There are thousands more; these
are the ones that got serious notice because they were widespread and threatening.)  Time
proceeds left to right.  The root of the tree on the left is the original Wuhan strain.
The rest is mostly our fault for failing containment, public health, and vaccination.  

When you see a cladogram like this &ndash; frantically growing sideways to be very bushy,
then all branches except one dying out &ndash; that's a sign of evolution in action.  The
bushiness is rapid mutation and formation of new variants.  The single surviving line is
rapid environmental selection for the "best" spreader (i.e., the "worst" for humanity).

## The Weekend Conclusion  

We should be ashamed, but I doubt we will be.  Our capacity for shame has been too
severely impaired.  One must first have the knowledge of what's correct, and then acknowledge
a fault with respect to that knowledge, in order to experience shame.  

The malign influence of conservative politics may have made us too stupid to survive.  And so:
here we are, dying.  More than we can even admit to each other.

Holden Thorp in the respected journal _Science_ <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>,
conveys some of the frustration scientists are feeling with people's decisions to ignore
the pandemic and pretend it's over.  That's called _giving up and dying._  (Note that while
writing this editorial, Thorp himself got COVID-19, and began taking paxlovid.)  Let's let Thorp's
last paragraph have the last word here (with a bit of __emphasis__ from your humble Weekend Editor):  

> SARS-CoV-2 is rapidly mutating and recombining, and more variants and subvariants
> &ndash; potentially more pathogenic &ndash; are on the horizon. The world is still
> barely vaccinated, and even in wealthy countries like the United States, resources are
> inequitably distributed. __It absolutely ain't over.__ And this is no time to drop the ball.
