This week I voted in the 2024 election.  


## Voting by Mail  

I hope all Americans eligible to vote realize that this is definitely the most serious
election of our lifetimes, and arguably ever in US history.  Nothing less than domestic
fascism is on the horizon.  

### Ballot Sent

So I have been waiting with bated breath (and occasionally, after sushi, baited breath)
the arrival of my mail-in ballot.  By voting by mail _and checking the status on the
Secretary of the Commonwealth's web site,_ I can avoid any election day hijinks and ensure
my ballot is properly submitted.  

So, as you can see here, I was excited to note that the ballots were mailed out on
2024-Oct-07.  (The previous ballot shown was a late Democratic primary,
[in which I previously voted]({{ site.baseurl }}/voter-reg-2024/#how-your-humble-weekend-editor-checked-registration).
Mostly unopposed candidates, except for delegate to Governor's Council.  Like everybody
else, I have little idea what that is, and guessed the incumbent might know what she's doing.)  

### Ballot Received &amp; Filled Out  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-10-voting-2024-ballot.jpg" width="400" height="913" alt="Federal portion of my ballot: Democrats for president, senate, and house" title="Federal portion of my ballot: Democrats for president, senate, and house" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
My ballot arrived promptly on 2024-Oct-08, the next day.  

I filled it out, with the Federal portion as shown here: Democrats for the presidency, the
Senate, and the House.  It really takes a trifecta to root out the fascists:
- If Republicans control the House, they will just continue to block legislation, shut
  down the government with debt limit showdowns, and try to impeach everybody in sight.  
- If Republicans control the Senate, they will block any appointments they can, especially
  including the Supreme Court.  

So&hellip; Democrats at the federal level.  

Now, there was a great deal more on the ballot: a plethora of local offices with peculiar
New England names, a number of ballot initiatives, and so on.  Those are not of wide
interest, unless you also happen to live in my town!  The relevant portion is the federal
portion shown here, and the admonition to vote Democratic for president, senate, and
representative.  

Please do not vote for any Republican, for any imaginable office, under any conceivable
circumstance.  They have become _de facto_ fascists, and must re-form another party to set
foot on the road to credibility.  Also: please do not vote 3rd party or abstain from
voting.  Both of those do _not_ "send a message" other than "I don't care".  They amount
to half a vote for Trump and the end of American democracy.  

### Ballot Delivered  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-10-voting-2024-ballot-drop-box.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Ballot going into the town clerk's drop box" title="Ballot going into the town clerk's drop box" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
With that, I folded the ballot up, put it in the Very Special Envelope.  I then signed,
dated and sealed the VSE, putting it in the _other_ envelope for mailing.  

Remember the last election, when
[Trump's Postmaster General Louis DeJoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_DeJoy)
attempted sabotage of mail-in voting by crippling blue state post offices with the removal
and destruction of mail sorting machines?  Yeah, that guy's still around.  

So while there's little danger of such a problem here in Massachusetts, I'm a (retired)
professional suspicious bastard.  So I walked past the post office, and went the extra
couple blocks to the Town Hall.  Here you see me stuffing the ballot envelope into the
official ballot drop box run by the Town Clerk.  

Last election, there were instances of armed MAGAs obstructing drop boxes.  They would
allege they were "protecting" the ballots, and "checking" the citizenship of anyone
depositing a ballot.  In practice, it was armed intimidation of voters.  I saw no such
thing here in Deep Blue New England, thankfully.  I didn't spot the surveillance cameras,
though (for once) I hope there were several.  It probably helped (for once) to be across
the street from the police department.  

### Ballot Accepted?  

Now comes the waiting game.  

The Town Clerk's people probably empty that drop box once a day.  They then scan the
(sealed) ballot envelope with its bar code, and deposit the ballot in a safe to be counted
on election day.  They report the receipt of the ballot up to the office of the Secretary
of the Commonwealth.  The Secretary's web site updates its database every 2 hours.  

So&hellip; time to wait for all that to happen.  We're looking for the state of my ballot
to change from "Not Returned" to a date, and for the status to move to "Accepted".
"Accepted" means it's all been checked and it's ready to be counted.  

Refresh&hellip; refresh &hellip; refresh&hellip;  

It feels like it's 2021 and we're all refreshing browser windows looking for vaccination
appointments.

Finally, at 4:37pm today, the Secretary of the Commonwealth's web site says my ballot
is received in good order and ready for counting.  

Done!  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-10-voting-2024-relax.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-10-10-voting-2024-relax.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher stand down from action stations." title="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher stand down from action stations." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Yes, I'm still very tense about the election.  But the tension has gone down a _little,_
because I know I've done my part.  Now I worry that everyone else needs to go and do their
part.  

The Weekend Publisher and his Assistant Weekend Publisher, as shown here, are a bit more
practical.  Now that I have voted as they instructed, under penalty of claw, they are
willing to stand down from action stations.  (It also helps that I have fed them.)  

There are still many steps ahead of us:  
- The actual election on Nov 5, ironically on Guy Fawkes Day.  
- The counting of the ballots, without armed Republican goons intimidating officials.  
- The certification of counts, without the promised interference from local Republican
  officials.  
- The state certification of counts, without the promised interference from Republican
  governors.  
- The formation of, and performance of, Electoral College slates, without illegal
  "alternative" slates Republicans tried last time.  
- The Congressional certification of the Electoral College results, without Republican
  insurrection and political violence as seen last time.  
- The inauguration and swearing-in of Harris and Walz, which I imagine will be under
  stupendously tight security.  
  
And finally, the return of Trump to court, for my favorite step yet to come: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)

Nope.
