As of today, the esteemed Weekend Editrix is 2 weeks past her 2nd dose of the Pfizer
vaccine, and thus as fully immunized as it's possible to be right now.  At 3pm EDT, she is
officially out of COVID jail!  Well, more or less&hellip;   


## What it (still!) means once you're fully vaccinated  

Recall that a vaccine efficacy of 95% means that we now have 5% of the probability/unit
time of getting COVID-19 as an unvaccinated person in similar exposure circumstances:  

$$
\mbox{efficacy} = 100.0 * \left( 1 - \frac{\Pr(\mbox{infection} | \mbox{vax})}{\Pr(\mbox{infection} | \mbox{non-vax})} \right)
$$

But&hellip; the new variants (especially the British, Brazilian, and South African) are
apparently much _more_ contagious.  So even if the vaccine is equally efficacious on them,
our risk would still be 5% of a larger number.  And it appears the vaccines still have
efficacy, but it might be lowered.  (Though the efficacy at preventing hospitalization
&amp; death might still be impressively high.)  


## Herd immunity  

So the risk isn't really removed until we reach herd immunity.  And, as we've seen, there
are [people diligently working to make sure that cannot possibly be attained]({{ site.baseurl }}/republicans-vs-herd-immunity/).  

Also, the virus isn't exactly sitting still.  With each variant, we're seeing mutations in
the receptor binding doman (RBD) that increase affinity to human ACE2.  This increases the
$R_0$, so ability of the virus to spread goes up.  The fraction of the population required
to be vaccinated or otherwise immune also goes up:  

$$
p \geq 1 - \frac{1}{R_0}
$$

Given how we're struggling to get people to overcome superstitious fear of vaccines
already, a higher $R_0$ just raises the bar even higher.  Personally, I'm putting it at
about 60% probability there will be booster shots required for the variants either in the
fall or early next year (2021-Q3 to 2022-Q1, if you want to hold me to it and check).  

So we still haven't booked tickets to my favorite [Club Med in the Bahamas](https://www.clubmed.us/r/columbus-isle/y).  It's closed until December 2020 anyway.  Maybe then?  

In the meantime, the Weekend Editrix's mother in Japan has gotten her first dose of
Pfizer.  So I foresee at trip to Japan in the summer (at least for the Weekend Editrix,
given exhorbitant air travel prices right now!).
