People are clamoring for an end to "restrictions", by which they mean masks and closures.
And, of course, vaccination mandates.  They're eager to be done with COVID-19, whether
COVID-19 is done with them or not.  Does _any_ of that make sense?  Well&hellip; _some_ of
it&hellip; _maybe._  


## NPIs, Vaccinations, and Political Blinders

Do NPI's (non-pharmaceutical interventions, like masks) work?  From the _New York Times_
this morning comes an article by David Leonhardt <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> about
the American right-wing suspicion that "masks don't work". (They also think "vaccines
don't work" &ndash; in spite of 90%+ efficacy, so you should conclude that their opinions
are largely evidence-free.)  They're so eager to be done with COVID-19, that several
Republican governors last year went so far as to _ban_ mask mandates, even going so far as
to sue school districts that required masks. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> At the time
last year, that was about as smart as banning parachutes among skydivers.  

Is it any better now?  Leonhardt tries to answer that question.  


## A Natural Experiment  

It's true that life in Red America and Blue America are very different for many reasons,
but in particular different in COVID-19 attitudes.  In-restaurant dining, returns to
workplaces, school re-openings, and dropping masks are much higher in red areas than blue
areas.  We already know
[from deeply and completely damning evidence]({{ site.baseurl }}/masterful-data-journalism/)
that red areas resist, defy, and deny vaccination (and even testing!) as well.  This
invites, as Leonhardt points out, what philosophers and economists call a
["natural experiment"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment): does the fact
that our natures have segregated our behavior into such different groups show up in the
COVID-19 statistics?

As with so many things in the real world, the answer is both "yes" and "no", depending on
_exactly_ how yo decide to look.  The _NYT_ data summarizes the situation with respect to
daily case rates per capita and death rates per capita:
- These graphs are from 2021-Dec-01 to this week, so they _only cover the Omicron variant_, 
  which is the most seriously contagious variant.  Only measles is worse, at least to my
  knowledge.  
- The rates are stratified by Trump vote share (low in blue, medium in gray, high in
  red).  
- Both the horizontal and vertical scales are the same throughout, so visual comparison
  among the graphs is totally allowed.  
- I don't know why they chose to show only Georgia, Ohio, Washington, and Texas, other
  than space restrictions.  More complete US data for all areas is available at 
  [the _Times_'s interactive COVID-19 case database](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html),
  which is quite a wonderful resource.  

What should we conclude from these data?  Several things:  
- The case rates are not materially different between the Trumpy and non-Trumpy groups,
  despite differences in mask use.  This is not because masks don't work, but rather
  because Omicron is _so infectious_ that it will eventually overwhelm masks.  Masks can
  slow down Omicron at best, and these data only cover the period favorable to Omicron.  
- The death rates are dramatically &ndash; and _drearily_ &ndash; different!  This is
  almost entirely due to differences in vaccination.  Vaccination will prevent many
  infections, and drastically lower the severity of the few that get through.  Again, like
  parachutes: they won't prevent you from falling out of an airplane, but they make the
  experience survivable. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

Leonhardt interviewd Christopher Murray of University of Washington, who predicted this.
He said that it's as if you had to roll a die each time you go to a public indoor venue to
see if you get COVID-19.  With a mask, you get COVID-19 if you roll a 1; without a mask,
you get COVID-19 if you roll a 1 or a 2.  So masks work: they cut the probability per unit
time of infection by a factor of 2.  But with Omicron it's still so high, that the virus
rips through the population anyway.  Whether you live or die is driven by vaccination.  


## Leonhardt's Conclusion

> If a new variant emerges, and hospitals are again at risk of being overwhelmed, then
> reinstating Covid restrictions may make sense again, despite their modest effects. But
> that’s not where the country is today.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Broadly speaking, we agree here at Chez Weekend.  We're a little leery of dropping NPIs,
since they _do_ stop needless deaths.  The counter-argument is that people don't like
masks (with which we agree) and that masking causes psychological damage (which we don't
really see).  Still, Leonhardt shows us data that says vaccination and boosting are
important, and now masking is less so.

(Details on the picture: [2021-Oct-30, in this crummy little blog that nobody reads]({{ site.baseurl }}/partisan-covid-deaths/#the-partisan-divide-in-npis).)  

We're a bit wary of pandemic fatigue driving us to engage in
[motivated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_reasoning)
to conclude that we should do what we want to do anyway.  That was certainly the case in
the 1918 flu pandemic in the US, as shown in a marvelous historical article by Emily
Martin in _National Geographic_ this mongh. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  People
really wanted it to be over, so just acted as if it were so &ndash; at the cost of
prolonging infections for _years_ into the 1920s, and an absolutely steadfast
determination not to remember.  Why do you think you studied World War I in school, but
not the 1918 flu pandemic that killed more people?  Selective blindness is why!

So&hellip; we'll continue to mask, but try to control our rage at seeing unmasked people,
or idiots wearing masks beneath their noses.  For now.  I promise I'll personally try not
to glare at people like Bela Lugosi does here, playing Dracula.  At least I'll _try._
