Trump continues to antagonize the world at large, and weaken America's fiscal posture with
destructive tax cuts.  Some international leaders are threatening a sell-off in US
Treasury bonds.  Here's our (small) defensive reaction in the Weekend Portfolio.  


## If the World Sells US Treasuries&hellip;  

US Treasury bonds, and their inflation-protected cousins, TIPS, were widely regarded as
the safest investments in the world.  However, the US is behaving _so_ badly, many foreign
holders of our debt have begun thinking what was previously unthinkable: selling off their
stocks of Treasuries.  Mostly that's been just talk in the past.  After all, taking down
the US debt market would likely cause a world-wide Depression that nobody wants.  But the
US now such a menace to itself and others, that seems like the _reasonable_ move!  

Two recent articles show some ominous cracks in the dam.

A small-ish Danish pension fund, AkademikerPension, says it's going to dump \\$100 million
in US bonds by February, i.e., now.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> Now, true, that's
not much compared to the size of the debt market.  But considering how conservative
European pension funds are, and how unthinkable this would have been just a year ago, it's
a _very_ significant early warning.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-07-weekend-portfolio-trump-4-reuters-1.jpg" width="400" height="182" alt="Reuters staff: Swedish pension fund Alecta selling off US Treasury bonds" title="Reuters staff: Swedish pension fund Alecta selling off US Treasury bonds" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Not at all coincidentally, the Swedish pension fund Alecta says it has _already_ sold of
almost all of its Treasuries, amounting to \\$7.7 &ndash; \\$8.8 billion.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  Again, that's not a huge amount, but the first
signs of huge moves are always small.  

Yes, this is an early reaction from a couple of pension funds which, after all, are rather
small.  But that's how an avalanche starts: first just a small bit, then all at once.  So
we want to have in place measures which are (a) defensive against a decline in US
Treasuries &amp; TIPS, and (b) not _too_ destructive to overall return.  


## How Can We Defend Against _That?_  

Not defending Trump, of course: he deserves all he can get in terms of world leaders
metaphorically slapping him around.  Rather, how can we defend our portfolio which relies
heavily on US Treasuries &amp; TIPS for its bond sector?  

This is a bit like asking how individuals can defend their homes in case of nuclear war.
A US debt collapse would be _so_ disastrous that we can't really do much at all.  Still,
perhaps we can do _something_ to hold off the damage in case there's a reaction against
the US debt that is very bad in itself, but not a total collapse.  As we've written
previously on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR) <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>,
our neutral policy portfolio would be a bog-standard set of index funds, spread all around
the world, at a 60% stocks and 40% bonds ratio, using US Treasuries &amp; TIPS as the bond
portion.  

In a series of steps, encouraged by public advice from Vanguard, we had moved to a 40/60
allocation:  
- 40% stocks / 60% bonds  
- 40% US / 60% international in stocks and REITS  

But within the stock sector, we remained 60% capitalization-weighted total market index
funds to 40% "tilts" to small-cap and small-cap value funds.  Those tilts importantly both
capture the Fama-French model premia, and tilt us away from US large-cap big-tech AI bets,
which look like sheer lunacy to me.  

Also, just because we're a bit conservative, we remained 50% US Treasury &amp; TIPS / 50%
international bonds.  The Vanguard International Bond Index fund
([VTABX](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtabx)) is
intriguing: it's mostly government bonds of developed nations, and has a currency hedge
back to the dollar to eliminate currency risk.  So it looks pretty much like Treasuries,
just someone else's Treasury backing it up.  

It's that last bit that we want to address now, _before_ any hostility to Treasuries
builds up.

In response to the world-wide, and generally well deserved, hostility to US Treasuries, we
decided to move the bond sector of our portfolio to 40% US Treasuries &amp; TIPS / 60%
international dollar-hedged bonds.  
- As you can see here in the first couple pie charts, our overall tax location and asset
  allocation haven't changed much.  

  We're still investing in the same broad asset classes in about the same way, with
  continuing effort to Roth convert funds to be more tax-free in the future.  
- The changes come when you look at the bond portion of the allocation in the next table
  (the lines with the orange cells, labeled "Bonds").  

  Here we've cut back to smaller allocations to intermediate Treasuries &amp; TIPS, and
  expanded the foreign bonds.  
- Just to be sure, I got another opinion by using Vanguard's portfolio tools to get a
  snapshot of the resulting allocation.  I might be _wrong_ about the future, but I don't
  want to _blunder_ in how I prepare for it!  

  Vanguard's tool confirms that we've done approximately what we intended, and that our
  expense ratio is a comfortingly low 10bp.  

So now our portfolio is even more armor-plated against world hostility to Treasuries.
We're probably sacrificing some return.  That's acceptable, a bit like paying an insurance
premium to off-load a risk.  As Vanguard claimed in their advice, the 40/60 portfolio
should have almost exactly the same return over the next 10 years as the 60/40 portfolio,
but with dramatically less risk.  

We now stand at:  
- 40% stocks / 60% bonds  
- 40% US / 60% international in stocks, REITs, _and_ now also in bonds  
- 60% cap-weighted total market index funds / 40% tilts to small and small-value index
  funds, within the stock sector.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Keep in mind, this is not investment advice.  I'm (a) unaware of your particular
situation, and (b) neither competent, licensed, nor inclined to give investment advice.  

It's just a description of what we're doing to cope with retirement.  

_Caveat investor._
