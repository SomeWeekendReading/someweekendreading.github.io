You all are scaring me, with your science denying, mask refusing, socially close quarters,
holiday travelling ways.  C'mon: wear a mask, socially distance, avoid indoor gatherings,
get a flu shot.  At least _pretend to try_ you want to live until the vaccine is
available, ok?  Then maybe you won't randomly kill the rest of us, who _do_ want to live.  

People are behaving stupidly <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>: not wearing masks (or
wearing them maliciously, e.g., _under_ their noses), traveling for holidays, going to parties,
not getting flu shots, agitating _against_ vaccines for _anything_&hellip; And that
doesn't even begin to cover it &ndash; I can barely believe the sack-of-hammers crazy
stuff I've heard people say in all somber seriousness.  


## Death rates  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-28-youre-scaring-me-JAMA-COVID-US-leading-cause-of-death.jpg" width="400" height="188" alt="JAMA: COVID-19 is now the leading cause of death in the US" title="JAMA: COVID-19 is now the leading cause of death in the US" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/> 
It's all starting to terrify me, because this level of stupidity is often a capital crime
in the court that enforces the laws of nature.  A
[_Journal of the American Medical Association_](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama)
editorial by 3 public health experts <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> notes that COVID-19
is now the _leading cause of death in the US!_  Worse than cancer.  Worse than heart
disease.  It's been an age since that was true of an infectious disease.  They note the
current US death rate is equivalent to 15 plane crashes a day, each killing 150
passengers.  It's like having a 9/11 event every day and a half.  It could even be up to
about 50% worse due to reporting delays, coding mistakes, and general pandemic overload in
the healthcare system.  Their conclusion:  
> The need for the entire population to take the disease seriously—notably to wear masks and maintain social distance—could not be more urgent.  

Indeed.  


## Case rates  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-28-youre-scaring-me-NYT-US-cases-vs-time.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="CDC: US COVID-19 cases vs time" title="CDC: US COVID-19 cases vs time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-28-youre-scaring-me-CDC-US-cases-vs-time.jpg" width="400" height="290" alt="NYT: US COVID-19 cases vs time" title="NYT: US COVID-19 cases vs time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Some graphics from the _New York Times_ and the CDC agree: the third wave in the US is
viscious.  I've carefully sourced the data from 2 places here, both with extremely good
reputations, just to avoid criticism that I'm using doubtful data in an inflammatory way.
I'm using _good_ data, in I hope a _good_ way; the information _itself_ is inflammatory.  

It was frightening in the spring.  It was annoying in the summer (though in New
England we seem to have skipped that one, thankfully).  It's _infuriating_ now: how can
people not have been paying attention?!  

Note the structure in that 3rd peak: see the bump up in case rates in December?  That's
the beginning of the payment in misery and deaths for reckless Thanksgiving gatherings.
All of which was _avoidable_ by minor behavior changes that public health people have been
shouting at the top of their lungs for months now.  Avoidable misery.  Avoidable deaths.  

A joke I found initially amusing, but now just depressing:  
- American: "We're going to have to retire the phrase 'avoid that like the plague',
  because it turns out people don't do that."  
- European: "You mean _American people_ don't do that."  
- American: "Ok, _Republican American people_ don't do that."  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-28-youre-scaring-me-NYT-US-cases-per-capita-by-county.jpg" width="400" height="307" alt="NYT: US COVID-19 cases per 100,000 by county" title="NYT: US COVID-19 cases per 100,000 by county" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
When you break it down geographically, this county-by-county map from the _NYT_ shows that
there are definite hot spots.  

You can slice &amp; dice these data in a number of ways, but right now I'm glad that here
at Chez Weekend we're comparatively safe in New England.  I say _comparatively_ because of
course we are not safe: there's plenty of COVID-19 here. Just not the nightmare of the
South, or southern California.  

So all the numbers in that _JAMA_ editorial are even more damning.  We don't just have a
high death rate, we have geographically concentrated high death rates.  Why then, are all
the red states not yelling for help because our government is hanging them out to dry with
little to no public health support?  I really don't get it.  Were I prone to conspiracy
theories, I'd tend to theorize that somebody is trying to lower the population in the
conservative states, and has somehow gotten them to buy into their own deaths.  _It makes
no sense._  


## Not _just_ 'your body, your choice': you live with the rest of us  

"My body, my choice" is a phrase I keep hearing from people who resist masks, and even
resist vaccines.  (I wonder if they know they're re-using a slogan originated in defense of
abortion rights?)  I have great sympathy for this viewpoint, as in people should be in
charge of their own bodies and that's a reasonable argument in favor of abortion.  

But in the case of COVID, this is just _incoherent_.  The disease is _infectious_.  You
may make some idiotic decision that increases your personal COVID risk, but of
course you are also going to pass on COVID to those around you.  That's what "infectious"
_means_.  Reckless behavior risks not just your own health, but assaults the health of
everyone else.  (It's also dumb as a box of hair.)  

[Olivier Blanchard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Blanchard) makes this case using
data in France.  It appears the age 20-29 cohort lost control in July and got infected.  Too bad
for them, but it's their own fault and they're young anyway so they won't face severe
consequences, right?  Wrong: they of course infected everyone else over  period of time,
and caused many needless deaths among their elders.  Why kill grandma?

    A fascinating graph, showing the dynamics of the second wave in France. <br><br>

    Things were fine in July, but the 20-29 year olds starting relaxing.<br><br>

    Over time, they contaminated older generations until infection rates were high for all. <br><br>


    How will the reverse movement proceed?

A similar sentiment from 
[Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus ("Dr Tedros")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Adhanom),
Director-General of the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/), rather mildly
expressed the truism that, in matters of public health, no one is safe until everyone is
safe.  As the price for this rather obvious bit of wisdom, he was dragged over the coals by
covidiots in the Twitter responses (not reproduced here, because they're too infuriating).  

_How can something this obvious be denied by people competent to operate a keyboard?!_ In matters of public health, especially infectious diseases, we _are_ in fact all in it together.  Our death rates can only be controlled by collective action, not individual action.

## Oy, vey: why _do_ we even bother?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-28-youre-scaring-me-Globe-US-public-health-despair.jpg" width="400" height="409" alt="Boston Globe: US public health experts despair" title="Boston Globe: US public health experts despair" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
It's enough to make your humble Weekend Editor despair.  

Rather more unfortunately, the
venerable _Globe_ reports that many public health experts and healthcare providers are
_also_ in a state of despair: as in "why the hell we even bother" trying to save lives
when all we get back is ignorant contempt. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

> "At almost every step of this pandemic, we have failed magnificently as a country," the Harvard scientist [Professor of epidemiology Michael Mina] said Monday. "And in ways that we just really didn't need to fail."  
> &hellip;  
> "I'm just astounded by the dysfunction, the willingness to just stay the course as hundreds of thousands of people die, and the unwillingness to innovate in literally any way," said Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has been advocating for widespread at-home rapid antigen testing since March, with little success. "I've realized that when we need to rise up as a country, we have truly no moral capacity to do it. It's just the most mind-bending, complete "Twilight Zone" experience that makes you ask why the hell we even bother."  

We have many scientists and clinicians who have spent their entire careers preparing for
situations like this.  Instead of listening to them, we prefer dirt-stupid claims of
right-wing politics, general cowardice of our leaders, and downright superstition.  People
don't just ignore public health guidance, they're _hostile_ to it:  
> [Harvard epidemiologist Dr. Caroline Buckee] suspended her Twitter account after her feed, mostly consisting of pandemic advice and research, triggered a cascade of sexist and personal attacks that threatened her and her family.  
> &hellip;  
> &hellip; in late November, [Dr. Ashish Jha, deah of Brown University's School of Public Health] testified before Congress about the inefficacy of hydroxychloroquine, a drug used to treat malaria and touted by President Trump as a “game changer” in the fight against the coronavirus. Shortly after the hearing, Jha said the threats lodged at him grew more serious and tangible, prompting him to alert police, who sent cruisers to patrol his neighborhood.  
>  
> The experience mirrors that of Dr. Anthony Fauci, perhaps the nation’s most well-known infectious disease expert, who has required a security detail for months following threats to himself and his family.  


## What you can do  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-28-youre-scaring-me-1918-flu-pandemic-poster.jpg" width="400" height="506" alt="1918 flu pandemic poster urging masks" title="1918 flu pandemic poster urging masks" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
A century ago, our elders knew how to do The Right Thing during the 1918 flu pandemic.  Why don't we?  

Look, I'm gonna 
[repeat &amp; amplify some stuff I said here last month]({{ site.baseurl }}/coronavirus-winter-of-our-discontent/#what-you-can-do),
things you can do to make life a little bit better:  
- __Wear a mask!__  It won't suffocate you.  It might save your life, or the lives of
  people around you.  Wear it _properly_, over both your mouth &amp; nose.  Don't be dumb, here.  
- __Maintain social distance.__  Stay 2 meters (6 feet) from others, even with
  masks.  Stay _completely_ away from people who don't wear masks, since they're
  advertising their recklessness.  
- __Stay home or work remotely, if you can.__  Not everybody can do this.  But if you can,
  you should.  Think of it as your civic duty.  
- __No gatherings other than with the people of your immediate household, especially indoors.__
  Indoor dining at restaurants is a _spectacularly terrible_ idea.  (Though takeout is a great
  way to support local businesses, if you can afford it.)  
- __Lay in some extra food &amp; prescription medications if you need them.__  In case of
  another lockdown or &mdash; Heaven forbid &mdash; _more_ civil unrest, you'll be glad you don't
  have to go out.  A bit of home preparedness now will let you relax a bit in the coming
  months.  Think of it as your duty to your family &amp; loved ones.  
- __Get a flu shot!__  At this point, I have exactly _zero_ patience left to listen to anybody
  whine about their "skepticism" of vaccines.  You don't want to present at your local
  ER this winter as yet another febrile patient with headache, aches &amp; pains, and a
  cough.  You really don't: you'll be using up resources that real COVID-19 patients
  need, _just to stay alive_.  So get a flu shot, and get out of their way.  It's covered
  by all reasonable insurance and Medicare.  Even if not covered, it's like \$20 at your
  local drugstore.  You got this.  Just do it.  
- __Don't be a super-spreader of misinformation.__  Fox and Facebook are _terrible_
  sources of information.  
- __Vote, dammit!__ (If you are eligible to vote in the Georgia Senate run-off,
  2021-Jan-05.) Look, it really matters that you vote.  You already know my opinion, but
  really: you can't possibly be _undecided_, can you?  Even if you're a lifelong
  Republican just now awakening to the damage accrued since Reagan&hellip; well, get over
  it and vote that sort of thing out of office at every level.  As someone who grew up
  Republican, I promise you: it doesn't hurt.  A Republican vote is a vote for continued
  dysfunction; vote for Ossof &amp; Warnock instead.  Maybe kick a couple bucks their way,
  as we've done here at Chez Weekend.  They're good guys.
  [Stacey Abrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Abrams) says so, and she seems to
  know what she's doing.  
- __Get vaccinated:__ When your turn comes, get whatever COVID-19 vaccine is on offer.
  It'll be covered by your insurance.  Even if you are uninsured (really?  still?!), it will be
  cheap &ndash; much cheaper than dying.  So take the vaccine, _thank_ the clinician who
  gives it to you, and _smile_.  Be sure to go back for the second dose, because _that's
  important_.  

Listen to [Gandalf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf), as
[Helen Branswell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Branswell) helpfully advises below.
(Or [Magneto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto_(Marvel_Comics)), if that's how you roll.)
Either way: get vaccinated, and stay safe until then.
