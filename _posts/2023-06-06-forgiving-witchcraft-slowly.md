Does anybody else wonder what's going on in the heads of legislators who are "outlier"
votes?  Like, when a vote is 33-1, what's that one guy thinking?  Principled holdout, or
just stubborn?  (Or maybe not very bright?)  

## Connecticut and Witchcraft  

Here in New England, we're famous for many things.  

One of those things that's campy on the surface, but actually regrettable upon reflection,
is the series of witch trials in the mid 1600s to maybe 1700.  They're entertainingly
weird, when viewed from a safe distance of nearly 4 centuries.  But when you think about
the authoritarian moral panic and the literal torture and state-sanctioned murder it
inflicted on women (and a few men), it's just sad and shameful.  (Cue
[Arthur Miller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller), who wrote
[_The Crucible_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crucible) during the "political witch trials"
in America of the McCarthy era, when Republicans saw communist conspiracies everywhere.)  

You'd think we'd learn, but today's moral panic over trans people is disappointingly
similar.

So it's&hellip; _interesting_ (in some ways)&hellip; to see the Connecticut legislature has
pardoned, or at least apologized for, the persecutions and killings of that time.  It's
apparently important enough to make both _CNN_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> and 
the _BBC_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> take notice, as well as a press release from
the CT state senator claiming to have led that effort <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>.  

It is admirably brief (7 lines) and to the point, as legislation goes.  No reasonably literate
person can claim not to understand the point (witchcraft trials = wrong) and the
modern-day effect of the apology/pardon (not much).  The legislation/resolution reads, in its
entirety <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>:  

> Resolved by this Assembly:  
>  
> 1 That the General Assembly recognizes that residents of colonial  
> 2 Connecticut were falsely accused of practicing witchcraft in the  
> 3 seventeenth century and that such persons were tried, convicted and  
> 4 sometimes sentenced to death for such offense, and declares that,  
> 5 although these accusations, prosecutions, trials and executions cannot  
> 6 be undone or changed, no disgrace or cause for distress should attach to  
> 7 the heirs of those persons.  

_CNN_ mentions the feelings of relief &ndash; and some cautions &ndash; about alienating
people, as reported by a _14th generation lineal descendant_ of one of the victims.  14 generations
is a long time; systemic violence does lasting damage!  


## But&hellip; I Have Some Questions  

That's&hellip; ok, I guess?  I mean, I don't see how any reasonable person can object to
this.  It may not be the _best_ use of legislative time, but it's certainly not a _bad_
use of time to admit mistakes, even old ones.  And it's not like this takes a _lot_ of
legislative time for debate, or so one would think.  

But&hellip; I Have Some Questions.  (_Comme d'habitude._)  

1. I realize that "What took you so long?!" is kind of a snarky question.  But, c'mon,
   really: 14 generations and nearly 4 centuries means A Really Long Time.  
   
   I understand why the legislatures of the late 1600s or so didn't want to correct the
   mistakes, because they were the ones who made the mistakes.  Nobody _likes_ that.  

   But surely, after maybe 2 generations, their grandchildren would be willing to distance
   the government &ndash; and themselves &ndash; from the errors of their elders?  

   Surely nobody from the late 1600s would be still in office in the mid 1700s.  After
   all, the word ["senator" comes from the Latin _senex, senatoris_ meaning "old man"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Roman_Kingdom#:~:text=The%20word%20senate%20derives%20from,as%20%22Council%20of%20Elders%22.),
   so the originals would have died off. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  

2. This isn't the first time they tried this.  Not even the first time in the 21st
   century!  

   <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-06-forgiving-witchcraft-slowly-ct-res-26-2008.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-06-forgiving-witchcraft-slowly-ct-res-26-2008-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="264" alt="CT Jt Res 26, 2008: Illustration of hanged witches" title="CT Jt Res 26, 2008: Illustration of hanged witches" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   In 2008, Joint Resolution 26 was proposed <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, illustrated
   as shown here with the great charm one expects of legislators, to accomplish more or
   less the same thing.  

   But it apparently didn't pass, for reasons unknown.  Did someone actually _object_ to
   this?!  

3. Actually, this isn't even the _second_ time in this century.  After 2008, _CNN_ reported
   attempts to get the CT governor to sign a proclamation of exoneration and get the Board
   of Pardons and Parole to issue posthumous pardons.  
   
   This also failed.  How did that happen?  Did the relevant people just not pay
   attention, or did they actually _want_ to perpetuate witchcraft convictions from 4
   centuries ago?  
    
4. And even this, the _third_ attempt just in the new 21st century, was not unanimous!  

   - The earlier House vote on this was 121-30.  Why did about 20% of the House actively
     vote against this?  Are they the sort of superstitious dolt one finds among
     fundamentalists, who think witchcraft is actually a thing, and should be punished?
     Are they incapable of admitting a nearly 4 century old error?  
   - And in the Senate, the vote was 33-1-2.  
     - Who were the 2 abstentions, and why?  

       If they were just absent because this was not a terribly important vote, then I get
       it.  But if they actually, formally abstained and refused to commit either way on
       this issue&hellip; _what were they thinking?_  

     - Who's the lone holdout who actively voted "no"?  
     
       What were _they_ thinking, or is it a
       [category error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake)
       to use the verb "thinking" for this process?  

       The _BBC_ article says this was CT Senator Rob Sampson, who:  
       
       > &hellip; said that he believed it was wrong to "dictate what was right or wrong
       > about periods in the past that we have no knowledge of".  
       >  
       > "I don't want to see bills that rightfully or wrongfully attempt to paint America
       > as a bad place with a bad history," he was quoted as saying by the Associated
       > Press.  
       >  
       > "I want us to focus on where we're going, which is a brighter and better future."  

       Or, in other words, he's worried about _image_, and can't be bothered to think about
       the reality of the wrong done to the victims.  The "rightfully or wrongfully" part
       says he's not even especially inconvenienced by concepts like _truth._ 

       Perhaps his constituents will take note of this: if he thinks thus about small
       issues, how flexible about truth will he be on big issues, where there are actual
       consequences and lobbyists vying for his vote?  

It's a simple thing, but there are always so _many_ questions&hellip;  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

May we all be more quick to forgive, and more nimble at recognizing mistakes.  

We can apply that rule to ourselves individually, as well: recognize our own mistakes and
forgive ourselves.

And yes, I say this from the perspective being personally an Old White Man.  Yes, I think
I'm reasonably smart; but no, there is no particular reason for you to agree unless I
demonstrate it to your satisfaction.  

Also, they're not especially representative: due to over-representation from sparsely
populated rural states, about 50% of the Senate represents only about 20% of the voters.
This helps explain why the Senate is so _maddeningly_ conservative.  

Though not, perhaps, so maddeningly conservative as to preserve witchcraft convictions for
nearly 4 centuries.  Because, after all, the US Senate is only 234 years old as of today!
