A major solar coronal mass ejection has resulted in generational-sized geomagnetic storms
on Earth.  Also, [glow-thingies](https://nightvale.fandom.com/wiki/Glow_Cloud_(All_Hail)) in the sky.  


## Sun: Big Zit  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-13-aurorae-borealium-sunspot.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-13-aurorae-borealium-sunspot-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, Lockheed-Martin Solar &amp; Astrophysics Laboratory: Sol on 2024-May-09" title="Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, Lockheed-Martin Solar &amp; Astrophysics Laboratory: Sol on 2024-May-09" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The Sun has weather, in the form of magnetic storms, sunspots, and giant Coronal Mass
Ejections in which it spews huge amounts of solar plasma off into space.  That's what's
happened this last week.  Here you can see an image of the Sun (not in visible light,
obviously) on 2024-May-09.  The giant bright spot in the lower right is a giant sunspot,
about $O(10^5)$ km across &ndash; about 15x the diameter of Earth.  That's our new friend,
sunspot AR13664.  

You can look at the relevant images yourself, playing around with the time and the
wavelength window at
[the Lockheed-Martin Solar Astrophysics Laboratory site](https://cruiser.lmsal.com/?catalogName=SDO+Recent&subCatalogName=quarter_res&cadence=5h&startTime=2024-04-29T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&endTime=2024-05-14T00%3A00%3A00.000Z&channel=171%3AAIA&channel=BLOS%3AHMI&channel=1700%3AAIA).
You'll have to go ahead and fool around with the controls yourself to get to 2024-May-09
in the afternoon.)  

The resulting solar storms are divided into classes called B, C, M, and X.  Each class has
10x the energy of the previous.  This one is class X4, i.e., _honkin' huge._  This is the
sort of thing one sees once in a generation, or longer.  

That results in a geomagnetic storm on Earth: huge electric fields sustained in the
magnetosphere, and even down to the surface.  Big enough and it'll take out long-haul
power lines, which just look like big receiving antennas getting fried by the power thrown
at them.  Big enough and they take out satellites.
[This one is class G4 according to NOAA and the Space Weather Prediction Center](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/news/g4-watch-effect-may-11);
if it had gotten to G5 for very long it would have taken out satellites.  Again, once in a
generation.

The venerable _Globe_ has an explainer <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> that's worth your
time.  They'll point you at NOAA, the Space Weather sites, explain sunspots, coronal mass
ejections, and geomagnetic storms.  

They spend most of their time explaining what the impact on Earth will be _(q.v.)_,
from our somewhat parochially human viewpoint.  It's hard to convey how _extreme_ events
like this are, and how much solar astronomers want to get their instruments set _just
right_ to record it.  The Sun is ejecting flares of X-rays and some huge streams of
sun-stuff in spiral waves that will soon reach Earth and tell us all kinds of things about
solar physics.  

Oh, and if we're lucky it'll _only_ take down our comsats and electrical power distribution
grid.  (Back in the 60s, people used to worry about accidental nuclear launches.
Fortunately, all that stuff is (a) smaller now, and (b) hardened appropriately.)  


## Aurora Borealis  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-13-aurorae-borealium-xkcd.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-13-aurorae-borealium-xkcd-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="463" alt="XKCD Knows All" title="XKCD Knows All" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
As per the customs of our tribe, [XKCD has the correct interpretation](https://xkcd.com/2233/), shown here.
Seeing aurora borealis (Latin: "dawn of the north", plural "aurorae borealium", southern
hemisphere version "aurora australis") at high latitudes is entirely ordinary.  Seeing it
at lower latitudes is at first rare, then exciting, then&hellip; well, check for damage to
satellites and power lines.  I think at this point we're in the "exciting" range, as no
damage seems to have been reported after the fact.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-13-aurorae-borealium-globe-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-13-aurorae-borealium-globe-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="426" alt="NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center: Aurora prediction, 2024-May-09" title="NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center: Aurora prediction, 2024-May-09" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Usefully, the venerable _Globe_ also reported this map, showing where to expect aurorae.
As you can see, it's normally a polar affair.  (Extra points: explain why it's not seen
_exactly_ at the magnetic pole, but only in a band around it.  Hint: Think of the
_direction_ of the magnetic field and the direction of the incoming plasma.  What's the
cross product?)  

The big red band covering substantially all of Canada (hi, Canadians!) is the prime
viewing area.  So we're not in that band, but here in New England we're at least on the
outer fringes of visibility (see the thin red line just south of Massachusetts).  

I got really excited about this!  The Weekend Editrix had just had a COVID-19 booster, and
so was more interested in sleep.  I got out to look up at the sky&hellip; well, see
below.  

The physics of an aurora is quite complex.  I'm not terribly surprised; it seemed to me
way back in grad school that _everything_ that touches astrophysics is a complex _gemisch_
of everything possible.  In astro, you can only take observations, not conduct highly
controlled experiments.  So none of the "clean" interpretations you can get in the lab.  

Still, Kyle Cranmer provided a nice little explainer on social media of what's going on.
Basically, air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen.  Depending on which molecule you're
hammering on, and at what pressure, you get various colors:

## Les Pics!  

Ok, enough nattering on about physics.  What did it _look_ like?  

Alas, it was cloudy both nights here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend.  Also, considerable urban
light pollution; we might be in suburbia but not in the "ultra-boonies", as they were
called during my mis-spent childhood.  

However, other people had better luck.  Here's a dramatic photo, via
[mathstodon.xyz](https://mathstodon.xyz) (my favored social media hangout with fellow math
nerds), from Joseph Andriano taken 2024-May-10 @ 10:40pm near the Vermont state house:

Here are some rather more local pictures, taken by a friend &amp; his son (reproduced with
permission).  

Having been warned this was happening by your humble Weekend Editor, they first drove out
to Acton, MA ("deepest, darkest, exurbia", about 20 mi NW of Boston)
and found a high school athletic field where the lights had been turned off.  

At the bottom, you can see some of the building lights were still on.  The aurora here is
low on the horizon, because most of the activity is much further north &ndash; so you have
to look at the atmosphere further north, not so much the atmosphere above you.  It's
primarily green, so we're seeing mostly the action on monatomic oxygen at
mid-altitude/higher pressures (up to ~ 240km).  I wasn't there, so I can't say what it
looked like in real time, but it probably wiggled a bit like the bottom of a giant
curtain.  _Cognoscenti_ may possibly be able to identify Polaris here.  

Note that this is not _exactly_ what one sees with the naked eye.  The night vision on a
good cell phone camera has much better than human capability!  At first they thought there
was nothing much happening, but their cameras told another story.  

Upon returning home to deepest, not-so-darkest suburbia just west of Boston, they wondered
if anything would be visible here.  To the naked eye, there was nothing.  But a phone
camera from a north-facing bedroom window, looking at the horizon, found the second
picture shown here (a little blurry from a hand-held longer exposure).  Clearly there's a
faint green curtain of light &ndash; mid-altitude oxygen again &ndash; just peeking
through the city lights.  

They apparently took this much later than when I looked, since all the clouds had
cleared.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Nature is beautiful.  

The more physics you know, the more deeply you can appreciate that beauty.  

We, as humans, should also attempt to behave in morally beautiful ways so as to deserve
the world's beauty.

## Addendum 2024-May-14: Portland Head Light in Maine  

Here's a beautiful photo tweeted by photographer Benjamin Williamson (@photographmaine),
taken at Cape Elizabeth Maine, at the Portland Head Light:

Being a little bit further north helps a little.  

Being a professional photographer helps a lot!
