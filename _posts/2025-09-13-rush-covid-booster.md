Today I got the fall 2025-2026 COVID-19 booster.  Why so early?  


## You Have to Get Out Ahead of the Crazy  

Normally, I'd say get both the flu and COVID-19 shots sometime early in October, so
immunity would peak in the middle of winter.  Right now, mid-September, is a bit early.  Why
the rush?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-13-rush-covid-booster-wapo-1.jpg" width="400" height="515" alt="Sun, et al. @ WaPo: Trump officials using bogus COVID vax links to child deaths" title="Sun, et al. @ WaPo: Trump officials using bogus COVID vax links to child deaths" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-13-rush-covid-booster-ars-1.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="Mole @ Ars Technica: Kennedy's CDC may limit COVID-19 vax to 75+" title="Mole @ Ars Technica: Kennedy's CDC may limit COVID-19 vax to 75+" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Because Kennedy and his new ACIP crew, packed with unqualified people, are forming up to
withdraw the vaccinations _completely._  The _WaPo_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> and
_Ars Technica_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> report:  

> Trump health officials plan to link coronavirus vaccines to the deaths of 25 children as
> they consider limiting which Americans should get the shots, according to four people
> familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe
> confidential information.  

They apparently plan to do this at the 2025-Sep-18 meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices.  Kennedy recently fired the ACIP members, replacing them with
unqualified people more to his liking.  They will have in their power to revoke
recommendations and insurance coverage for the vaccines, as well as ask the FDA to ban the
medications altogether.  

The data they're using is from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS, though
really the "R" should stand for "Rumors").  The thing to know about VAERS: _nothing in it
is verified!_ Literally _anybody_ can enter their story and claim it's vaccine-related.
(Why does that even exist?  Sort of an early warning system, to tell you to _go look at
other data_ to see if it's real, and no more than that.)

So&hellip; vibes, basically.  

This is&hellip; _alarming._  

And it's not just alarming to me, but also to epidemiologists and physicians.  Witness the
reaction to epidemiologist Elizabeth Jacobs from a physician and clinical virologist:  

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nichrome77.bsky.social/post/3lyojuncz7c2e"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-13-rush-covid-booster-jacobs-1.jpg" width="550" height="562" alt="Jacobs: get COVID-19 vax BEFORE the meeting on Sep 18" title="Jacobs: get COVID-19 vax BEFORE the meeting on Sep 18" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

Ok, that's enough for me to act!  I scheduled an appointment this very day.  (The Weekend
Editrix is, alas, in Japan now.  When we video this evening, I'll beg her to get a booster
in Japan.)  


## What's mNEXSPIKE?  

Upon scheduling the appointment, I was informed that since I was over 65, I'd be getting
the Moderna "mNEXSPIKE" vaccine. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  Apparently this is a
new and different thing for elders and those at higher risk for severe COVID-19, so let's
find out what it is.  

We've known for some time now that the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are not just
straight-up RNA sequences from the virus, but are particularly engineered to replicate
fast and stimulate deep immune reactions.  We've even analyzed, on this Crummy Little Blog
That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), those sequences to find about 11 different biohacks that were
applied to the sequences. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-13-rush-covid-booster-vaxad-1.jpg" width="400" height="150" alt="Ernst @ Vaccine Advisor: FDA approves mNEXSPIKE" title="Ernst @ Vaccine Advisor: FDA approves mNEXSPIKE" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-13-rush-covid-booster-medlett-1.jpg" width="400" height="167" alt="Medical Letter: mNEXSPIKE &ndash; a new Moderna COVID-19 vaccine" title="Medical Letter: mNEXSPIKE &ndash; a new Moderna COVID-19 vaccine" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So it should come as no surprise that this has continued.  <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>
<sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  
- __Recommendation:__ It's recommended for those over 65 or age 12-64 with at least one underlying condition
  that means COVID-19 would be especially bad news.  It apparently induces _even stronger_
  immunity than the Moderna SPIKEVAX, _q.v._, so it's appropriate for elders whose immune
  systems need stronger provocation.  
- __Design:__ Rather than reproduce (an engineered form of) the whole spike protein, it
  _just_ contains 2 domains of the protein: the N-terminus domain and the receptor binding
  domain.  
  - Proteins are made up of a chain of amino acids, and the way they fit together means
    you've got a nitrogen hanging off one end (N) and a carbon off the other (C).  For the
    SARS-CoV2 spike, the N-terminus domain is involved in sticking to the target cell for
    infection.  
  - The receptor binding domain is what binds to a receptor (ACE2, I think?) on the cell
    surface to get itself inside the cell.  
  - Obviously those 2 areas of the protein are crucial for infection, and they're where
    most antibodies tend to bind anyway.  So mNEXSPIKE concentrates on just those areas.  
- __Dose:__ One of the reasons I've liked Moderna is that it's dosed higher than Pfizer.
  Here with mNEXSPIKE, though, the dose goes down (50&mu;g for SPIKEVAX vs 10&mu;g for
  mNEXSPIKE).  That's because it induces such a stronger immune reaction, you just need
  less of it.  
- __Clinical trials:__ The Phase 3 NextCOVE study
  ([NCT05815498](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05815498), 11,454 persons) compared
  mNEXSPIKE with SPIKEVAX, head-to-head.  

  The goal was to demonstrate "noninferiority", i.e., get at least as good efficacy, and
  in fact get the lower 95% confidence limit of the efficacy difference between mNEXSPIKE
  and SPIKEVAX to be above -10%.  That is, you want to see more efficacy from mNEXSPIKE,
  and you want to be _very sure that the worst case_ is not too bad.  
  - That goal was met: mNEXSPIKE has 9.3% (99.4% CI, -6.6, 22.8) higher relative vaccine
    efficacy relative to SPIKEVAX.  
  - Specifically in seniors, it was even better: 13.5% [95% CI, -7.7, 30.6].  
  - It also induced higher seroresponse rates and geometric mean neutralizing antibody
    titers.  

So&hellip; yeah, this looks really, really good.  


## The Vax Experience  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-13-rush-covid-booster-mNEXSPIKE.jpg" width="400" height="377" alt="Moderna: mNEXSPIKE" title="Moderna: mNEXSPIKE" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-13-rush-covid-booster-arm.jpg" width="400" height="314" alt="Your humble Weekend Editor's left dorsal manipulator tentacle, getting jabbed" title="Your humble Weekend Editor's left dorsal manipulator tentacle, getting jabbed" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So here we are, at our local pharmacy, at the appointed hour for a same-day appointment.
(And for that, I'm grateful.)  

As you can see, they did indeed trot out the mNEXSPIKE version of the Moderna vaccine for
your humble Weekend Editor.  It amazes me that we've gotten _so good_ at engineering mRNA
sequences for immune stimulation that you only need to give me 10&mu;g IM to drive my
aging immune system into staying on guard for the next 6 months.  

And, as is now a CLBTNR tradition, here is my portside dorsal manipulator tentacle,
dutifully and gratefully receiving the jab.  By my count, that is my 11th COVID-19 shot,
since starting way back in March of 2021.  

Mission thus having been accomplished, I picked up a gyro/veggie/rice plate from a deli on the
way home.  Probably not gonna feel like cooking dinner tonight, and that's fine.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The Weekend Editrix is currently in Japan.  I'll have to ask her to ask around about the
availability of the 2025-2026 COVID-19 booster there before she returns to the US.  

Get yourself covered _now_, while it's still possible.  

As always, with COVID-19 vaccination blog posts, tune in tomorrow to hear about the
(generally minor) side effects.

## Addendum 2025-Sep-14: Sequelae  

So here we are, 24 hours later.  

The vaccine mNEXSPIKE is advertised as provoking a stronger immune reaction (so it's given
at a lower dose).  And yes&hellip; yes, it _does_ indeed do that.  I had a somewhat
difficult night, with about 1.5&deg;C fever, extreme fatigue, and a headache that strobed
every time I coughed.  But, honestly, it was not as bad as getting a mild case of the
flu.  

And by this afternoon it's not _entirely_ cleared up, but well enough.  And I can take
some ibuprofen.  It'll be fine.  

Absolutely worth it.  I so _very_ much look forward to not getting COVID-19 this winter.  

You should, too.  

## Addendum 2025-Sep-20: ACIP Results  

So, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice finally met.  

It was, in the words of one epidemiologist, a "goat rodeo":  
- They tried to rebunk the thoroughly debunked ["turbo cancer" anti-vax conspiracy theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_cancer) that mRNA vaccines somehow cause cancer.  
- They tried to promote the exceptionally stupid proposition that COVID-19 vaccines cause
  "&hellip; changes in the immune system that cause other infections, autoimmunity, chronic
  inflammation, immune tolerance and impaired immune surveillance including immune fatigue
  or suppression."  
- They tried to say it caused multiple child deaths, using unverified VAERS reports that
  did not check out anywhere else.  
- They subjected CDC scientists to the verbal equivalent of waterboarding, with questions
  that were wildly inappropriate, irrelevant, and disrespectful.  (Like: "If a
  hippopotamus appeared in your lab&hellip;")
- They tried to blame Long COVID on vaccines, despite evidence saying the exact opposite
  (not to mention that most cases of Long COVID date from _before_ the vaccines were available).  
- They tried to impose a requirement for a prescription (just barely failed, on a 6-6 tie vote).  
- When that failed, they imposed a requirement for "shared clinical decision making" with
  a healthcare provider.  
  - An interesting loophole: [a pharmacist counts](https://www.cdc.gov/acip/vaccine-recommendations/shared-clinical-decision-making.html#:~:text=In%20this%20context%2C%20CDC%20defines%20a%20health%20care%20provider%20as%20anyone%20who%20provides%20or%20administers%20vaccines%3A%20primary%20care%20physicians%2C%20specialists%2C%20physician%20assistants%2C%20nurse%20practitioners%2C%20registered%20nurses%2C%20and%20pharmacists.), so if you ask a pharmacist for a vaccination, the requirement is met!
  - Interestingly, given the requirement for younger people to have a medical need, the
    [Michigan Chief Medical Executive declared](https://www.michigan.gov/mdhhs/inside-mdhhs/newsroom/2025/09/19/standing-rec) 
    that not having the latest vaccination was _itself_ a condition that constituted
    sufficient medical need to justify getting the latest vaccination.  It's come down to
    that, apparently.  

In general, they entertained arrant nonsense, disinformation and outright lies, while
showing little to no understanding of the principles of public health.  

Still&hellip; they did _not_ pull the authorization, so the vaccines are still available.
While the "consultation with a health care practitioner" will almost surely be abused in
red states to throw up barriers, at least the rest of us should not have too much problem
getting vaccinated.  

Still, I'm glad I got it done _before_ the "goat rodeo".  And I'm glad the Weekend Editrix
will be able to get it upon her return from Japan.
