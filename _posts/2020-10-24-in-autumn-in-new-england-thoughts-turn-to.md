At autumn in New England, thoughts turn to the extreme beauty of nature, the weather
turning more comfortably cooler &amp; drier, cinnamon and nutmeg smells everywhere,
and... trebuchets, catapaults, air cannons, and other implements of imparting to pumpkins
various levels of sub-orbital trajectories.  

It's autumn... _finally_.  2020, in a single year, has managed to impose several decades
of wear and tear on all of us.  But autumn _in New England_... well, even the most dark, dour
and depressed heart such as that of your humble Weekend Editor cannot help but breathe in
the beautiful scents and bask with relief in the beauty.  

## Autumnal stress-relief trip

This week, your Weekend Editor & Editrix went on a little trip to look at foliage in the 
[Berkshires](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshires).  (Don't
judge us; it's a New England thing.)  We stayed at the (empty) house of some friends,
cooked for ourselves, work masks outside, and maintained extreme social distance.  But
was, quite literally, our first time away from home in the last 7 months due to the
COVID-19 pandemic.  So it was _special_.

The views from the hairpin turn near the Whitcomb Summit on the 
[Mohawk Trail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohawk_Trail) in the 
Hoosac Range, and from the peak of
[Mt Greylock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Greylock) were spectacular!  (The 
[Bridge of Flowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_of_Flowers_(bridge)) is also
quite spectacular in a different way, though perhaps this was not the correct time of the year.)  

At lower altitudes, Pontoosuc Lake and the view of the mountains from 
[The Clark](https://www.clarkart.edu/).  (The photo doesn't _quite_ capture how beautiful the
leaves falling at The Clark were; every gust of wind brought a huge hail of leaves down.
Your Weekend Editor is a crappy photographer.  Hint: the mouse-over hovertext for each
picture gives you the caption; each picture is a link to a larger version.)  

Even something as simple as a backyard tree at the house of our friends, illuminated by a
sunset, was something to make one pause.  

So... yeah, that was pretty good.  

## The _other_ thing about autumn: pumpkins!

The other thing about autumn is what people get up to with pumpkins.  I mean, it's just
some innocent gourd, right?  But they decorate with them, even to the extent of
[using glass labs at a major research university to craft blown-glass replicas](https://news.mit.edu/2020/its-virtual-great-glass-pumpkin-patch-mit-1021), 
a favorite of the Weekend Editrix.  And they carve them &mdash; good heavens, they carve them in
oddball ways!  They even 
[pumpkinize the face of Dr. Horrible](https://www.flickr.com/photos/steveoftheweb/4062468120/) 
from [Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog](https://drhorrible.com/).

But all that... _cute_ as it is... is as _nothing_ compared to what happens when mathematicians,
scientists, and engineers put their minds to The Problem of the Pumpkin.  For example, at
MIT <sup id="fn1a">[[1](#fn1)]</sup> there is a tradition of dropping pumpkins from high
buildings, to "investigate" the splatter patterns.  I once observed pumpkins filled with
liquid nitrogen, frozen solid, converting 22 stories of gravitational potential energy to
kinetic, then interacting with the concrete &amp; asphalt below in a manner generally
agreed to be _most satisfactory_.  I seem to remember they flashed as they hit, 
too. <sup id="fn2a">[[2](#fn2)]</sup>

Nonetheless... cute as _that_ is... it has recently come to my attention that there is a
higher form of pumpkin madness: the annual (since 1986)
[World Championship Punkin Chunkin](https://www.punkinchunkin.com/).  They use 
[trebuchets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet),
[catapaults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catapult), and (my favorite) compressed air
cannons apparently with [multi-stage pressure injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-3_cannon)!
(I wonder if the barrels have rifling to impart spin stabilization to the pumpkin?  Or
would the irregularity of the pumpkin surface cause enough unpredictable turbulence to
make that kind of pointless?  So many questions!)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-10-24-in-autumn-in-new-england-thoughts-turn-to-pumpkin-air-cannon.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="Pumpkin air cannon" title="Pumpkin air cannon" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
The record is a 2013 throw of a full-sized pumpkin for 4694.68ft.  (I love that they
hallucinate a precision of 6 significant figures.)  Throwing a pumpkin
for just a bit short of a mile is... well, artillery.  It should come as no surprise that
it's being held at a small airport.  They may need redirection of air traffic: if
you're going a mile downrange, you're probably going _up_ about half that &mdash; a flying
pumpkin at 2300 feet altitude is surely a hazard to air navigation.  

Their [rule book](https://www.punkinchunkin.com/the-competition/rules/) makes for for
interesting reading, too.  They've been at this for rather a long time (since 1986), and
have extensive (and laudable) safety rules.  

- Some safety rules are pretty obvious, like a strict no alcohol policy and that minors must be always supervised.  
- Still other rules make me scratch my head: "All pumpkins fired must remain intact until they impact the ground to obtain an official measurement."  Now, _how can they tell_ if a pumpkin disintegrates in flight?  A quick back of the envelope calculation <sup id="fn3a">[[3](#fn3)]</sup> says, neglecting air resistance, to travel 4000 feet downrange launched at the optimal 45&deg;, the muzzle velocity must be 244 mph  &mdash; at which speed it's difficult to decide if the pumpkin has cracked up "enough" to violate the rules.  
- Some other rules are... less obvious.  I mean: if your hobby requires a Range Safety Officer, a no firearms policy, required ultrasound testing of pressure vessels, and an explicit ban on _explosives_... it may be time to rethink your life choices.  The events that led to those rules sound like things I'd want to skip.  

Still, I bet it's a blast. (Ahem.)  

There may be madness to their methods; but their madness is the 
[divine madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_madness).

## Notes

<a id="fn1">1</a>: And apparently 
[also at CalTech](https://www.latimes.com/socal/burbank-leader/the818now/pasadenasu-1101-halloween-pumpkins-meet-their-explosive-end-at-caltech-story.html)?
Possibly elsewhere.  

It's become a bit of a Nerd Tribe custom.  If you shiver with excitement, wish you were
there, and want to participate, you may be a potential member of the Tribe.  If, on the
other hand, you think something like "Why in the world would you...", then you are not a
member of the Tribe.  So long as you are even slightly respectful of our customs, you may
consider yourself granted Honored Guest status within the Nerd Tribe. [↩](#fn1a)  

<a id="fn2">2</a>: Maybe a [triboluminescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboluminescence)
thing going on there, like 
[the wintergreen Life-Savers trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triboluminescence#Examples)? 
[↩](#fn2a)  

<a id="fn3">3</a>: Let $v_0$ be the muzzle velocity, $R$ be the range, $\theta$ be the
angle of inclination of the barrel at firing, and $g$ be the downard acceleration due to
gravity.  We'll totally (and unrealistically) neglect air friction.  

Then the initial vertical velocity is $v_0 \sin \theta$.  The vertical distance $y$
travelled as a function of time, by elementary kinematics, is: 
$y(t) = v_0 \sin \theta\, t - g t^2 / 2$.  The pumpkin is at ground height when $y = 0$.
Setting $y(t) = 0$ gives 2 solutions: $t = 0$ (at launch) and $t = 2 v_0 \sin \theta / g$
(at impact).  

So the latter solution tells us how long the pumpkin is in the air.  Then the range
travelled is the horizontal velocity $v_0 \cos \theta$ times the time in the air, or 
$R = v_{0}^{2} \sin 2\theta / g$.  (As a check, differentiation with respect to $\theta$
recovers the expected result that range is maximized by firing at $\theta = \pi/4$, or
45&deg;.)  

Solve for the muzzle velocity to get $v_0 = \sqrt{R g / \sin 2\theta}$.
But $\sin 2\theta = 1$ at 45&deg;.  For a range $R = 4000$ ft and earth gravity 
$g = 32 \textrm{ft}/\textrm{sec}^2$, we get a muzzle velocity of 
$v_0 = 357.7 \textrm{ft/sec} = 244 \textrm{mi/hr}$. [↩](#fn3a)
