Sometimes, the "right to repair" can be taken to levels best described as pure madness.  


## Right-to-Repair Laws  

One of the minor controversies of late-stage capitalism is called the
["right to repair"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair).  

Why is it a controversy?  Corporations would like to chip away as much as they can at your
ownership rights.  You don't own your software, you have a license.  You can't let just
anybody fix your car, you have to take it to a dealer.  Your car can have all sorts of
spyware so it's a security dumpster fire on wheels, but you have no right to turn any of
it off.  And so on: this way, they can enforce monopoly pricing on repairs and continue to
gouge you.  

Some states, such as the 
[Weekend State](https://www.autocare.org/government-relations/current-issues/right-to-repair)
wherein Ch&acirc;teau Weekend is located, have passed laws about this.  Automakers must
sell computers to repair shops to read out maintenance codes.  They have to publish the
meaning of those maintenance codes, and so on.  

Your humble Weekend Editor is strongly in favor of this, especially since it is a (minor)
push-back against the corporate power of late-stage capitalism.  


## Today's R-to-R Champion(s)  

But&hellip; sometimes people take things to extremes.  Actually, almost always.  There's
always one in every crowd.  

It's not that I disapprove of what you're about to see.  I'm just taken aback by the sheer
_madness_ of the entire thing.  Sure, he has a right to repair his stuff&hellip; it's just
that he's gone way further than any sane person would go.  

To wit: one hkz@chinwag.org, on the Mastodon federated social network.  He's so anxious to
repair&hellip; well, _something_&hellip; that he's soldering connections back in place
_inside the packaging of an integrated circuit:_  
<a href="https://social.chinwag.org/@hkz/112424403781587922"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-14-rtr-madness-ex-1.jpg" width="550" height="1098" alt="HKZ @ Mastodon: Soldering INSIDE a chip" title="HKZ @ Mastodon: Soldering INSIDE a chip" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Now _that,_ my brothers and sisters, is _devotion._  It is not sanity, but it is
devotion.  

This much I can understand.  After all: there's always one in every crowd, no?  

But what if there's more than one?  Could there be _other_ people, with brains equally
scrambled?  Surely not, I thought.  But then I had the rashness to look, and was
disabused of that notion by a second examples in the replies to the above:  
<a href="https://social.chinwag.org/@emanuel@schleuss.online/112427286948158072"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-14-rtr-madness-ex-2.jpg" width="550" height="898" alt="Schleussinger @ Mastodon: ALSO soldering INSIDE a chip" title="Schleussinger @ Mastodon: ALSO soldering INSIDE a chip" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

After a bit of hunting, I discovered what is apparently a whole subculture of people who
are taking their desire to repair to levels best described as pure madness.  They open the
packaging of integrated circuits and&hellip; make stuff work again.  This is like
open-heart surgery&hellip; with a soldering iron.  

I do not wish to be a member of their tribe.  But I do admire them.  From a safe distance.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Yes, it's madness.  But it _might_ be [the Divine Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_madness).

Nope.
