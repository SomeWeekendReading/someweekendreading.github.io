The Russian invasion of Ukraine passed another milestone: 600,000 Russian dead (and counting).  


## Russian Casualties in Ukraine: more, and more, and _more_  

Here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), we've been following for some
time the sad news of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
<sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
<sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup> <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>  

Of course we want to know why casualties fit a linear model in time so well, how
Russia keeps losing ships in a land war against a nation that has no navy, and how a
smaller nation like Ukraine has ended up controlling a couple hundred square kilometers of
Russian territory.  

But our most important question is: _why does this keep going on, and on, and on?!_  

We can only speculate that Putin simply _cannot_ stop, lest he be deposed and executed by
angry Russian oligarchs or organized crime or just other Russian "politicians".  

In the meantime&hellip; 450k dead on 2024-Apr-10, 500k dead on 2024-May-25, and now 600k dead on
2024-Aug-19:

Previously, we built a linear regression model, regressing daily casualty data versus
time, from 2023-Jan-22 to 2023-May-17, they reached 200,000 Russian dead.  The data fit a
linear model _remarkably_ well, almost too much with $R^2 \sim 99.43\%$.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-27-ukraine-600k-regress-DayNum600k-on-Soldiers.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-27-ukraine-600k-regress-DayNum600k-on-Soldiers-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Russian soldiers killed over time in Ukraine: STILL outperforming the trend" title="Russian soldiers killed over time in Ukraine: STILL outperforming the trend" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Let's check in on that model, and review how the later data reports at 450k, 500, and 600k
fall with respect to its prediction.  

That's what we see here:  
- The first 200k casualties are in the lower left in blue, exhibiting eerily smooth linear
  growth.  
- The gray band around the bluepoints is the uncertainty of the fit, i.e., it's very good
  indeed.  
- The 3 red points in the upper right represent the days of 450k, 500k, and 600k
  casualties, respectively.  

The result seems clear: Russian casualties are _above_ trend, growing more than we would
expect from the first 200k deaths.  

It seems that either the Ukrainians, despite being hobbled by throttling of their weapons
supplies, are fighting ever more effectively?  Or, possibly more believably: Russians,
always unafraid to take high casualties are simply throwing conscripts into a meat grinder
for inscrutable reasons of their own?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

If you will forgive me for having a US-centric viewpoint, it seems that a lot of this
hangs on the outcome of the US election.  
- Biden, while honorably supporting the defense of Ukraine, has been hobbled by
  Congressional Republicans trying to cut off funding even at the level of threats of
  US government shutdowns.  
- Perhaps if there is a Democratic trifecta (Presidency, Senate, House), then after
  2025-Jan-20 we might see more weapons and a more decisive outcome in Ukraine.  
  
Anything less than a trifecta will lead to a more equivocal response.  Divided government
will, for now, be crippled government.  
  
Yes, more weapons would lead to more deaths in the short-term.  In the medium term, it
would end the Russian invasion and thus preventing more deaths.  In the long term, it would
shut down the Russian imperialism project and avoid a larger scale war in Europe, thus
preventing horrific numbers of deaths.
