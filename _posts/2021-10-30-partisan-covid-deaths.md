title: The Partisan Divide on COVID-19 Deaths

COVID-19 death rates in the US are nakedly partisan.  So is mask resistance.  So is
delusional beliefs about ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.  Care to draw a conclusion?  


## The partisan divide in death rates

Kieran Healy has done some interesting work relating the COVID-19 death rates in US
counties over time, stratified by deciles of Republican margin over Democrats, reported in
_R bloggers_ and his own blog, as well as a GitHub repository for the data and
code. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

The cumulative death curves here show about what you'd expect:  
- There's an early rise in decile 0, which contains New York City.  It was very much _not_
  Republican, but had early infections before anywhere else.  
- But then the blue deciles got things under control, and the red deciles went wild with
  their own Masque of the Red Death.  
  
We've seen this before [at the state level]({{ site.baseurl }}/politics-vs-mask-and-vaccine-use/)
and [at the county level]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccinations-vs-votes/), where COVID-19
infections and vaccine resistance correlate to conservative Republican votes.  Now we know
it's true of death rates also.  

When your tribal identity pushes you to actions that kill you and your fellow tribe
members, it's time to change tribes.  


## The partisan divide in NPIs

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-30-partisan-covid-deaths-mill-valley-historical-photographs.jpg" width="400" height="159" alt="Historical photo of 1918 pandemic masks in Mill Valley, CA, USA" title="Historical photo of 1918 pandemic masks in Mill Valley, CA, USA" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
We've seen similar results with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like masking and
social distancing, where the irrational declare their refusal to be "muzzled."  

It's no reassurance whatsoever to know that there were similar levels of resistance to
masking during the 1918 flu pandemic.  An article in the _Guardian_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
shows an old photo from California <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> about local mask
mandates.  

The data on the photo says it was taken 1918-Nov-03 by Raymond Coyne, in Mill Valley,
California on Locust Avenue.  I just love lots of historical detail like that, so we 
get a sense of how real it is, that these were _actual people._  

Note that everybody's masked in the photo and one is holding a sign saying,
"WEAR A MASK OR GO TO JAIL".  So mask mandates were quite a controversial thing in those
days, too.  (Ok, the 4th from the left has her mask on below her nose, so that particular
incompetence seems regrettably durable through history.)

## The partisan divide in drug repurposing  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-30-partisan-covid-deaths-nyt.jpg" width="400" height="320" alt="NYT: Fluvoxamine and COVID-19" title="NYT: Fluvoxamine and COVID-19" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

The right are bewilderingly fixated on mirages like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
Both are fine drugs in their usual places, but those places have nothing to do with
COVID-19.  Yet, tribal identity&hellip;  

Now, it's not that drug repurposing is a bad idea.  In fact, it's a _great_ idea to search
the space of already-approved drugs with known safety profiles for activity in new
situations.  I used to work for a company that had an ACE2 inhibitor, that they could
never figure out how to use.  Eventually it was sold, but now that it's known that
SARS-CoV2 binds to the ACE2 receptor, it's suddenly very interesting.

From the _NYT_ comes news <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> of a paper in 
_Lancet Global Health_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> of repurposing the anti-depressant
fluvoxamine.  It's usually used for depression and OCD, but at higher doses it can quell
the cytokine storm caused by COVID-19.  In this case, it reduced the need for
hospitalization by 1/3.  And a 10-day course costs \$4, which is pretty good news.  

They even did a pretty nice Bayesian analysis (under both 
[ITT and mITT conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention-to-treat_analysis)) of the
probability of infection for each arm of the trial, and the risk ratio.  That's exactly
how I would have done it, so I like these guys, just so you know my bias.  

Good result: existing drug, known safety profile, cheap, pretty effective.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The thing about conspiracy theories is, they are generally false.  Believing them about
important matters _can get you killed._
