title: The Partisan Divide on COVID-19 Deaths

COVID-19 death rates in the US are nakedly partisan.  So is mask resistance.  So is
delusional belief about nonsensical use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.  Care to
draw a conclusion?  


## The partisan divide in death rates

#000000;"> Kieran Healy has done some interesting work relating the COVID-19 death rates
in US counties over time, stratified by deciles of Republican margin over Democrats,
reported in _R bloggers_ and his own blog, as well as a GitHub repository for the data and
code. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

The cumulative death curves here show about what you'd expect:  
- There's an early rise in decile 0, which contains New York City.  It was very much _not_
  Republican.  But it had early infections before anywhere else, largely due to more extensive
  international connections in the blue areas.  
- But then the blue deciles got things under control, while the red deciles went wild with
  their own [Masque of the Red Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Masque_of_the_Red_Death).  
  
We've seen this before
[at the state level by our own analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}/politics-vs-mask-and-vaccine-use/)
and
[at the county level by an analysis due to Charles Gaba]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccinations-vs-votes/).
COVID-19 infections and vaccine resistance correlate to conservative Republican votes.
Now we know that this is also true of death rates.  

The Twitter commentariat was even more put out about this than me:

## The partisan divide in NPIs

We've seen similar results with non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like masking and
social distancing, where the irrational declare their refusal to be "muzzled."  

It's no reassurance whatsoever to know that there were similar levels of resistance to
masking during the 1918 flu pandemic.  An article in the _Guardian_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
shows an old photo from California <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> about local mask
mandates.  

<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=locust+avenue%2C+mill+valley+california" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-30-partisan-covid-deaths-mill-valley-map.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="Today: Locust Avenue, Mill Valley CA, USA" title="Today: Locust Avenue, Mill Valley CA, USA" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The data on the photo says it was taken 1918-Nov-03 by Raymond Coyne in Mill Valley,
California on Locust Avenue.  That street apparently still exists today, a bit over a
century later.  I just love historical detail like that, so we can get a sense of how
real this was, a step closer to the
[_ding an sich_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing-in-itself), with an emotional
understanding that these were _actual people._  

Note that everybody's masked in the photo and one is holding a sign saying,
"WEAR A MASK OR GO TO JAIL".  So mask mandates were quite a controversial thing in those
days, too.  (Ok, the 4th from the left has her mask on below her nose, so that particular
incompetence seems regrettably durable through history.)

## The partisan divide in drug repurposing  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-30-partisan-covid-deaths-nyt.jpg" width="400" height="320" alt="NYT: Fluvoxamine and COVID-19" title="NYT: Fluvoxamine and COVID-19" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-30-partisan-covid-deaths-lancet.jpg" width="400" height="185" alt="Lancet: Fluvoxamine and COVID-19" title="Lancet: Fluvoxamine and COVID-19" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The right are bewilderingly fixated on mirages like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
Both are fine drugs in their usual places, but those places have nothing to do with
COVID-19.  In the case of ivermectin, the alleged positive studies seem to have been faked;
the rest were either bungled designs or murky results.  Yet, tribal identity&hellip;  

Now, it's not that drug repurposing is a bad idea.  In fact, it's a _great_ idea to search
the space of already-approved drugs with known safety profiles for activity in new
situations.  I had a project once called the "sleeping beauties" where we looked at all of
our clinically proven-safe molecules to see if they had activities in other areas,
especialy cancers.  I even used to work for a company that had an ACE2 inhibitor that they could
never quite figure out how to use.  Eventually it was sold, but now that it's known that
SARS-CoV2 binds to the ACE2 receptor in the lungs, it's suddenly very interesting.

From the _NYT_ comes news <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> of a paper in 
_Lancet Global Health_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> of repurposing the anti-depressant
fluvoxamine.  It's usually used for depression and OCD, but at higher doses it can quell
the cytokine storm caused by COVID-19 (apparently it has a lot of off targets?).  In this
case, it reduced the need for hospitalization by 1/3.  And a 10-day course costs \$4,
which is pretty good news.  

They even did a pretty nice Bayesian analysis (under both
[ITT (top) and mITT (bottom) conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention-to-treat_analysis))
of the probability of infection for each arm of the trial (left), and the risk ratio
(right).  That's exactly how I would have done it.  I like these guys (just so you know my bias).  

It's a good result:  
- existing approved &amp; available drug, 
- known favorable safety profile, 
- cheap, and 
- pretty effective at changing course away from hospitalization for a patient with unmet medical
  need.  

Just about the perfect example!  In this regard, it's a bit like dexamethasone, which
helps similarly.  (And _not_ much at all like remdesivir, which was not approved &amp;
limited availability, has an incompletely understood safety profile, is hideously
expensive, and didn't work all that much.)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The thing about conspiracy theories is, they are generally false.  Believing them about
life-or-death matters _can get you killed._
