Today I found out that I missed out a bit by getting my PhD anywhere but Finland.  


## Yes, Finland  

For some reason, news items of beautiful, largely senseless things in Finland keep finding
their way to me.  I'm not even remotely of Finnish ancestry, so I really don't know why
this happens.  Maybe so I can make my friends of Finnish ancestry happy?  (That would
actually be a fairly _good_ reason!)  

For example, [last December we wrote about a mad Finnish architect obsessed with creating
beautiful, though ephemeral, snow sculptures]({{ site.baseurl }}/winter-beauty/).  

Today, it came to my attention that when you get a PhD in Finland, they give you a
doctoral top hat and a sword:

    When you get a PhD in Finland, you receive a doctoral top hat and sword, tailored to
    your discipline. Both will be used in your conferment ceremony (pictured).

I checked this out with a bunch of other people, who confirmed the story and showed
pictures of their swords.  Smells pretty real to me.  

I'm pretty sure it isn't given immediately after passing the thesis defense.  Giving grad students the
grilling of their lives and then handing them an edged weapon seems like&hellip; a
poor survival strategy.  

All I got was a hood, a diploma, and then shown the door, releasing me from jail.  (And
that felt pretty good at the time, but&hellip; _a sword!_)
