Today is Pi Day (3/14) in 2023.  Sort of.  

## Pi Day?  

Well, of course, it depends on your date notation!
- 3/14 sort of makes sense (in decimal), but 3/14/2023 most emphatically does not.  
- And the American notation of MM/DD/YYYY is also crazy from the start.  Clearly you should
  either go in increasing or decreasing order of granularity:  
  o DD/MM/YYYY (as in Europe) or  
  o YYYY/MM/DD (as in the ISO standard).  
  But neither of those expresses _&pi;_ very well, beyond 3 significant digits.  
  
The Correct Way, of course, has nothing to do with decimal digits: either continued
fractions in the Way of Gosper, or binary if you _must_ have a polynomial expansion, or at
least with real pie.  [As we wrote 2 years ago]({{ site.baseurl }}/pi-day), here on this
Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads:

(Why has nobody ever built Gosper continued fraction hardware as an alternative to
floating point?  Is it because of the exponents?)

Of course, no Pi Day would be complete without a quick visit to the inimitable Vi Hart,
who always has, by definition, The Most Interesting Opinions.  (This one apparently
involves General Relativity and observable amounts of curvature influencing _&pi;._)  

I mean, anybody who can talk their friends into
[playing homemade cardboard instruments in a quintet _while they are set on fire_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caFMauLQvd4)
is&hellip; well, at the very least quite persuasive!  Possibly frighteningly so.
