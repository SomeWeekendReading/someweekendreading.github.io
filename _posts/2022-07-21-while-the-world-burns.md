Everybody (well, every non-Republican) in the US is mad at Democratic Senator Manchin for
being the vote blocking any meaningful climate change legislation at all.  Well&hellip; there are a
few _other_ things to be mad about, right?  


## Really?  What else?

Paul Krugman writing a the _NYT_ is our guide today. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

He points out that, yes, there are many reasons to be angry with Manchin:  
- Manchin has just pulled the plug on US efforts to do just about _anything_ about climate
  change.  
- He's the gadfly who stopped the Biden's Build Back Better plan for post-COVID recovery.  
- He personally profits from a coal business, exactly the sort of thing that should be
  shut down in favor of solar, wind, and nuclear.  
- He negotiates in bad faith, asking for compromise after compromise before finally
  refusing to cooperate.  
  
So, yeah: pretty irritating guy.  He's only of interest for 2 reasons:  
- In an evenly divided Senate, we cannot lose _even a single vote_ to get things passed.
  Manchin, realizing this, plays _prima donna_ to solicit as much change in his favor as
  he can manage.  
- West Virginia is deep red.  So when Manchin goes, he will almost certainly be replaced by
  an even more despicable Republican.  
  
But, as Krugman points out, this misses an important point: the 50 Republican senators,
marching with goose-step precision against clean energy (or really _anything_ of public
benefit).  In a few months, either Democrats will gain a few more Senators, or Republicans
will take control of the Senate.  Either way, Manchin will then be irrelevant.  His
relevance is a creature of the finely balanced Senate and his last-Democrat status in West
Virginia.  

Manchin is small potatoes, compared to the deep and uniform Republican hostility to clean
energy, fighting climate change, pandemic preparedness, or anything else that benefits
mere people.  

Here's the problem, in Krugman's summary (__emphasis__ added, since I'm a scientist):  

> The fact is that one of America’s two major political parties appears to be viscerally
> opposed to any policy that seems to serve the public good. __Overwhelming scientific
> consensus in favor of such policies doesn’t help — if anything, it hurts, because the
> modern G.O.P. is hostile to science and scientists.__  
>  
> And that hostility, rather than the personal quirks of one small-state senator, is the
> fundamental reason we appear set to do nothing while the planet burns.  

Republican areas refuse vaccination, and thus die at higher rates.  While the planet
burns.  

Why does _anyone_ vote Republican, for any _imaginable_ office, under any _conceivable_
circumstance?!
