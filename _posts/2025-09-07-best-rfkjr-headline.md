Usually headlines are just annoying, but once in a great while they're _perfect._  


## It's All Summed Up in 4 Words  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-07-best-rfkjr-headline-variety-1.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="McCall @ Variety, 1935: A headline eclipses the article it's supposed to highlight" title="McCall @ Variety, 1935: A headline eclipses the article it's supposed to highlight" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
On 1935-Jul-17, the Hollywood-focused newspaper _Variety_ wrote one of its most famous
headlines, traditionally repetitive rhyming words rendering the meaning almost
inscrutable.  In saying that rural filmgoers of the day had no interest in films about
rural life, they memorably wrote <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

> Sticks Nix Hick Pix  

Meaning: people who live in rural areas ("the sticks") say no to ("nix") rural-focused
movies ("hick pix").  It manages to be completely insulting, both to rural people as well as
reflexively to the _Variety_ headline editors themselves ("we're dumb enough we actually
say this").  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-07-best-rfkjr-headline-nyt-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-07-best-rfkjr-headline-nyt-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="487" alt="Dowd @ NYT: Vax Quack Lacks Facts" title="Dowd @ NYT: Vax Quack Lacks Facts" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
A couple days ago, Maureen Dowd writing at _The New York Times_ has achieved a similar
degree of perspicuity, summing up the pig-headed ignorance around vaccines of 
RFKJr in just 4 words <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>:  

> Vax Quack Lacks Facts  

(Be sure to click through to see the archival picture of a polio victim in an iron lung.
It's hard to convey to people today how _terrifying_ polio was to my elders when I was a
kid in the 50s and 60s.  As a little kid, I only understood that if I got the polio
vaccine, then it would be possible to go to the beach in August, which was the best beach
month.  Since then, I've grown to realize what a monster we dodged with the polio
vaccines.)  

This is personal for Dowd, since she almost died of rubella when she was 3 years old.
It'd a bit personal for me as well, since I also had rubella at the beginning of first
grade (though in that time and place it was called "German measles").  It meant that when I
went back to school, everybody else understood "how school works", and I did _not._

And last spring, here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, we got MMR boosters
(measles/mumps/rubella) along with COVID-19 boosters.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
Because the anti-vax knuckleheads have loosed again the most contagious disease known to
humanity, measles, which has no treatment but is easily preventable.  Given the high $R_0$
for measles, you need about 95% of the population to be vaccinated to prevent outbreaks.  

Dowd points out that we are bringing _needless_ dangers down upon our children's heads:  

> Between school shooters and R.F.K. Jr., children in America are vulnerable in ways they
> don’t have to be. Officials are endangering children instead of shielding them.  
 
- Kennedy has impounded \$500 million in grants for mRNA vaccine research and manufacturing
  of mRNA vaccines.  
- Then Kennedy impounded a \$600 million grant for vaccines for bird flu, which looks to
  be quite deadly if it ever hops to human hosts.  
- In a measles outbreak in Texas, Kennedy promoted vitamin A and cod liver oil on Fox
  news; subsequently, several unvaccinated children were hospitalized for liver damage from
  overdosing on those.  
- In 2019, Kennedy claimed to Samoans that the MMR vaccine caused the deaths of infants.
  The subsequent measles outbreak killed 83 Samoans and 500 Tongans.  
- Before testifying before Congress last week, he _did not bother to be briefed_ by CDC
  experts, especially on COVID-19 and measles.  He got his ideas from other cranks,
  instead.  
  
Yes, he lacks facts.  

No, he does not lack for blood on his hands.  (Children's blood, in case that matters to you.)  


## It's Not Just RFKJr  

Of course, it's not _just_ RFKJr.  He's got a whole posse of anti-vax weirdos in local
positions of power.  Whether he inspires them &amp; sets them loose or whether they are
just as a group committed to death is not particularly important.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-07-best-rfkjr-headline-ars-1.jpg" width="400" height="505" alt="Mole @ Ars Technica: Florida surgeon general calls for end to vaccines, preventable disease is 'just part of life'" title="Mole @ Ars Technica: Florida surgeon general calls for end to vaccines, preventable disease is 'just part of life'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Case in point: the Florida surgeon general Joseph Ladapo has announced his intent to end
_all_ school vaccination requirements. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  This includes
even the _obviously_ important ones like Hib, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, tetanus, RSV,
and _even polio._  

He thinks, and I am using the verb 'think' here very loosely, that
_vaccine mandates are like slavery:_  

> Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery.  

Defining down slavery is an&hellip; _interesting_ position for a Black man in the US to
take!  

He's got a long history of being anti-vaccine and spreading misinformation.  He was
previously smacked down by the FDA and CDC, before Republicans neutered them.  For
example, he pushed the de-worming drug ivermectin against COVID-19.  He's been credibly
accused of altering data, to make analyses show mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 did various bad
things.  

And yet&hellip; this is what Republicans _want:_ ignorant policies, dishonestly presented,
which will only cause deaths.  One wonders if the political virtue signaling will be worth
it to them.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Honestly, we're in such a bad place I barely even know how to _describe_ it.  The correct
solution, of course, is a change of government and very many criminal trials and
convictions of the band of grifters in power.  

In the meantime&hellip; "Vax Quack Lacks Facts" is a regrettably accurate summary.
