title: Is 'natural' immunity any better than vaccine immunity to COVID-19?

Periodically, anti-vaxxers will say they prefer the 'natural' immunity acquired by
recovering from a disease, because vaccines are 'artificial'.  Is that likely to be true
for COVID-19?  In a word: NO.  


## 'Natural' immunity isn't as great as you think it is

The experience of having a disease is miserable, sometimes maiming or fatal.  For going
through that, you usually get immunity.  Usually.  Sometimes you get the reverse, called
_immune amnesia_.  Measles, for example, can reset your immune system so you _lose_
immumity for a couple years to everything _except_ the measles you just had.
<sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> That, combined with the miserably high infectivity of measles
($R_0 \sim 12 - 18$) <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, emphasizes
_how important it is to get MMR vaccinations for your kids._  And yourselves, for that
matter.  


## What's the efficacy of 'natural' immunity to COVID-19?  

Generally speaking, that's the way the trade-offs go: vaccines are almost always the
low-risk way to go to get disease immunity, at least compared to getting sick with the
disease itself.  What do we know about how this will shake out for COVID-19?

Last week, a press release from _Public Health England_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>,
an agency of the UK government, gave us the answer.  This was confirmed by reporting from
the _British Medical Journal_, in a news report by Elisabeth Mahase 
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>.  

They're looking at the SIREN study 
<sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, which looked at infection rates in healthcare workers in
the UK.  SIREN compared infection rates in antibody-positive subjects (presumably recovered
from COVID-19) to antibody-negative subjects (presumed COVID-19 na&iuml;ve).  

The general conclusion of the SIREN study, the scientific source for all this reporting, is:  

> __Interpretation__ A prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an __83%
> lower risk of infection__, with median protective effect observed five months following
> primary infection. This is the minimum likely effect as seroconversions were not
> included.

So, to summarize:  
- Going through the harrowing, life-threatening, hospital-breaking experience of getting COVID-19
  gets you immunity with __83% efficacy.__(Probably higher, because of unmeasured seroconversion.)  
- Going through only moderate aches &amp; pains, imposing minimal burden on the 
  healthcare system by getting a vaccination with the Moderna/Lonza or Pfizer/BioNTech
  vaccine gets you immunity with __95% efficacy.__  

For the mathematically disinclined, we would like to point out that 95% &gt; 83%.  


## The moral of this story  

When your turn comes up, _get vaccinated!_  


## Added 2021-Jan-19: Masks _alone_, properly worn, give 70% - 80% efficacy  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-01-16-natural-vs-vaccine-immunity-PNAS.jpg" width="400" height="339" alt="PNAS: Proper wearing of masks has prevention efficacy ~ 70% - 80%" title="PNAS: Proper wearing of masks has prevention efficacy ~ 70% - 80%" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
A review of the effect of mask-wearing on COVID-19 just published in the _Proceedings of
the National Academy of Sciences_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> rather helpfully points
out that using face masks can get you efficacies for preventing COVID-19 of around 70%,
and as much as 80% _if you just follow the instructions and wear them properly:_

> Overall, evidence from RCTs and observational studies is informative, but not compelling
> on its own. Both the Australian influenza RCT and the Beijing households observational
> trial found __around 80% efficacy among compliant subjects__, and the one SARS household
> study of sufficient power found 70% efficacy for protecting the wearer.  

Wearing a mask _properly_ means _over your nose too_.  [In the (regrettably now-immortal) words of NY Gov Andrew Cuomo, if you wear the mask under your nose, "That's not a mask.  That's a chin strap.  Nobody told you to wear a chin strap."](https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1282367186221314054)  Don't be a dope about this.  

You can get 80% immunity if you _wear your mask properly when out of your home_, and
that's almost as good as the 83% immunity you get from the agonizing process of having
COVID-19 itself.  

Neither is as good as 95% immunity from the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, so _get vaccinated._
