How thorough are vaccination rates in the US?  And how geographically inhomogeneous?  


## US vaccination rates: very local, very political  

[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about an _NYT_ map showing
the vaccination rates on a state-by-state basis.  It looked like (a) the overall
vaccination rates are still quite low, and (b) quite geographically inhomogeneous.

The _New York Times_ publishes data on this, periodically updated. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
I looked at the data as of 2022-Jun-15, and at the county level to get a more fine-grained
sense of the geographical distribution, in the snapshot shown here.  

Some thoughts:  
- The US vaccination numbers are, as expected, abysmally low for 2.5 years into a
  pandemic, for which multiple vaccines are safe, effect, free, and widely available.  We
  are: 32% fully vaccinated and boosted, 35% fully vaccinated but not boosted, 11%
  partially vaccinated, and 22% not vaccinated.  
- It's _not_ evenly geographically distributed, and seems to correlate extremely well with
  Republican/Trumpist politics:  
  - Here in the fastness of New England, I'm quite content with our vaccination rates.
    (Though puzzled why Vermont is not reporting county-level data.)  
  - The Eastern seaboard, the Florida coasts (highly populated by Eatern seaboard
    retirees), and the California coast are all in pretty decent shape.  
  - I'm slightly surprised that the Texas border along the Rio Grande is doing so much
    better than the misery in the rest of Texas.  
  - The Four Corners counties in Arizona and New Mexico are spectacular.  This is a result
    of the excellent public health management on the part of the Native American
    communities there,
    [as we've previously noted with great satisfaction]({{ site.baseurl }}/highest-vax-group-in-us/).  
  - The south and the mountain west, being bastions of conservative nonsense, are as
    expected working very hard to keep their citizens miserable.

Charles Gaba is still right <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, as we've said numerous times
before.  His excellent data, at the latest update as of 2022-Jun-10, still shows the
negative effect of Republican politics (which is itself correlated with rural locales, as
Republicans have learned minority rule by having enough territory to overcome their
minority of total voters):  
- The negative slope of the line documents the negative impact of Republican voting
  patterns on vaccination rates.  
- The size of the circles indicates population of a county, so we see that there is a
  negative effect from rural counties as well.
