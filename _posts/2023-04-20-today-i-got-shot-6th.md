Today I got my 6th COVID-19 vaccination.  Here's why, in case you're interested.  


## What happened this week in the US COVID-19 vaccine world?

Seems like we've been getting a _lot_ of vaccinations here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend!
Since 2020, I've personally gotten 13 vaccinations: 6 COVID-19 + 3 flu + 2 shingles + 
1 TDaP + 1 pneumonia.  Today was the latest of those, a booster of the bivalent classic/Omicron
COVID-19 vaccine.  

Let's look at what's happened in US COVID-19 vaccination news to see why.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-fda-1.jpg" width="400" height="326" alt="FDA News Release: Authorizing a bivalent booster" title="FDA News Release: Authorizing a bivalent booster" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
There have, of course, been rumors for some months (as far back as late Feb/early Mar)
that a spring 2023 booster was a possibility.  After all, they've already authorized it in
the UK and Canada.  But all the reports were general media without sourcing to scientific
papers or regulatory bodies, and from reporters who had no particular qualifications that
I could easily discern.  Maybe I need to read from better sources?  

However, this week it happened.  Slightly strangely, I first heard of it in general media,
which I then tracked back to the FDA news release. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  A few
high points:  
- This did _not_ include a meeting of the VRBPAC (Vaccine and Related Biological Products
  Advisory Committee) advisory committee.  If that had happened, I would have been able to
  dig into a pile of presentations full of data.  So they just went ahead and did it,
  without external advice.  More on this below.  
- This was done as an amendment to the Emergency Use Authorization for the bivalent
  vaccines of both Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.  Unlike the monovalent vaccines, these are
  still under EUA, so it had to be this way.  
- They completely eliminated the requirement to have the monovalent vaccine before the
  bivalent one, since the monovalent one is less useful vs Omicron anyway.  This is
  sensible, though the slow speed at which it was done is not very sensible.  So, overdue
  but good.  But anybody still unvaccinated (why?!) will now _start_ with the bivalent
  vaccines.  
- There are still some complex rules around pediatric use, given that the Pfizer and
  Moderna pediatric trials were differently designed. 
- __The important bit:__ Anybody of 65 years old or immunocompromised who got a bivalent
  booster last fall is eligible for a spring booster now.  Most people will get an annual
  booster in the fall, with a spring booster available for elders and immunocompromised
  people.  

Thus, they've both authorized a spring booster for elders and immunocompromised,
deprecated the now less useful monovalent vaccines, and simplified the rules for who gets
what and when, based on risk exposure.  

It looks like the J&amp;J vaccine is pretty much dead in the US.  The Novavax
protein-based vaccine continues to struggle to show much advantage.

This was then widely reported by various general news sources, most of which seemed to be
pretty accurate, if simplified. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
<sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  I often lean toward NPR, _NYT_, _WaPo_ for general news.
But if you want short, then start with the Reuters report.  Helen Branswell at _STAT News_
has done her usual fabulous job as well, giving a more detailed and deeply informed view.  

But, of course, there's nothing like the primary source, which in this case is the FDA
release above.  


## Why they might have done that  

Ok, but&hellip; I have questions:  
- Why was there no VRBPAC meeting with presentations to the FDA?  
- Why is a booster relevant now, in terms of risks of hospitalization and death?  
- What are the alternatives, now that no antibody infusions work anymore (even Evusheld)?  

So lets's look at each of those in turn.

### Why no VRBPAC?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-fda-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-fda-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="362" alt="FDA Advisory Committee Meetings: There was no VRBPAC meeting" title="FDA Advisory Committee Meetings: There was no VRBPAC meeting" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
How do we know there was no VRBPAC meeting to advise the FDA?  Because we looked at their
schedule <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>, part of which is snapshotted here.  Since the
FDA announcement above was 2023-Apr-18, we'd normally expect the VRBPAC meeting to have
been shortly prior to that.  As you can see (click to embiggen), there was no such meeting
and we didn't just miss it.  

So why did the usually cautious FDA not do a VRBPAC?  It's a bit of a guess, but I can see
at least 2 reasons:  

1. A spring bivalent booster has already been approved abroad, e.g., in the UK and Canada.  <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>  That means, among other things, the FDA has _their_ approval data available to inspect, and needn't duplicate the effort.  (I haven't personally checked, since I've no idea how to navigate the health regulatory agencies of those countries.)  
2. Also, there was a previous VRBPAC on 2023-Jan-10, about which [we blogged at the time]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes/) <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>, on exactly this issue: composition of vaccines going forward and criteria for issuing a new booster.  Provided this is reasonably in line with those plans, another VRBPAC may have been judged unnecessary.  

### What's the risk-based need for a booster now?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-nejm-1.jpg" width="400" height="136" alt="Lin &amp; Sunny @ NEJM: Durability of bivalent boosters vs Omicron variants" title="Lin &amp; Sunny @ NEJM: Durability of bivalent boosters vs Omicron variants" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-nejm-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-nejm-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="526" alt="Lin &amp; Sunny @ NEJM: Durability of bivalent boosters vs Omicron variants, various infection outcomes" title="Lin &amp; Sunny @ NEJM: Durability of bivalent boosters vs Omicron variants, various infection outcomes" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Is there a risk-based story here, i.e., an observable waning of protection and associated
risk roughly 6 months after the last bivalent vaccination?  

There are quite a few studies here, so I'll just concentrate on one of them which studies
the durability of various vaccine efficacies both over time and across various viral
variants.  It's a very brief couple-page letter to the editor of the _New England Journal
of Medicine_. <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>  

Consider their Figure 1, which summarizes things:  
- The left column looks at persistence of 4 kinds of efficacy (infection, hospitalization,
  hospitalization or death, and death) vs time.  
- The right column does something similar, but doesn't put all the initial vaccination
  dates at 0.  Instead, by basing each curve on the calendar date, we get to compare
  efficacy with the various viral variants that were common at that time.  
- Looking at the left column, we see that protection against infection has pretty much
  disappeared by 16 weeks (4 months).  Sterilizing levels of antibodies are too low for
  that.  
- However, we also see that protection against hospitalization and death, while reduced,
  persist quite a bit more.  You might get infected, but you're less likely to die.  This
  is because once an infection happens, the body can spin up antibody production to fight
  it off.  
- Looking at the right hand column, we compare the red and blue curves to see that the
  general levels of efficacy persist across viral variants.  This is good, since we can
  discount the hypothesis that the experiment would not reproduce if tried at another
  time, with different variants.  

### What's the story on antibody infusions?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-reuters-2.jpg" width="400" height="193" alt="Fick @ Reuters: AstraZeneca new ab infusion likely works against all known variants" title="Fick @ Reuters: AstraZeneca new ab infusion likely works against all known variants" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Previously, we had antibody infusions for treatment like bebtelovimab and
long-persistence antibodies like Evusheld for prevention.  Those are both great, and
probably saved the life of a family member.  

However, none of those work any more, in the era of Omicron.  

In a bit of (occasional) news, AstraZeneca now has a new antibody
<sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup> which appears to be effective.  AZD3152 is not approved yet,
but _probably_ by the end of this year.  

Ok, good news&hellip; but&hellip; it's still the case that there are no treatment
alternatives for people who get infected, at least for a while.  _With luck,_ that may
change by the end of the year.  In the meantime, we need prevention&hellip; i.e., a
booster.  


## How about the CDC?  

As apparently everyone knows by now, the FDA and CDC have different roles:  
- The FDA decides what's scientifically true, i.e., whether a proposed treatment is both
  _safe_ and _effective_.  
- The CDC looks at that, and if the FDA review is favorable, sets recommended standards
  for patient treatment.  It's more pragmatic than scientific.  

So&hellip; what did the CDC have to say about this FDA finding for boosters?  The CDC's
ACIP (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice) met the very next day, which is
gratifyingly fast.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-cdc-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-cdc-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="472" alt="CDC ACIP Meeting Agend: NB no voting items?!" title="CDC ACIP Meeting Agend: NB no voting items?!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
But their agenda was curious!  <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>  Note on the agenda,
reproduced here, that there was _no opportunity for a vote!_  Why would you convene an
external advisory committee and _not_ ask them for a recommendation?  

Perhaps&hellip; you just want to look for red flags. These vaccines have been reviewed
about as much as any medication has _ever_ been reviewed.  Absent any red flags, you'll
approve the booster.  It would be nice if we could accept an ACIP vote without prejudice,
but if we really have a default toward acceptance, this might be a sort-of-ok way to do
this.  

<a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell/status/1648710726113013762"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-stat-2.jpg" width="550" height="753" alt="H Branswell @ STAT: Twitter thread on CDC ACIP meeting on boosters" title="H Branswell @ STAT: Twitter thread on CDC ACIP meeting on boosters" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Now, given that the FDA has already approved this without a VRBPAC, we're not gonna go
through the whole CDC ACIP meeting.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-cdc-2.jpg" width="400"
height="306" alt="CDC Official Annoucement" title="CDC Official Annoucement" style="float:
right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Fortunately, the redoubtable Helen Branswell of _STAT News_ has live-tweeted the entire
CDC ACIP meeting.  I'm not going through all that, but she's got what is apparently a
pretty good summary.  

At the end of the day, the CDC agreed with the FDA: older adults and the immunocompromised
should  <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup> get a bivalent booster.  


## What to do about it  

So we've seen that:
1. The national health authorities of the Canada, the UK, and the US have
   all authorized another bivalent Omicron booster for the elderly and the
   immunocompromised.  
2. There is ample evidence of a 4-6 month waning against Omicron, depending on what sort
   of protection you measure.  
3. We're over 65 here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend (or at least soon will be), about 6 months
   has elapsed since [our last bivalent vax]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot-12th-time/),
   and our personal cost of having COVID-19 last August was high cognitive
   impairment that persists until today.  
   
That's general availability, evidence of broad need, and evidence of personal need.  

The correct course of action is, of course, quite obvious: get the booster.  Now the
Weekend Editrix is (a) in Japan, and (b) a hair too young.  The Weekend Publisher couldn't
be convinced to focus, and there are no feline vaccines yet.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-hypo.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-hypo-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="Your humble weekend editor's left dorsal tentacle getting another jab" title="Your humble weekend editor's left dorsal tentacle getting another jab" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
So, just me then.  It was relatively straightforward: I used the government vaccine finder
web site, which pointed me at several CVS's within a couple miles of Ch&acirc;teau
Weekend.  So clicking through, it unfortunately took me to the _national_ web site for CVS
and I had to re-enter a bunch of stuff.  But it pretty quickly recognized me and gave me a
same-day 5pm appointment.  

I got there about an hour early, and asked if they had a spot, since it wasn't especially
busy.  They said "Sure, have a seat", and about 10 minutes later a very friendly pharmacist
gave me the Moderna bivalent booster.  (I have a slight favorable attitude toward Moderna,
since it's dosed a bit higher than Pfizer.  But that's over-optimization on my part; just
use whichever one's available to you.)  

And here's the photographic evidence of my hairy dorsal manipulator tentacle getting a 6th
COVID-19 vaccination since 2021.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-weekend-publisher.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-04-20-today-i-got-shot-6th-weekend-publisher-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="The Weekend Publisher, on guard duty vs the horde of wild turkeys" title="The Weekend Publisher, on guard duty vs the horde of wild turkeys" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
As you can see here, the Weekend Publisher is nonplussed with all this, preferring to
remain on guard duty against the horde of wild turkeys so rudely stalking about his back
yard.  

While I admire his nonchalance, the rational way to attain that nonchalance is to take all
the sensible precautions that science and common sense dictate.  For us, that meant
getting the boost when available.  

Maybe you should think about doing likewise?  


## Addendum 2023-Apr-21: Side effects  

Really not so bad.  I was tired last night, and my arm was a little sore.  Today I got up
_really_ tired, and a little achy.  No fever, though.  

Probably the easiest of the 13 vaccinations I've had since 2020.  (6 COVID-19 + 3
influenza + 2 shingles + 1 TDaP + 1 pneumonia, in case you want the complete score.)
