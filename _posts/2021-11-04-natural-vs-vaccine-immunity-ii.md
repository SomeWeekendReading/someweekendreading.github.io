Last summer, we saw some evidence that
[COVID-19 vaccination conferred better immunity](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/vax-better/)
than 'natural' immunity from recovering from the disease.  How has that held up in the
face of new evidence?  


## Comparing 'natural' and vaccinated immuities

A few days ago came a study from the
CDC <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> which compared
COVID-19 infection rates in people who were vaccinated _vs_ people who had recovered from
a previous COVID-19 infection.  Any material value of the risk ratio different from 1
would be evidence that one or the other was superior.  

_NB:_ This is _not_ just a measurement of antibody levels, as was 
[the previous study we examined](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/vax-better/).  That's
convenient to do, and fast, but is only a narrow slice through the complexity of
immunity.  What we have here is a full-up empirical study of humans in the wild, going
about their lives &mdash; and that's the most useful data to have so you can figure out
what will happen to _you_, going about _your_ life.  


## The view from 10,000 feet  

The study examined persons older than 18 who were hospitalized for COVID-19 symptoms.
They were either fully vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine in the last 3-6 months, or had
already had documented COVID-19 within the last 3-6 months.  About 9,000 people were
evaluated &ndash; this is not a tiny study, but almost the size of the original COVID-19
vaccine clinical trials!  

__Result:__ Unvaccinated people had a risk of reinfection that was _higher_ by 5.49 fold
(95% confidence limit: 2.75 &ndash; 10.99).  

Note that the risk ratio there is bounded away from 1 by the 95% confidence limit, i.e.,
we're really sure this is a real thing and not just by chance.

So we previously thought vaccine-induced immunity was probably better.  Now we have to
revise our opinion: vaccine-induced immunity is more than _5 times better!_  


## So what?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-11-04-natural-vs-vaccine-immunity-ii-cdc-3.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="CDC Recommendation: Vaccination is 5x better than 'natural' immunity" title="CDC Recommendation: Vaccination is 5x better than 'natural' immunity" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Predictably, though also _responsibly,_ CDC administration used this as yet another reason
to encourage vaccination:  

> "We now have additional evidence that reaffirms the importance of COVID-19 vaccines,
> even if you have had prior infection. This study adds more to the body of knowledge
> demonstrating the protection of vaccines against severe disease from COVID-19. __The best
> way to stop COVID-19, including the emergence of variants, is with widespread COVID-19
> vaccination and with disease prevention actions such as mask wearing, washing hands
> often, physical distancing, and staying home when sick__," said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle
> P. Walensky.  

Isn't it about time we start listening to this excellent advice?
