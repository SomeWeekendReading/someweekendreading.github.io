[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) if I'm dead, given the lack
of posts here for 4 months.  It's not _prima facie_ an unreasonable question.  


## Nope

Not dead yet.

That's going to be our new motto, here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend: not dead yet, or "nondum
mortua" for those wanting to blazon a Weekend Escutcheon.

Though, to be fair, there are times the notion has been thought through.  It's been a bit
of a rough time:  
- Long COVID, now officially diagnosed, continues to plague me with brain fog.  Honestly,
  it's how I imagine it would be if I suddenly lost 20-30 IQ points and all ability to
  focus or concentrate.  I have an attention span comparable to my cats.  

  (As you can see from the picture, showing the Weekend Publisher, and his apprentice the
  Assistant Weekend Publisher, ensconced in their executive chair, the cats greet this with
  complete aplomb.)  
- The Weekend Editrix acquired her 2nd case of COVID-19, due to a packed return flight
  from Japan with people coughing.  Yes, she was carefully masked, but in a confined space
  for that long with dubious air quality handling&hellip; it was more or less inevitable.  

  For another time, I'll tell the tale of the flaming hoops through which one must now
  jump to get paxlovid, the stone-stupid prejudices against it being what they are.  
- I've managed to injure myself.  While walking on some ice, the muscles in my left thigh
  decided to be sprained, and I mean _really_ sprained.  I went down &amp; couldn't get
  back up.  Docs say no fracture, but wait for swelling to go down to assess tendon
  damage.  
  
  In the meantime, I walk at best porly and have acquired an Old Man Cane and a
  stoic attitude about pain management. (Though that's not so bad.  If this is a permanent
  thing, I'm gonna get an oak cane made with some equations from my papers carved into it,
  and a replaceable handle with, say, a laser pointer.)  
- We changed health insurance from the Medicare Advantage forced upon us by my former
  employer to an Original Medicare + Medigap Supplement + Part D plan to remove one layer
  of officious and unwanted insurance supervision.  About the same cost,
  but then I tend to want gold-plated health insurance becaues I like risk avoidance.  

  That has caused no end of problems switching over, getting all the auto-payments set up,
  getting hospitals and doctors to pay attention, and so on.  More about the travails of
  the American health insurance system later.  (Soon, with venom.)  
 

## The Weekend Conclusion  

So, we're working through some stuff here.  

The good news is that the "working through" part is _working_, or so it seems.  

Valentine's Day will be a dinner at home (though a nice one with some lobster and
fondue).  

In the meantime, I've got a backlog of proposed articles I want to write, and about a
bajillion open browser tabs pointing at provocative subjects about which I may have a
thing or two to say.  Brain fog permitting, I'll try to get to those.  

_Heartfelt advice:_ COVID-19 really did a number on me; don't get COVID-19.  Get as
vaccinated as you can and avoid crowded indoor situations of questionable ventilation.

Nope.
