Somehow we've stumbled into striking down mask mandates.  Who did that?  AND is it ok,
with the next wave situation of SARS-CoV2?  Do you even have to guess?  


## Striking Down the Mask Mandates  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-02-no-masks-new-wave-nyt-1.jpg" width="400" height="249" alt="Murphy &amp; Savage @ NYT: Who ended the travel mask mandate?" title="Murphy &amp; Savage @ NYT: Who ended the travel mask mandate?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Let's start with the question of exactly _how_ we lost the travel mask mandate, in the
sense of who made it happen.  Murphy &amp; Savage at the _NYT_ have a good explainer,
which is what we'll mine for today. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

We know pretty much who the major suspects should be, at least behind the scenes as 
_les eminences grises_, funding and orchestrating the effort: Republicans, who oppose
public health measures apparently because "government bad always everywhere", and the
travel industry who prioritize their profits above all else, including traveller safety.  

Is that what happened?  

Well, only kinda.  The details are of course complicated, because nothing is ever allowed
to be simple.  It was a confluence of at least 3 things, possibly more if we dig into
their funding sources:

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-02-no-masks-new-wave-aba-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-02-no-masks-new-wave-aba-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="360" alt="Noel @ ABA: Official letter documenting Mizelle is not qualified to be a federal judge" title="Noel @ ABA: Official letter documenting Mizelle is not qualified to be a federal judge" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Leslie Manookian, a former Wall Street analyst and now conservative political activist
  who founded a non-profit _specifically to fight against COVID-19 public health measures._  
- Two Florida women who claim masks make them too anxious to travel, and thus were useful
  pawns in a lawsuit paid for by somebody else.  
- Federal judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, appointed by Trump in spite of the fact that the
  American Bar Association rated her as _not qualified_ due to lack of 
  experience! <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  She had,
  however, clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas, which burnished her conservative
  credentials enough to get Republican confirmation votes.  (She has some peculiar
  beliefs, like paper money being unconstitutional and that the government can only make
  coins.)  

Notably, Judge Mizelle's decision hinged on a conservative _shibboleth_ that all powers
must be explicitly enumerated in law, i.e., Congress can't delegate much of anything by
saying "and other situations that the CDC deems important."  This requires Congress to
foretell the future, and more or less cripples the government's ability to function at
all.  It pretty much throws out the window the idea that the government can listen to
expert opinion and do anything about it.  

The lawsuit, apparently partially funded by Manookian's organization, chose attorneys
apparently by ideology rather than experience: one was a specialist in drone law, and the
other represented an organization known for spreading disinformation about COVID-19
vaccines.  

They specifically chose the plaintiffs by residency, for a chance to get into Judge
Mizelle's court.  

So everything's carefully crafted to line up the ideologues like dominoes, ready to be
tipped.  

The Justice Department is appealing&hellip; _slowly._  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-02-no-masks-new-wave-scotusblog-1.jpg" width="400" height="178" alt="Millett @ SCOTUSBlog: Munsingwear and vacating decisions about moot matters" title="Millett @ SCOTUSBlog: Munsingwear and vacating decisions about moot matters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Why so slow?  It's kind of cool: there was a dispute about the Munsingwear company
providing clothing to the US government in the 1940s, which made it to the Supreme Court
in 1950.  The issue was no longer relevant, i.e., "moot".  So the Supreme Court not only
reversed the lower court decisions, but _erased_ them: it all became as if those cases had
never happened (United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36 (1950))!  <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>

In this case, if Justice can get the appeals courts to rule _after_ the mask mandate would
have expired (which happens _tomorrow_), then the issue is moot.  Not only can
Mizelle's decision on mask mandates be removed from the record, but also here bizarre
decision neutering the government's ability to write general law.  

Well, that's a hopeful sign, at least.  If by "hopeful" you mean "a chancy way to fend off
the vampires one more time", which is what dealing with right-wing crazies is starting to
feel like.  


## The Next Wave  

So, no masks, at least for a while.  Until the appeal neuters the decision, anyway.  

But could that still be ok?  

I mean, we're doing this for utterly stupid right-wing ideological reasons, but might the
situation actually merit mask removals?  In a word, no: federal judges are not qualified
to have an opinion about this, while the CDC _is qualified._  The CDC still says masks on
public transportation and airplanes are useful.  

Also, consider the coming wave of viral mutations, as explained by Eric Topol of Scripps:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    As the mutations march on, with BA.2.12.1 25% more transmissible than BA.2, which was
	30%+ more transmissible than Omicron BA.1, which was 50% more transmissible than
	Delta, let&#39;s just pretend we&#39;re finished

</blockquote>

Ok, let's run a few numbers:  
- The Delta variant of SARS-CoV2 has $R_0 \sim 6 - 7$.  <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>
  That means each infected person infects 6 or 7 other people, i.e., it's _really
  contagious!_  (Measles has $R_0 \sim 16 - 18$, which is the nastiest one I know.)  
- So the latest Omicron variant (BA.2.12.1) should, according to Topol, have:
  $$
	\begin{align*}
      R_0 &\sim 1.25 \times 1.3 \times 1.5 \times (6 - 7) \\
	      &= 2.4375 \times (6 - 7) \\
		  &= 14.6 - 16.6
	\end{align*}
  $$

Now, it might be a bit na&iuml;ve to multiply offhand multipliers like this times an $R_0$
which can be modified by behavior (masking, social distancing, and vaccination).  But very
roughly speaking, the BA.2.12.1 Omicron variant of SARS-CoV2 looks to be among the very
worst viruses known.  

Emphatically _not_ a time to loosen up public health measures, like masking.  


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-02-no-masks-new-wave-wapo-1.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="Achenbach @ WaPo: New variant shows continued SARS-CoV2 mutations" title="Achenbach @ WaPo: New variant shows continued SARS-CoV2 mutations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
By way of evidence, Topol points us to an explanatory article by Joel Achenbach in the 
_WaPo_. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  He quotes Tulane virologist Robert F. Garry as
saying:  

> "We know it's probably not quite as infectious as measles yet, but it's creeping up
> there, for sure."  

So the crude $R_0$ calculation above might be a crude estimate, but given that measles is around
$R_0 \sim 16 - 18$ and we predicted BA.2.12.1 $R_0 \sim 14 - 16$, it's not _that_ far off.  

The mutation in question appears to be S704L in the spike protein (at amino acid position
704 in the protein, substitute the serine (S) with a leucine (L)).  In theory this makes
the spike protein more flexible, apparently thus less likely to bind to an antibody but
still able to grab onto the ACE3 receptor for infecting a cell.  

## The Weekend Conclusion  

The newer Omicron variants like BA.2.12.1 are going to rip through the population.  The BA.4
and BA.5 variants recently discovered in Africa may be worst than _that._  Whether the
population has enough vaccine immunity through boosting or prior infection to keep out of
serious disease remains to be seen, and is basically a gamble.  

It is not an auspicious time to be removing mask mandates to further right-wing political
vendettas.  

Though, really, there's _no_ good time for right-wing political vendettas.
