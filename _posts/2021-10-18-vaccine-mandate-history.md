The history of why vaccine mandates are in fact constitutional in the United States has a
long, somewhat twisted history.  It's also of local interest, here at Chez Weekend, as
many of the important events transpired a short [MBTA](https://www.mbta.com/) ride away.  


##  Why do we talk so much about mandates?

From _Bloomberg_ last Friday came an article by Jonathan Levin <sup
id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, tracking the long sad decline of life expectancy in America.
What used to be a first-class economy with widespread prosperity has become something of a
Dickensian nightmare of massive inequality, racism, and now a regrettable tendency of
Republicans to embrace fascism.  The latest fit in that nightmare has been a decline in
life expectancy: the American healthcare system is not only a leading cause of bankruptcy,
its spotty availability and our inability to absorb sensible public health advice is
killing us.  

They're using a paper by UCLA professors Heuveline and Tzen, from the 
_BMJ._ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
And it's not just a little blip, it's a large effect!  Consider Figure 4 from Heuveline
&amp; Tzen, reproduced here: it shows a life expectancy drop  _by 2 years_, averaged
across the _entire US population._

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-18-vaccine-mandate-history-bloomberg-2.jpg" width="400" height="293" alt="Bloomberg: Life expectancy cuts specifically in South and Mountain West" title="Bloomberg: Life expectancy cuts specifically in South and Mountain West" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Also, the average over the US population doesn't tell the real story, because it's not 
random: as the map from Bloomberg shows, the decline in life expectancy is
concentrated in the south, parts of the plains, and parts of the mountain west.  These are
the Trumpiest, most Republican parts of the US, where people fanatically resist masks or
vaccination, preferring useless things like ivermectin.  People of my political persuasion
have taken to calling the GOP a "death cult": here's evidence of the
_literal truth_ of that name.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-18-vaccine-mandate-history-ap.jpg" width="400" height="175" alt="AP: Japan's COVID-19 success with masks and vaccines" title="AP: Japan's COVID-19 success with masks and vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
And the thing is, it _didn't have to be this way_, coming up on 3/4 of a million _dead_ in
the US.  Other countries have manged to do much better.  

For example, here at Chez Weekend we have an interest in Japan.  The AP reports that Japan
has had some stellar success fighting COVID-19 <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> (after,
admittedly, a slow start from requiring an additional Japanese clinical trial).  The
mega-city of Tokyo now has _fewer than 100 cases per day:_  
- Wearing masks when one does not feel well is _customary in normal times_ in Japan, so
  wearing a mask in a pandemic didn't even have to be mentioned, let alone mandated.  
- While they had a slow start, they eventually got to a very rapid rate of vaccination:
  they are now at 70% of the population fully vaccinated (vs 57.4% in the US as of today).
  That plus some natural immunity from previous infection might put them over the top for
  herd immunity, depending on what one believes about Delta's $R_0$.  
  
People acted _sensibly_, and they get to live.  That's why we keep talking about mandates:
if we won't act sensibly voluntarily, then the only way to save lives is through
mandates.  


## Are mandates legal?  Can 'they' really do that?

Yes, 'they' can.  And should.  

It's a long-established legal precedent in the US: [Jacobson v
Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts) is the US Supreme
Court decision that decided the matter, bac in 1905.  Yes, it's more than a century old.
No, it's not a dead letter: it grants the ability to fine or imprison vaccine resisters
during a public health crisis, but it also limits police power (no use of physical force
to impose vaccinations).  Apparently lawyers like that sort of thing.  

The story of how it came about is intriguing.  


## Smallpox: Boston, 1901  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-18-vaccine-mandate-history-globe-1.jpg" width="400" height="170" alt="Globe: Vaccine resistance &amp; mandates from smallpox in Boston" title="Globe: Vaccine resistance &amp; mandates from smallpox in Boston" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
From the venerable _Globe_ comes the story of how we got here. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>
It's a surprisingly tangled tale with larger than life characters, some of whom sadly
resemble figures like Fauci who advise common sense to minimize death, and Trump
who&hellip; well, acts inexplicably destructively.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-18-vaccine-mandate-history-durgin.jpg" width="254" height="370" alt="Dr. Samuel Holmes Durgin" title="Dr. Samuel Holmes Durgin" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Meet Dr. Samuel Holmes Durgin: graduate of Harvard Med School, commissioned as a surgeon
in the Civil War, later port surgeon of Boston and chair of the Boston Board of Health
Commissioners.  For his day, he was highly qualified.  (Also, improbably handsome, as all
the characters in this tale seem to be.  No idea what's goin' on there.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-18-vaccine-mandate-history-globe-2.jpg" width="400" height="463" alt="Globe: 1902-Jan-28 vaccination teams of 115 doctors vaccinate 10,000 against smallpox" title="Globe: 1902-Jan-28 vaccination teams of 115 doctors vaccinate 10,000 against smallpox" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
He was on the Board of Health Commissioners in the 1873 smallpox outbreak, and saw first
hand that vaccination saved lives.  In 1901 it came back and he was horrified, and
organized vaccination teams that could vaccinate people by force, if necessary.  This was
severely overdone: in at least one case, the doctor doing the vaccination had to stich up
a head wound from a police officer's club.  

Ok that's&hellip; the dark side.  

Given the use of violent force by police &mdash; regrettable today, but much more common
then &mdash; there was undesrtandable resistance.  It grew out of the reaction to forced
vaccination, but also from the usual superstitions: that vaccines _cause_ smallpox, that
they don't work, that they are somehow making our "blood impure"&hellip; the usual dreck.  

So Durgin proposed a put-up-or-shut-up campaign.  As the _Globe_ says, reporting on itself
more than a century earlier:  

> "If there are among the adult and leading members of the antivaccinationists any who
> would like an opportunity to show the people their sincerity in what they profess," he
> announced in The Boston Globe, "I will make arrangements by which that belief may be
> tested . . . by exposure to smallpox without vaccination."  

He figured nobody would be stupid enough to take him up on it.

That's never a good bet.  


## The Resistance  

Meet Dr. Immaneul Pfeiffer. The _Globe_ quotes the advertisements for his medical
practice:

> &hellip; blessed with a natural healing power and peculiar magnetism, which has made him
> the most wonderful man in the world.  

&hellip; who often claimed to cure the incurable by the laying on of hands, was a fan of
hypnotism, and said his "mental command" over digestion allowed him to go without food for
extraordinary periods.  Basically: a flim-flam artist.  

He published a monthly magazine called _Our Home Rights_ about all sorts of bizarre
subjects like astrology and tax protests.  He _hated_ vaccines, for reasons as inscrutable
as everything else he thought.  Attempting to apply reason to him is a category error.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-18-vaccine-mandate-history-gallops-island.jpg" width="400" height="206" alt="Gallop's Island in Boston Harbor" title="Gallop's Island in Boston Harbor" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Pfeiffer took Durgin's bet, and they went off to the quarantine unit on 
[Gallop's Island in the Boston harbor](https://www.bostonharborislands.org/gallops-island/).
Ironically, today you can tie up your boat there but you can't get off to explore the
island, due to asbestos contamination of more or less everything.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-18-vaccine-mandate-history-globe-4.jpg" width="400" height="231" alt="Globe: editorial cartooon on Pfeiffer's smallpox" title="Globe: editorial cartooon on Pfeiffer's smallpox" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-18-vaccine-mandate-history-globe-3.jpg" width="239" height="650" alt="Globe: Pfeiffer gets smallpox, flees to Bedford" title="Globe: Pfeiffer gets smallpox, flees to Bedford" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Pfeiffer toured the place, touched the patients, even deliberately inhaled the breath of
one of the sickest.  Afterward he took a train to a meeting where he waved in his friends'
faces his handkerchief that he had used on the island.  Then he described to them how
clever he was, to make Durgin fall into his "trap".  

What happened next was, of course, entirely predictable: of course the fool caught
smallpox, and apparently a bad case.  What he did next was almost as bad: under cover of
night, he evaded quarantine, going to his farm in Bedford.  The people of Bedford were not
best pleased at being so exposed and imposed guards around the farm.  The _Globe_ reported
it as shown here.  Pfeiffer also seems quite handsome; what _is_ it with this story and
handsome men behaving badly?!  

Durgin pressed the advantage of Pfeiffer's horribly bad example: 130 doctors vaccinated
12,000 more Bostonians in the tightly packed housing of the North End and West End.
Reports from the time say nobody much objected, Pfeiffer's foolishness being in the front
of everyone's minds.  

So&helliip; success?  

Not really: Pfeiffer managed to survive, and _continued to say vaccination was worthless_,
and minimized the effects of smallpox saying it wasn't worth avoiding!  


## Longer term consequences  

Misinformation matters.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-18-vaccine-mandate-henning-jacobson.jpg" width="168" height="224" alt="Wikipedia: Henning Jacobson" title="Wikipedia: Henning Jacobson" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Meet Henning Jacobson, the handsome fellow shown here, who is about to misbehave in his
own fashion.  

Across the river in Cambridge, police tried to vaccinate Jacobson, who refused and
was fined \$5 (a good chunk in those days, maybe \$150 today).  At least they weren't
beating people down and vaccinating by force any more, possibly because Jacobson was a
pastor.  

One thing led to another, lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit&hellp; and it ended up before the US
Supreme Court.  In a 7-2 decsion, 
[Jacobson v Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobson_v._Massachusetts)
established that:  
- In times of public health crisis, government can indeed compell vaccination.  
- However, they cannot use force, only fines and imprisonment.  So no more cops beating
  people senseless so their pet cop doc and vax the victim.  
  
It both supports state powers and limits them, so lawyers like it.  The decision has been
affirmed numerous times, and is still in active use.  There's a nice review by Wendy
Mariner and co-authors in _Am J Public Health_ that is worth your time.

It is, as the saying goes, _stare decisis_.  

Nobody likes a mandate, but they stop people dying.  

And people do like not dying.
