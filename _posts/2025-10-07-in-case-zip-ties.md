Just in case your hands are zip-tied for some reason&hellip; probably don't wear loafers.  


## Some Advice From A Little Girl

There are a variety of videos of this sort on YouTube.  This one is from an account called
["FurFamily"](https://www.youtube.com/@furfamily/shorts), which seems to consist mostly of
cute animal videos.  (However, I note that I couldn't find this video directly linked in
their pages, so it may be in the process of being suppressed?  Hence it's archived here,
for posterity.)  

She's making a very useful point about the physics of zip ties: they mightily resist
tension, but are relatively lame about friction _across_ the tie.  

Therefore, using her shoelaces, she can apply enough friction to heat the plastic and rip
through it quite quickly.  

__But don't forget:__ At the end of this physics experiment, her shoelaces were tied
together &ndash; a configuration mostly good for lying down, not for walking.  Or running.
So, if you try to replicate this physics experiment and are for some reason in a hurry,
remember to retie shoes in a more conventional manner!  

I guess if you _insist_ on wearing loafers in fascist-infested areas, you should probably
have a "decorative" loop of string around your wrist?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Sound advice, in case of kidnapping by fascists (or even garden-variety kidnappers).  

I'm way too old to be put in a position to do this personally, but it seems like a
regrettably useful thing to know.

Nope.
