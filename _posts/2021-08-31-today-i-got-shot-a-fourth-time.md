Today I got shot for the fourth time this year.  No, not the COVID-19 booster (yet).  The
second dose of Shingrix, for shingles.  


## Shingles is nothing to mess around with  

[Shingles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shingles) is what happens when the 
[chickenpox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chickenpox) disease of childhood leaves behind
some terrorist cells of 
[varicella zoster virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_zoster_virus).  They hang
out in your body, doing not much of anything, until you get old.  Then they break out and
_directly attack pain nerves_ in what's called
[postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postherpetic_neuralgia)&hellip;
which is way less fun than it sounds, even if you're a masochist.  

Fortunately, since 1995, there's been a chickenpox vaccine to stop this in childhood;
every kid should get that.  But as a grumpy _old_ scientist, I didn't have the benefit of
that vaccine in my childhood, which places me at risk for shingles _now_.  The
epidemiology says that 95% of adults in the US have had chicken 
pox. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

So&hellip;shingles vaccine it is, then!

Yeah, we got 'em.  

Some time ago, I got the then-current shingles vaccine, Zostavax.  It had an efficacy of
50% &ndash; 60% <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, which at the time seemed pretty good.
But then Shingrix came along, with a stunning efficacy of 
about 97%! <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  (Even _better_ than the mRNA COVID-19
vaccines.)  

So, yeah&hellip; I want me some of that.  More to the point, my doctor agrees and is
revaccinating all her patients who already got Zostavax.  

Shingrix is a 2-shot series, and yesterday after forking over $25 and flashing my Medicare
ID card, I got my 2nd shot.  (Third shot, if you want to include the earlier Zostavax.)  


## Side effects  

About what you'd expect: sore upper left arm, 1.5&deg;C fever (axillary measurement), lots
of fatigue and achy joints &amp; muscles.  (Though, to be fair, the last bit is more or
less normal for me, as age creeps upon me.)  Mildly annoying, but not nearly so annoying
as shingles!  That's a _good_ trade-off.  

Looking forward to spending a day on the couch, watching the 
[JJ Abrams _Star Trek_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(film)), a documentary on
Leonard Nimoy called [_For the Love of Spock_](https://www.netflix.com/title/80115102),
and maybe even binge-watch the [_Twilight_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(novel_series))
movies (hey, don't judge me; the Weekend Editrix hates them, but although I have some
reservations, I like the adventure &amp; love story parts).  

This is the 4th vaccine this year for both your humble Weekend Editor &amp; Editrix (2
COVID-19 + 2 Shingrix).  I'm forecasting a total of 6 jabs this year for us (additionally:
COVID-19 booster + flu shot), which means 2021 will be a banner year for vaccinations,
here at Chez Weekend.  

Looking forward to feeling a bit better tomorrow.  Looking even more forward to 
_not getting shingles_ for the rest of my life.
