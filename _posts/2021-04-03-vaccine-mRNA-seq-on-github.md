Interestingly, some Stanford scientists saved a few drops of the Moderna vaccine, apparently ran
them through their sequencers, and posted the sequences on GitHub.  


## Who did what now?

_Vice_ reports <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> that Andrew Fire and Massa Shoura of
Stanford saved a few drops of Moderna vaccine from a vial destined for the trash, and
apparently sequenced it.  While the article uses rash terms like "reverse engineered",
Fire &amp; Shoura are careful to point out that is not the case:

> "We didn't reverse engineer the vaccine. We posted the putative sequence of two
> synthetic RNA molecules that have become sufficiently prevalent in the general
> environment of medicine and human biology in 2021," they told Motherboard in an
> email. "As the vaccine has been rolling out, these sequences have begun to show up in
> many different investigational and diagnostic studies. Knowing these sequences and
> having the ability to differentiate them from other RNAs in analyzing future biomedical
> data sets is of great utility."  
>&hellip;  
>"For this work, RNAs were obtained as discards from the small portions of vaccine doses
>that remained in vials after immunization; such portions would have been required to be
>otherwise discarded and were analyzed under FDA authorization for research use," they
>said.  

They deposited their results <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> on [GitHub](https://github.com/), 
a well-known site for project management of open-source software (and the host of this
crappy little blog, just so we have full disclosure here).  


## What should we think about that?  

This isn't the same as posting the well-known sequence for the mRNA of SARS-CoV-2, since
the vaccine mRNA has several mutations, a poly-A tail, and other features designed to
stabilize it when it's not attached to the rest of a virus particle.  

These specific changes are probably regarded as proprietary by Moderna (and similar ones
for Pfizer), so I'm not quite sure how to feel about this.  In general I _detest_ the idea
of RNA/DNA/gene/protein patents (and don't even get me started on software patents or
business process patents!).  But on the other hand, I acknowledge there was signficant
work involved in modifying the wild-type viral RNA for the vaccine and that is probably
reasonable intellectual property.

Yet it's _not_ equivalent to a vaccine.  There are thousands of other things involved,
like the lipid nanocapsule, buffers, solvents, and so on.  And that's not even mentioning
the manufacturing know-how.  The mRNA sequence is, while scientifically interesting, only
the tiniest step of commercializing a vaccine.  

So I'm leaning toward thinking this is ok, maybe even a public service.  

What do you think?
