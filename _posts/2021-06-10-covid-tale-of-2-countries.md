As COVID-19 _gradually_ comes under control in the US, we are becoming 2 countries: one
that listends to science and medical advice, and another rather more backward.  This leads
to some startlingly disturbing contrasts in the news.  


## What's the Sitch?  

In some ways, the US is on track (though not the rest of the world).  Full vaccination
rates are now around 50%, in some areas _much_ higher.  The economy hums along with
pent-up demand, despite periodic materials shortages.  Things are starting to re-open.
Earlier this week, the Weekend Editrix &amp; I _ate out at a restaurant_ for the first
time in 15 months!  

But&hellip; that's by no means uniform.  Some parts of the US &ndash; mostly the red
states, if you can't guess &ndash; actively, angrily _resist_ vaccination and public
health measures in favor of hoodoo or proto-fascist pronouncements from their
regrettably authoritarian politicians.  

That's the sitch.  And I don't like it.  


## The Dark Side  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-06-10-covid-tale-of-2-countries-umair.jpg" width="400" height="251" alt="Umair Haque/Eudaimonia: The New Dark Age and the Death of Freedom" title="Umair Haque/Eudaimonia: The New Dark Age and the Death of Freedom" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
[Umair Haque, internet-famous vampire](https://umairhaque.com/my-story-db079024396b)
(probably
[porphyria](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20161031-the-real-life-disease-that-spread-the-vampire-myth)?)
is always interesting, and not just about the vampire thing.  His essays get right to the
heart of current events.  They are usually quite dark, though these are dark times, so
that fits.  He recently wrote an essay comparing our gradually eroding democracies around
the world to the start of a new Dark Age. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  It's
fascinating as always, but what caught my eye here was his cover photo reproduced here.  

It shows Texans &ndash; one of the states more floridly expressing anti-science lunacy
&ndash; carrying a sign comparing the COVID-19 vaccines to 
[the Mark of the Beast in the Bible's Book of Revelations 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_beast#Mark_of_the_beast).  

Now, it almost doesn't matter the number of ways in which this is wrong: that original was coded
language ("_ἀποκάλυψις_" (apokálypsis) = "out from under cover" in Greek) for the
persecution under Roman Emperor Nero, that such literature of the times was seldom
intended as future prophecy (but rather as coded critique of the then-powerful), or that
it's just plain wildly irrational.  Look at the people in the picture: only 2 are masked,
no social distancing (and indeed one loon holding a sign saying "Social Distancing STOPS
Herd Immunity"!), and so on.  In particular, look at the woman in the hat at the left end
of the banner: leaning forward, face grimacing, mouth wide open &ndash; actually
_bellowing_ out her angry ignorance.  

This is one reason effective public health measures are hard.  People stupidly, stubbornly
_resist_.  Now they're claiming vaccines turn you into a magnet so you can be reprogrammed
by 5G signals.  Or that the nasal swab in a COVID-19 test "bruises your amygdala"
(breaking into your skull?) to make you more submissive to authority.  Or&hellip; look, I
just can't go on.  It literally sickens me.  

This, alas, leads to declining vaccination rates.  In the US, we've vaccinated most of the
people who are willing.  There's still some work to do, getting the vaccine out to the
poor, those who get no time off work, those who just need a little friendly persuasion
from community figures they trust.  We're doing that.  But there's a cadre of hard-core
louts who just _won't_ take care of themselves, nor give a care for the welfare of
everyone _else_ who'd rather not breed new viral variants:

And, of course, that's not uniformly distributed.  It's concentrated in the American
South, land of Christian fundamentalism, hard-core Republicans, and low education.  I am
_so_ tired of being told I have to cut them a break!  But the evidence is that they prefer
their local superstitions and _want_ COVID-19 not to stop:

    Lots of factors involved in South’s vax lag — GOP resistance, black suspicion of medical system, rural isolation, poor access to health care.

It's gotten very, very bad.  The usual go-to example of psychotic delusion in Congress is
[Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene), who is a
Q-Anon nut.  But even more disheartening is the example of 
[Louis Gohmert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Gohmert), who has represented Texas
for over 15 years.  He has such a reputation for stupidity that people wanting to criticize
someone _else's_ knuckleheadery describe them as "the dumbest person in Congress not
named Louie Gohmert", so as to exclude the outlier.  Case in point: here is a _Reuters_
video in which he asks the US Forest Service if they could _change the orbit of the moon_
in order to stabilize the earth against climate change!  

Where do you even _begin_ to deal with that?  


## The Good Side  

Ick.  We need a palate cleanser.  Is there any good news?  

Why, yes.  Yes, there is.  

Recall that if $R_0$ is the average number of new people infected by one COVID-19 patient, then
[the mathematical basis for herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity#Theoretical_basis)
tells us that the probability a random person is immunized must be:  

$$
p \ge 1 - \frac{1}{R_0}
$$

Of course, $R_0$ depends on the disease organism, as well as human behavior (mask usage,
social distancing, and all the other preventive measures people somehow want to resist).
Still, [even somewhat pessimistic estimates]({{ site.baseurl }}/republicans-vs-herd-immunity/#the-critical-question) 
put COVID-19 $R_0 \sim 2.5 - 4.0$.  That means herd immunity can be achieved around 75%
vaccination rates, as probably a high estimate of what's required.  

So the news that Seattle, at least, has achieved something near that is definitely good
news.  We should all hope to follow them, and _fast_:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Seattle has become the first major U.S. city to hit the COVID-19 milestone of getting 70% of people aged 12 and up fully vaccinated, according to Mayor Jenny Durkan. She says the city and its partners will now start efforts to support Seattle’s reopening. <a href="https://t.co/Ot4aT1yadg">https://t.co/Ot4aT1yadg</a>

Some of the rather more rational people in the US are beginning to realize what this
means.  For example, [Zvi Mowshowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Mowshowitz) has
some interesting advice for us about making persistent thought patterns "pay rent", i.e.,
help us adapt to the world in some useful way:  

> You may not have had Covid-19, but the virus has still been living rent free in your head for over a year. Kick it out. &mdash; Zvi Mowshowitz, [_The Zvi_](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2021/06/10/covid-6-10-somebody-elses-problem/), 2021-Jun-10.  

Yeah, I like the thought of not being on high alert about COVID-19 any more.  But _only_
in situations where we're mostly vaccinated!  I won't be making any trips to the rather
more dangerous American South any time soon.  

In the meantime, perhaps we should adapt our attitudes and at least _attempt_ grace:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    An observation: Right now is not easy, no matter who you are. The last 16 months were tough. And the sadness, anger, &amp; fatigue are finally oozing to the surface.<br><br>

    So please, let’s default to having grace for each other.<br><br>

    We sure could all use it.

It's of course in our interest to have the entire world vaccinated, since as
epidemiologists say: "None of us are safe until all of us are safe."  But sometimes, we
can just decide to be generous:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

    of Pfizer&#39;s coronavirus vaccine to donate to countries that cannot afford to buy

## The Weekend Conclusion  

So&hellip; yeah.  Conflicting news.  

Some parts of the country have taking masking, social distancing, and vaccination
seriously.  They're nearing normalcy and probably have a bright future.  

Other parts are denying science and public health advice, calling masks "muzzles", saying
the vaccine is the Mark of the Beast or that it turns you into a magnet for 5G
reprogramming.  Their COVID-19 rates account for most of the deaths in the US.  They have
a future which to some degree resembles the Dark Ages: fascist and superstitious.  

These times are, to quote [Dickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens) in 
[_A Tale of Two Cities_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tale_of_Two_Cities):  

> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was
> the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it
> was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
> was the winter of despair.

I wish I knew how to make it better.  But maybe we don't _want_ better.
