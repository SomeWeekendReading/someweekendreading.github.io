Apparently Moderna just had an earnings call, and there was some talk of whether
multivalent Omicron boosters could be available in time for fall/winter 2022/2023.  


## What's the Sitch?  

As is apparently &ndash; and sadly &ndash; the now-ubiquitous custom, I first stumbled
across the news because [somebody rubbed my nose in a tweet]({{ site.baseurl }}/#SomebodyAskedMe):  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Desired features of northern hemisphere fall/winter ‘22-23 booster, per Moderna:<br>
    -improve durability of protective neutralizing antibodies vs omicron to 6+ mos<br>
    -retain high, durable protection vs delta &amp; ancestral strains<br>
    -broaden cross-protective immunity

(Nothing against Meg Tirrell, who seems to be a fine reporter.  It's just Twitter that I
want to avoid like the plague.  As if people actually avoided plagues anymore, a tradition
now somewhat in question.)  

__NB__ the content in 2 parts:  
1. A general description of what Moderna folk think is required to have meaningful variant
   vaccines available by fall, and   
2. A statement that if the FDA decides to pick some other strain or combination at the end
   of June, then there won't be enough time to manufacture 10's of millions of doses by
   fall/winter.  
   
Both interesting statements.  

First, let's consider the FDA situation.  I wasn't aware that they had chosen a mix for
multivalent variant vaccines.  In fact, I wasn't aware they had chosen a _procedure_ by
which to make the choice!  I mean,
[we wrote about the 2022-Apr-06 VRBPAC meeting]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-vrbpac-booster-policy/)
where this was debated, but I didn't get the impression anyone had said this is "How It
Shall Be Done."  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fda-calendar.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fda-calendar-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="178" alt="FDA Advisory Committee calendar, 2022-Mar-10 through 2022-Jul-12, as of 2022-May-10" title="FDA Advisory Committee calendar, 2022-Mar-10 through 2022-Jul-12, as of 2022-May-10" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Just to be sure, I checked the FDA's advisory committee calendar, shown here (click to
embiggen). <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  Sure enough, I didn't miss anything: no
further official decisions, unless said decisions were taken _in camera_ and not yet publicized to
randoms like me.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hmpf.png" width="400" height="160" alt="Hmpf." title="Hmpf." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So&hellip; Moderna might have a point here: if the FDA doesn't decide (a) the criteria and
(b) the specific results of which strains go into a mixture, it will be hard to
manufacture in time for winter.  Furthermore, Moderna is running a trial right now on a
bivalent vaccine (_q.v._).  If the FDA says something else, then all that effort will be
wasted (except to prove safety&hellip; _again_).  

Hmpf.  We better look into that.  


## The Moderna Earnings Call Slides  

Way back
[in 2022-Sep-02 we blogged about a Moderna earnings call]({{ site.baseurl }}/moderna-q2-earnings-call/).
Let's try that again, for the latest earnings call.  

So I got hold of a copy of the Moderna slides for their 2022-Q1 earnings call, and
memorialized them here on this crummy little blog that nobody reads
(CLBTNR). <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  Let's have a quick look through them.  

### Financial Position  

First, let's look at the financial position, without getting into the <strike>BATGUANO</strike>
[BATGAAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generally_Accepted_Accounting_Principles_(United_States))
details.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fin-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fin-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Moderna Earnings Call: Financial highlights" title="Moderna Earnings Call: Financial highlights" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
It appears Moderna is in an enviable position: \$6.1 billion in revenue (presumably nearly
all from Spikevax, given that it's their only commercial product), and keeping about 60%
of that as net income.  

Also, they have an eye-popping reserve of \$19.3 billion in cash.  

That's the current picture; the future looks pretty good too since they have a book of
business of \$21 billion in signed purchase agreements, again presumably for Spikevax.  

So the current situation and the near-term future look pretty good.  Given that they're
one of 2 vendors (with Pfizer) of a life-saving vaccine that every living human wants, it
would be hard to see how to screw up so badly to make it otherwise!  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fin-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fin-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="Moderna Earnings Call: Spikevax market share" title="Moderna Earnings Call: Spikevax market share" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Where's the money coming from?  Well, with only 1 product, it's gotta be that product.  

But they're disclosing something else of interest here: their market share over the last
year has been growing in almost all markets, as shown here.  Both Moderna's Spikevax and Pfizer's
Comirnaty are excellent vaccines, but Spikevax appears to be displacing either Pfizer,
J&amp;J, or AstraZeneca vaccines in many countries.  I'm kind of curious why&hellip;  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fin-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fin-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Moderna Earnings Call: Shift of earnings from US to rest of world" title="Moderna Earnings Call: Shift of earnings from US to rest of world" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Also, we might ask where in the world the money's coming from.  It appears that at the
beginning of 2021-Q1, most of the revenue was from the US (dark blue, 77.8% of sales).  But just 1
year later, almost all the revenue was from the rest of the world and the US decreased
remarkably (dark blue down to 15.3% of sales).  So it sounds like initial Spikevax sales went to
the US, and now they're selling into the rest of the world.  

I have mixed feelings about that, but it's what seems to be the truth.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fin-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-fin-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Moderna Earnings Call: Capital allocation priorities" title="Moderna Earnings Call: Capital allocation priorities" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Lastly, we should ask what they're _doing_ with the money.  

As shown here, their (claimed) capital allocation priorities are:  
1. __Reinvest in R&amp;D and capital equipment.__  This is nontrivial: they're putting \$2.5 -
   3.0 _billion_ into R&amp;D alone, which is a major undertaking.  
2. __Look for mergers &amp; acquisitions.__  I'm always a little impatient with this, since it
   seems to be the MBA's way to make research progress, by letting somebody else do the
   work and they buying them.  Still&hellip; it works sometimes.  
3. __Share buybacks to "return capital to shareholders."__  Well, actually, it returns capital
   to _former_ shareholders, since they sell back their shares.  I guess this is what all
   the cool kids do now instead of dividends.  (Shrug; I'm a
   [total return investor](https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/total-return-investing-a-superior-approach-for-income-investors),
   anyway.)  
   
None of that is grossly unreasonable or nonsensical.  


### State of the Pipeline

In this sort of pharma/finance [kabuki theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki),
it's more or less traditional to make wild claims of near-term product launches resulting
from clinical trials whose success is assumed.  These claims are defensible, but rarely realized.  

True to the form of these dramas, Moderna is claiming their current Phase 3 trials "could
lead to" 3 respiratory drug approvals in the next 2-3 years.  That would be a subset of:
- a bivalent Omicron-specific COVID-19 vaccine/booster (near-term, for Q3 2022)  
- An mRNA flu vaccine, trials starting 2022-Q2 (i.e., approximately now)  
- An mRNA RSV ([respiratory syncytial virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus))
  vaccine (frequently causes infant hospitalization, though it's a nuisance in adults, who
  can then give it to infants),  
- An mRNA CMV ([cytomegalovirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytomegalovirus)) vaccine
  (mononucleosis and pneumonia in humans)  
  
There are others in their pipeline, but given their success with vaccines, these have some
reasonable air of plausibility about them.  

The first slide shown here is an overview of their pipeline from high altitude (and 3 more
slides with the details):  
- Earlier stage projects are on the right; they progress toward approvals/commercial
  status on the left.  
- The latest-stage projects are all mRNA vaccines.  The earlier stage projects have some
  very exciting mRNA therapeutics for oncology, rare diseases, cardiovascular, and
  autoimmune.  These are _really_ interesting scientifically!  My colleagues and I were
  working on similar things at the time I retired a couple years ago, so it's nice to see
  Moderna has continued moving those ideas forward.  
- The most interesting one to me is the HIV vaccine, center of the chart, currently in
  Phase 1.  We wrote about this
  [before]({{ site.baseurl }}/two-predictions/#revolutionizing-vaccines-of-the-future),
  especially as a reason for
  [hope for the future]({{ site.baseurl }}/pessimism-and-optimism/#reason-2-mrna-hiv-vaccine-trials).  


### Multivalent Variant-Specific Updates to the COVID-19 Vaccine  

Finally, some words about their COVID-19 vaccine, boosters and future variant-tailored
versions of the vaccine.  

They have a lot to say about how boosters work; despite their financial interest in saying
that, I have to agree that the scientific data says the same thing.  So&hellip; yeah, get
boosted.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-covid-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-covid-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="Moderna Earnings Call: COVID-19 boosters in the endemic phase" title="Moderna Earnings Call: COVID-19 boosters in the endemic phase" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
They're also looking ahead hopefully, to the time when COVID-19 is endemic, rather than
pandemic.  To their credit, they've done some thinking about just what the desireable
properties of variant-specific boosters should be.  (While I'd _prefer_ the FDA's VRBPAC
committee to have done this, they were busy being slow or working on other things.)  

So, as shown here, what Moderna designed their multivalent boosters to do was fight the
problems of declining neutralizing titers of antibodies and have some broader spectrum of
activity against new variants.  That includes SARS-CoV2 'classic', as well as the more
deadly Delta variant, the more contagious Omicron variant, and whatever else comes up in
the next year.  (Needless today, but I'm gonna say it: if we'd vaccinate the
_entire world faster_, we could stop having to deal with variants like this.  Political
problem, not a scientific one.)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-covid-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-covid-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Moderna Earnings Call: Bivalent COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials" title="Moderna Earnings Call: Bivalent COVID-19 vaccines in clinical trials" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
In service to that goal, they've been testing several bivalent vaccines, each of which has
the ancestral SARS-CoV2 strain along with another variant.  There are 3 of them, but 2
appear to be "fossil" vaccines: they were started back when Beta and Delta were the
important strains, irrelevant now that Omicron has bigfoot-stomped them almost out of
existence.  (The moral to that seems to be: Moderna can make a vaccine candidate quickly,
but the virus mutates faster than it can get through a clinical trial, let alone FDA
approval?)  

So there is a lot of readout data in the slides on the fossil vaccine candidates, but the
more relevant Omicron version only gets its 1-month readout next month (2022-June).  That
one is mRNA-1273.214, in case you follow the id numbers, or want to Google something.  In
any case, summarizing: the readout data from the fossil vaccine candidates looks about
like what you'd expect: no more than usual side-effects, good efficacy, some specificity
for the 2 variants targeted.  There's no reason to expect that mRNA-1273.214, the one we
want, might be different.  

But of course the data will tell the tale.  And then the FDA has to approve it.  And then
it has to be manufactured, at scale, to be available by fall.  

So now we understand what Meg Tirrell was talking about at the beginning of this post: if
the FDA doesn't accept that ancestral + Omicron is the right set of strains, we have to
start from scratch and won't have time to manufacture/deliver/administer for this winter.  

No pressure, though.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-flu-combo.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-12-moderna-q1-earnings-call-flu-combo-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="Moderna Earnings Call: Flu vaccine and combinations with COVID-19 &amp; RSV" title="Moderna Earnings Call: Flu vaccine and combinations with COVID-19 &amp; RSV" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Also, in a pleasing burst of common sense, Moderna is looking into (a) an mRNA flu shot
that could be quickly reprogrammed, giving health authorities more time to guess which
strains will be relevant each year, and (b) a combination flu shot with COVID-19 booster,
and even one with RSV as long as they're looking at it.  

This seems like a small thing, but it really could be game-changing.  
1. There's only 1 shot to get each fall.  People _hate_ getting vaccinated for reasons
   which still surprise me, so that matters.  
2. Each year, it's a gamble to guess which flu strains will hit the northern hemisphere.
   (Same for the southern, I just happen not to have experience with that.)  So the more
   time we allow epidemiologists and the CDC to assess the circulating strains that will
   hit us, the more accurate the flu vaccine can be.  If the mRNA vaccines can be adjusted
   last-minute before manufacture, that's a win.
   ([The flu vaccine I took last fall]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot-a-fifth-time/#everybody-includes-me)
   was quadrivalent, i.e., hit 4 strains of influenza.)  
3. RSV is usually not a big deal in adults, but hospitalizes infants.  The reason to
   vaccinate adults is that they they can't infect the infants.  This would save some
   number of lives of infants each year, if we could get such a multivalent vaccine
   accepted.  "Accepted" is apparently an even tougher hill to climb than "FDA approved", 
   about which I have sighed a great deal in the last 2 years.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Moderna is "all growed up now", no longer that cute little biotech.  They now have a
market capitalization of \$52.63 billion, which is 10x their market cap as of 2018.  

(For comparison: Pfizer is at \$279.51 billion, i.e., 5.3x larger.)  

On the one hand, numbers like that make one want to think "if only I had invested in
them".  On the other hand, as an index investor who believes in efficient markets, I
recognize that as wishful thinking about things nobody could have known.  And since
Moderna is in the S&amp;P500, they're in the
[world stock index fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT) I use.
(Granted, it's a _tiny_ slice of the world economy.  I probably own 1 screw in 1 doorknob
on 1 of Moderna's facilities.  But yeah&hellip; yeah: that screw?  
Mine. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>)  

While it looks like they're making a ton of money, keep in mind this is for vaccinating
the entire world.  If they could charge market-clearing prices, let alone the huge markup
they probably want, it would be much more.  The \$20 billion in cash they've got now is
the fruit of _restrained_ pricing, largely enforced by governments.  I'm sure their
get-rich plan is to win with the vaccines, establish a rep, and then make bank on the rest
of their pipeline.  At least, that's what I would do, though nobody listens to me.  

I'm particularly interested in their multivalent Omicron vaccines and combo flu
vaccine/COVID/RSV booster for endemic phase.  The rest is exciting, but as a drug
discovery vet I know better than to get too excited.  Sure, they're pursuing KRAS for
intractable cancers (e.g., pancreatic adenocarcinoma), but so was my last employer for a
decade or more.  Some of those targets are _hard!_

Timelines: the June readout of the mRNA-1273.214 multivalent Omicron vaccine trial means
the FDA really can't change strains and expect delivery of vaccines for fall; even flu has
more time than that!  So Tirrell's tweet actually made sense; I guess sometimes that
happens on Twitter.
