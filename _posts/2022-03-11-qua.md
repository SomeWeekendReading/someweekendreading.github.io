XKCD _qua_ XKCD is just XKCD.  Latin _does things_ to your mind.  

## Qua  

_Qua_ is perfectly [cromulent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_the_Iconoclast#Embiggen_and_cromulent) Latin, originally meaning something like "which", declined from the word for "who" (_qui/quae/quod_).  

In not-quite-so-modern English, it's another matter.  
- When you say "X _qua_ Y", you mean "X in its role as Y".  For example: "budget _qua_
  politics" is speaking of a government budget as a poltical instrument.  
- When you say "X _qua_ X", it's a fussy, sorta-academic way of saying "X in its own
  capacity as X, not as a symbol or instrumentality of anything else, just X itself."  So
  you could say you're discussing the "budget _qua_ budget", meaning just the budget as a
  way of allocating resources, not as a statement about power, or politics, or a
  sociological statement about the general level of wealth and poverty&hellip; _just_ as a budget.

Until yesterday's XKCD \#2591. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>

- Cueball is basically saying, "You rarely hear people say 'qua' just to mean intself", but
  doing so in the most convoluted, self-referential, recursive way you can think.  
- Except then, his conversational partner goes one level further!  He said "qua qua qua",
  usually a reference to Lucky's speech in _En Attendant Godot_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
  but she noted that he used it to mean itself.  So, if we add some parentheses to guide
  your parse, she's noting that he said "(qua qua qua) _qua_ (qua qua qua)"!
  (Though, in fact, Lucky in _En Attendant Godot_ is using "qua" as a nonsense
  word, so he is actually using "qua" _qua_ "qua"!)  
- Except _then_, the mouseover text (visible here, also) is even better.  Inserting some
  parentheses to make it easier to parse:  

  > (Qua qua qua) is the (sine qua non) of ((sine qua non) qua (sine qua non)).  

  (Say it out loud.  It's got rhythm.  If there were semioticists who rapped in Latin,
  they would say this.  Or maybe the jump-rope chant of a very strange school where I
  would be perfectly at home.)  

  _Sine qua non_ is a Latin tag &ndash; "without which nothing" &ndash; used in English to
  denote something essential; if you take it away the very nature of the rest is
  drastically different.  For example, intelligent deduction is the _sine qua non_ of
  Sherlock Holmes.  If you take away this ability, he no longer looks like your mental
  image of Sherlock Holmes; he's just a guy in a funny hat smoking an absurd-looking
  pipe.  

  So this sentence is&hellip; as revoltingly &amp; self-referentially recursive as you think it might be.  Probably a [Y (fixpoint) combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator) in there somewhere.  
  
At least they didn't use "per se" _per se_.
