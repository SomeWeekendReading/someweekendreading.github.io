Today the Weekend Editrix got shot, also for the sixth time this year!  It was pretty
good.  


## Choosing a booster  

(Did you know that during my mis-spent childhood, "boosted" was slang for "stolen"?
Language is _weird_.)  

We're pretty vax-positive, here at Chez Weekend.  But&hellip; 6 shots each in 1 year?
That's pretty weird: 2 Pfizer for COVID-19 + 2 Shingrix for shingles + 1 Seqirus Fluad for
influenza&hellip; and now a COVID-19 booster.  I guess this is what happens when one
reaches a certain mature age in a time of pandemic.  

Given that heterologous boosters are now approved, she has a few more options for boosting
than I had.  So we looked over the data on booster effects presented at the FDA hearing on
mix-n-match boosters <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> to figure out what to do.  The goods
are on slide 22 (page 23, if you include the header page the FDA tacked on):  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-15-fda-covid-boosters-jnj-mixmatch-nih-2.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="NIH: Lyke &amp; Atmar, Pseudovirus neutralization for all 9 possible primer/booster combinations" title="NIH: Lyke &amp; Atmar, Pseudovirus neutralization for all 9 possible primer/booster combinations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Here Kirsten Lyke, Robert Atmar, and colleagues at NIH/NIAID did a small trial with all
possible combinations of primer vaccines and booster vaccines, in all orders.  Since there
are 3 vaccines available in the US (Pfizer, Moderna, and J&amp;J) that means the results
are a 3x3 matrix of the 9 combinations as shown here.  The levels are pseudovirus
neutralization antibody titers for the D614G variant:  
- The primer vaccine is shown on the columns.  Since the Weekend Editrix, like your humble
  Weekend Editor, got the Pfizer vaccine, it's the 3rd column that's relevant.  
- The booster vaccine is shown on the rows.  
- The blue number shows the neutralizing antibody titer (bigger is better here).  
- The red number shows the geometric mean fold ratio (basically how many times larger the
  antibody count is two weeks after boosting; bigger is also better here).  

So her choices for a booster to follow Pfizer have these results:  

| __Booster__ | | __GMT__  | | __GM Fold__ |
|:-----------:|-|---------:|-|------------:|
| _Moderna_    | | 3247     | | 32.0x       |
| _J&amp;J_    | |  894     | | 12.5x       |
| _Pfizer_     | | 1846     | | 20.0x       |

So based on both antibody level and fold induction, it looks like Moderna is her best bet
for getting the strongest immunity.  She agreed.  Since she hates fiddling with all the
computer barriers thrown up around getting vax appointments, I found an appointment for
her to get Moderna about a week later.  


## Getting the booster  

"About a week later" is today!  

We boarded the Weekend Zeppelin and set sail for the pharmacy, a short ride away.  It was
early evening, because we'd timed the booster appointment (a) to work around the Weekend
Editrix's work meetings, and (b) to time the side-effects to happen mostly while she's
asleep.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-27-weekend-editrix-shot-sixth-time-stick-pic.jpg" width="400" height="387" alt="The Weekend Editrix gets boosted" title="The Weekend Editrix gets boosted" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Herewith the now regrettably-canonical stick pic.  While it may be regrettable that we
have to get so many vaccinations, it's more regrettable that so many others will _not_ do
so, and are thereby both prolonging the pandemic and breeding new variants.  

After that, we adjourned to her favorite restaurant for dinner and then boarded the
Weekend Zeppelin for the short sail homeward to Ch&acirc;teau Weekend.  

Look: it's easy to get vaccinated, so easy that even a couple of weird folks like us can
do it.  You can do it too.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

All boosted here; 2 weeks from now we will both be as immune as science can make us so
far.  If another booster is required next year, we'll happily take that, too.  Though,
truth be told, we'd _prefer_ it if all the vaccine resisters got vaccinated so we could
wind down the pandemic (mabye replace it with endemic conditions, but _wound down_).  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-27-weekend-editrix-shot-sixth-time-weekend-publisher.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="The Weekend Publisher, contemplating vaccination" title="The Weekend Publisher, contemplating vaccination" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Ok, technically, we're not _all_ boosted here.  The Weekend Publisher has been lagging
behind, as shown here in his favorite "lagging behind" pose. Not because he's a vaccine
denialist, of course; he is, after all, _my_ cat!  Rather because veterinary vaccines are
not yet available. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

But when feline vaccines are available&hellip; there's gonna be a coupla quick trips to
the vet, followed by some cat treats to restore diplomatic relations to a state of general
amity and decorum.  

(Also, I may have exaggerated that part back there about the zeppelin.)  


## Addendum 2021-Oct-28: Side effects  

Well, that turned out to be a bit rougher than either of us thought it would be.  

Both of us had relatively mild reactions to 2 doses of Pfizer, and I had a mild reaction
to the 3rd Pfizer booster.  We figured that Moderna at half dose in the booster should be
comparable.  

Wrong: today she has +3&deg;C fever, aches all over, extreme fatigue.  After digging around
the CDC advisories, we figured out that
[Tylenol/acetaminophen was ok if taken a while _after_ the vaccination](https://apnews.com/article/can-i-take-painkillers-before-after-covid-19-vaccine-86f03cdeb208e058f82032ed8548a219).
So at VAX + 14 hours this morning, we got a couple time-release
acetaminophens in her that will work for the next 8 hours.  After breakfast (and after
retrieving with me the Weekend Publisher from the back yard, the little snot having
escaped the tent on the back deck into the wilds of the back yard) and a light lunch, she
went back to bed.  Sleeping now, with a cold compress on her forehead.  

So it doesn't _look_ serious, but it does look annoying.  

I'm slightly jealous: I want _my_ immune system to work that hard building immunity for
me, too.  (Yes, I know: this is the innate immune system, not the acquired immune system
which is the one that matters.  Still!)  

Updates later when things change.  


## Addendum 2021-Oct-29: Side effects abate  

All better.  Fever reduced, aches & pains fading.  Still a bit of a headache, but overall
ok.
