**DRAFT** [Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) why vaccinated people in the
US seemed to be always so angry at the unvaccinated.   Hmpf.  


## So&hellip; _are_ the vaccinated angry?  

Damn right, we are!  

Here we've been doing the right things: masking, social distancing, getting vaccinated,
remote work when possible, and so on.  It's been hard, but it's doable for the most part.
(Special sympathy for essential workers, or those in miserable jobs where they can't avoid
contact, and so on.)  

But the knuckleheads who think COVID is a hoax, or that it's caused by 5G networks, or
that the vaccine will sterilize you or microchip you or magnetize you or give you the Mark
of the Beast or&hellip; it just makes me feel ill to go on.  They're the ones holding back
the economy; they're the ones _on the side of the virus_ helping it breed new variants;
they're the ones poisoning each other's minds with nonsense.

A recent _NYT_ article <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> sums it up (before diving into
endless anecdotes, as is the wont of most reporters):  

> As coronavirus cases resurge across the country, many inoculated Americans are losing
> patience with vaccine holdouts who, they say, are neglecting a civic duty or clinging to
> conspiracy theories and misinformation even as new patients arrive in emergency rooms
> and the nation renews mask advisories.  
>  
> The country seemed to be exiting the pandemic; barely a month ago, a sense of
> celebration was palpable. Now many of the vaccinated fear for their unvaccinated
> children and worry that they are at risk themselves for breakthrough infections. Rising
> case rates are upending plans for school and workplace reopenings, and threatening
> another wave of infections that may overwhelm hospitals in many communities.

And it's not just a few people here, a few people there.  It's very specifically the
American South and the Mountain West.  Take a look at the map on the right from the CDC
COVID tracker project <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, showing degree of community spread
at the county level in the US.  Remember where the Confederacy was in the US Civil War?
They never really went away, you know.  They're just the Repubican base now.  Very
Republican, and very base.

Paul Krugman, the 2008 Nobelist in economics with a part-time columnist gig at the _New York
Times_, put it succinctly <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>:  COVID has become a red-state
crisis, and they're trying to drag down the rest of us with them:  
- 47% of Republicans say they'll refuse vaccination, versus 6% of Democrats  
- As [we've shown here before]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccinations-vs-votes) (a 
  [couple of times]({{ site.baseurl }}/politics-vs-mask-and-vaccine-use/)), Krugman
  confirms the strong negative correlation between Trump voting and vaccination.  
- There is strong geographic concentration, as the map shows.  Krugman points out that New
  York City has 5 COVID patients hospitalized per 100,000 people; Florida has 34.  That's
  almost 7x greater!  Florida governor DeSantis has barred businesses from requiring
  proof of vaccination, which is just 
  [feeding people into the red-hot jaws of Moloch.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)  

The places needing NPI (non-pharmaceutical interventions like masking) on top of
vaccination are almost surely the ones that will shout "Freedumb!" and refuse.  

So, yeah&hellip; mad.  


## Variants  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-29-anger-among-vaccinated-covariants.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="CoVariants.org: Dominance of the Delta strain of SARS-CoV-2" title="CoVariants.org: Dominance of the Delta strain of SARS-CoV-2" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

In the meantime, the virus is honing its skills at infecting people.  Because _of course_
it is.  The Delta variant is _extremely_ virulent, to the point where once it gets a
foothold, it outcompetes all the other strains and becomes virtually the _only_ strain
infecting a population.  

Consider this graph at right, from [CoVariants.org](https://covariants.org).
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  It shows the prevalence of the different variants as a
function of time, in the US.  The Delta variant is in green.  Note that, since its
introduction in April 2021, it has _driven out all other COVID variants_.  

So there's your evidence that the Delta variant is way _worse_ than the others in terms of
infection rate: it's driven the others to near-extinction.  

You don't want to mess with it.  If you're unvaccinated and haven't already had COVID-19,
then you _will_ get the Delta variant of COVID-19.  You don't want that; there's evidence
that mortality is also worse with Delta.  

Your best alternative is to get vaccinated.  


## Beginnings of Breakthrough Infections  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-29-anger-among-vaccinated-nejm.jpg" width="400" height="204" alt="NEJM: Israeli data on breakthrough infections in the vaccinated" title="NEJM: Israeli data on breakthrough infections in the vaccinated" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
From the _New England Journal of Medicine_ comes yet another Israeli study of breakthrough COVID-19
infections in healtcare workers. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  They began receiving
vaccinations in late 2020, so this is basically looking back at a 6 month period.  
- Now, healthcare workers are _not_ typical COVID risk compared to the rest of us civilians: they
  are exposed, over and over, every day, to patients with severe COVID.  So any risk we see
  here will be _higher_ than you or I might experience.  
- On the other hand, over the period of the study, the Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) was
  dominant (about 85% of the samples).  So that's _less_ risk than you or I might
  experience.  
  
The first result: out of $N = 1497$ fully vaccinated healthcare workers, they observed 39
SARS-CoV2 breakthrough infections.  Crudely, that's a rate (or probability/unit time) of:  

$$
\frac{dp_{\mathrm{COVID}}}{dt} = \frac{39}{1497} = 2.6\% / 6\mathrm{ months}
$$

Using our usual method of posterior Beta distributions to estimate a 95% confidence
interval on this, we get:  

```R
> qbeta(p = c(0.025, 0.975), shape1 = 39 + 1, shape2 = 1497 - 39 + 1)
[1] 0.01914348 0.03541974
```

That's pretty good, really: 2.6%/6 months (95% CL: 1.9% &ndash; 3.5%).  

What's got people squirming somewhat uncomfortably, though, is the rate of "long COVID".
They defined this as &gt; 6 weeks of symptoms.  Here they lost 3 patients to follow-up,
known in the biz and "censoring".  (Though they don't make this obvious: you have to dig
into the supplementary material, page 5, to find this out!)  So their rate of long COVID
is an eye-popping:  

$$
\frac{dp_{\mathrm{longCOVID}}}{dt} = \frac{7}{36} = 19.4\% / 6\mathrm{ months}
$$

That's a scary large number!  But it's only 36 patients, so we really should estimate the
95% confidence interval to see how seriously to take it:  

```R
> qbeta(p = c(0.025, 0.975), shape1 = 7 + 1, shape2 = 36 - 7 + 1)
[1] 0.09826564 0.35155238
```

So that's a nice wide confidence interval, from 9.8% &ndash; 35.1% per 6 months.  In fact,
it's wide enough to make this not terribly meaningful: they've shown long COVID in
breakthrough cases _can_ happen, but we don't have much information on how often beyond a
vague sense that it might be more than we'd like.  

That's what exploratory studies are like, with very small samples.  But now somebody else
can use this to design an adequately powered study of long COVID breakthrough infections,
and this can guide them about the number of patients to follow.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Yeah, we vaccinated folk are mad at the willfully unvaccinated folk.  (Those unvaccinated
for valid medical reasons like immunosuppression or cancer treatment of course get a pass,
and our sympathy.)  The unvaccinated are prolonging the pandemic, breeding variants, and
just generally damaging the lives of everybody else&hellip; for no good reason.
