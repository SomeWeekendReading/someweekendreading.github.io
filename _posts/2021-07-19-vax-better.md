Periodically I meet people who think "natural" immunity from having had COVID-19 is
somehow better than being vaccinated.  A new Israeli study plumbs the depths of just how
_wrong_ that is.  


## "Natural" immunity  

People just get _hypnotized_ by the word "natural", as though it were synonymous with
"good".  As we've
[explored before on this crummy little blog that nobody reads]({{ site.baseurl }}/natural-vs-vaccine-immunity),
natural immunity is generally inferior to vaccination:  
- First you have to go through the harrowing experience of having COVID-19, avoid
  long-term damage to organs (including brain damage!), and not be long-term disabled.  You also
  might use up hospital beds, ICU beds, and ventilators in the meantime, meaning someone
  _else_ will die from the lack thereof.  
- Then, you get immunity of approximately 83% efficacy, whereas an mRNA vaccine will get
  you something around 95% with way less trouble.  (Both figures are for the "classic" SARS-CoV2
  virus; a bit lower for the new Delta variant).  
  
So the vaccine gets you _better_ immunity, _faster_ immunity, and _safer_ immunity than
the "natural" immunity.  You really have to be hypnotized to choose "natural" here.  


## What about antibody levels?

A recent Israeli study by Shapira, _et al._ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> on the 
_medR&chi;iv_ preprint server (not yet peer reviewed) tells us about the antibody levels
between convalescent patients who have suffered through COVID-19, and those who have
received the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine.  

And it's not just a _little_ study: because nations like Israel have absolutely
_universal_ health care systems with uniform databases, unlike the rather backward
American system, they can do all sorts of good stuff.  Here, for example, the study
authors compared blood samples from $N = 26,170$ patients.  Of those:  
- 13.4% had gotten the Pfizer vaccine,  
-  6.3% were recovering from symptomatic, PCR-verified COVID-19, and  
- 80.5% were asymptomatic but found in routine checkups.  

Their age ranges were quite wide, from infants to the 80s-90s.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-19-vax-better-medrxiv-fig1.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Israeli study: Violin plot of distribution of antibody levels in convalescent vs vaccinated patients" title="Israeli study: Violin plot of distribution of antibody levels in convalescent vs vaccinated patients" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-19-vax-better-medrxiv-fig3.jpg" width="400" height="320" alt="Israeli study: Antibody levels by age, comparing natural vs vaccinated patients" title="Israeli study: Antibody levels by age, comparing natural vs vaccinated patients" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The key result is Figure 1: a violin plot of antibody levels in asymptomatic unvaccinated (orange),
recovering symptomatic (light blue), and vaccinated patients (dark blue).  If you've never
seen a violin plot: the antibody level is on the vertical axis, the horizontal black line
is the median, and the width gives you an idea of the probability distribution of the
antibody level.  

__The brute-force conclusion:__ Vaccinated patients have about _4 times the antibody levels_
compared to those poor souls trying to make do with "natural" immunity.  _Vaccination is
better!_  

Figure 3 is also interesting: it shows the antibody levels as a function of age, for the
"natural" groups and the vaccinated group.  
- Especially for the young, the vaccinatedimmunity is dramatically better.  
- But since for the old, COVID-19 is a life-threatening event and vaccination is not, it's
  important to note that we oldsters can still get immunity _better than from "natural"
  recovery_ with just a shot and no life threatening illness.  It's more like 1.5x better
  instead of the 4x better that the youngs get, but still it comes wihtout risk to ones life.  

__The other brute-force conclusion:__ Vaccinated patients, across all age groups, are
better off than the "natrual" immunity of convalescent patients.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Look, just get vaccinated, ok?  

You know it's the right thing to do.  Do it for yourself, for your family, for your
neighbors, for your country, for humanity, and for not breeding more variants.  It really
couldn't be more clear.
