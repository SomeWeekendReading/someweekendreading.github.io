The GPU chipmakers, data center operators, and AI companies are apparently involved in an
immense series of what look like kickbacks to each other, masquerading as economic
activity.  


## Hank Green: Boggled by Circular Investment Flows

While checking in with [Hank Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Green), I came
across a video he did on the circular investment pattern in AI companies.  Now, it's the
usual Hank fare: fast talking, "gee, isn't _this_ interesting", and lots of fun data to
think about.  If you like that kind of thing, he's a master of the form, managing to be
simultaneously informative and entertaining (as one would expect of a science popularizer!).  


## Digging Deeper

But let's dig into the primary sources, as we often do on this Crummy Little Blog That
Nobody Reads (CLBTNR). He's talking about a recent Bloomberg article <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
which contains the graph shown here.  (Definitely click to embiggen!)  

Basically, there are 3 sorts of actors in this drama:
- _The chipmakers like Nvidia, AMD, and (to some extent) Intel._  They make the chips, mostly
  GPUs, that power the matrix calculations used in what amounts to neural net LLMs.  
- _The data center operators like Oracle build huge data centers with enormous computing
  power._  They rent this out to the AI companies, _q.v._  (They also consume entire city's
  worth of electricity and guzzle clean water for cooling; the rest of us would probably
  prefer not to get higher electricity bills and have more water available.)  
- _The AI companies who rent this compute capability._   Sometimes these are  upstarts
  like OpenAI (worth a mere \\$500 billion, also with a mere \\$12 billion revenue and
  negative earnings).  Sometimes they're Microsoft and Google, who are maddeningly
  determined to force AI into everything, whether you want it or not. (I do _not._)  
  
Sometimes the middleman, the data center operator, is there and sometimes it's not because
the data center has been absorbed into a giant like Google or Microsoft.  But that's more
or less the _dramatis personae._  

Now, on to the drama.  Here are a couple examples from the opening of the _Bloomberg_
article:  
- Nvidia 'invests' \\$100 billion in OpenAI, to fund a data center with the electrical
  consumption of a major city.  In return, OpenAI commits to buying billions worth of
  Nvidia chips.  
- Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and OpenAI have a similar deal, on the tens of billions in
  scale.  
- OpenAI struck a \\$300 billion deal with Oracle to build massive data centers, powered
  with Nvidia chips.  Oracle is then renting that capacity back to OpenAI, with guarantees
  that OpenAI will lease all of it.  Oracle can now book \\$100's of billions in
  revenue&hellip; sometime in the future from a company with \\$12 billion in revenue and
  negative earnings&hellip; somehow.  
- Similarly, Nvidia has 'invested' in CoreWeave, 'sold' them chips paid for out of that
  investment, and guaranteed to buy all the compute power that CoreWeave's AI customers
  don't buy.  That's a great risk arbitrage for CoreWeave, but it means Nvidia's taking
  almost insane levels of risk.  
  
In other words, the hardware makers are _paying their customers to buy their products._
This is not outside investment, it's just a handful of companies moving money around and
variously calling it 'investment' or 'revenue', as they please.  

There are _tons_ of other examples in the _Bloomberg_ article.  The graph above summarizes
just some of it.  A couple dozen companies are shifting around commitments to invest, then
hardware, and finally services.  Sometimes this is an investment, sometimes it's revenue.

It looks corrupt as hell to me, and that's not even counting Trump's extortion of part of
the cash flow to Nvidia and AMD.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> It also looks like the
cross-selling financial [_ouroboros,_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) among
late-90s startups, just before the dot-com crash.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-10-17-hank-green-ai-circular-investments-history-1.jpg" width="400" height="473" alt="Klein @ History.com: How the Gilded Age's Top 1 Percent Thrived on Corruption" title="Klein @ History.com: How the Gilded Age's Top 1 Percent Thrived on Corruption" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

In fact, this begins to resemble the 19th century corruption of the Gilded Age, which must
now regrettably be called the "First" Gilded Age.  Between the circular movement of money,
bizarre accounting for when it gets called revenue, and Trump's extortion of a cut of the
trade, this is _exactly_ what was done then  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>:

We really _are_ in a Second Gilded Age of corrupt oligarchs, monopolies, and politicians,
aren't we?  


## A Contrary Opinion  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJ_LUeJHziQ" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
Now, not everybody agrees with me, sadly.  

But in a spirit of objectivity that is the _sine qua non_ of all scientists, let's have a
look at _another_ Bloomberg interview that offers a contrary opinion.  

This one is with Mandeep Singh, their Bloomberg Intelligence Global Head of Technology
Research. A heuristic I learned many years ago is perhaps too sarcastic, but sometimes
applies: the importance of your position is inversely proportional to the number of words
in your title.  Example: "President" is pretty important.  Example: "Deputy Undersecretary
for Intergovernmental Affairs in Cheese Trade" is&hellip; less important.  I'm not saying
that this applies to Mr. Singh, but I am revealing to you my bias.  Discount
appropriately.  

His argument is, in essence, that AI demand will _definitely_ undergo hyperscaling levels
of growth, because everybody wants it.  Now, that's contrary to my experience, where
pretty much _nobody_ wants it and examples abound of AI used ignorantly go create
everything from absurdities to life-endangering hazards.  But, _if_ his "definitely"
scenario is true, in order to profit from it you need to grow as fast as possible.  

The circular funding arrangements that appear so corrupt to me, are to him just a way of
companies lending each other resources to grow.  

Will it collapse?  Singh is optimistic:  

> &hellip; yes, there will be probably some misallocation of capital that we'll find out in
> retrospect that this capital was misallocated in some way.  But right now, it's very hard
> to question the pace of this build-out because there's still that big gap between demand
> and supply.  And until that narrows, it's hard to question why capital is going in this
> domain, because, I mean, it should.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jan-brueghel-younger-allegory-on-tulip-mania-1640.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/jan-brueghel-younger-allegory-on-tulip-mania-1640-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="254" alt="Jan Brueghel the Younger, 'Allegory on Tulipmania', 1640" title="Jan Brueghel the Younger, 'Allegory on Tulipmania', 1640" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Now, I think he's _deeply_ deluded:
[the Dutch tulip prices in the 1630s kept going up too&hellip; until they didn't](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania).
But that's his viewpoint, presented in as honest a fashion as I am capable of doing.  

There is, of course, uncertainty!  In the words of the _Bloomberg_ article, describing the power of
Sam Altman, as CEO of OpenAI:  

> Altman "has the power to crash the global economy for a decade or take us all to the
> promised land," Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research, wrote in an investor
> note this week. "Right now we don't know which is in the cards."

Personally, I think he's driving all of us into a crash, or worse.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Go look at that _Bloomberg_ diagram which so fascinated Hank.  It's pretty damning.  

AI/LLMs are a bigger bubble than the 2007-2008 financial panic, and bigger than the 2000 dot-com
crash.  This time, with what looks like a side of self-serving kickbacks.  

Didn't that used to be illegal?  

Here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, it's oligarch crap like this that made us 
[reallocate our retirement portfolio]({{ stie.baseurl }}/weekend-portfolio-trump-2/) to be
the most defensive it's ever been in our lifetimes.  We still don't know if that will be
enough.
