Alas, for the [Arecibo Observatory/National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecibo_Observatory) is no more.

Sad news: the Arecibo Observatory, already badly damaged from a snapped cable, has
collapsed.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> The first
photo is a satellite image from the _NYT_ showing damage to the dish from an auxiliary
cable that snapped and left a 100 foot gash.  The second, from the _BBC_, shows the
900-ton instrument platform after it fell 400 ft down onto the dish at 7:55am local time
(11:55 GMT) today.  

Needless to say, it is beyond repair.  

Needless to say, our barbaric rulers will refuse to rebuild, and likely will not even
_comprehend_ the loss.  

It's kind of personal with me: in my younger days, I had a housemate who was doing his PhD
in [SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence) work.
While Arecibo wasn't his main thing, he did spend time there and told us enthusiastic
stories.

I feel like some ancient Roman scholar, tearfully watching the barbarians destroying a
civilization as they break what they cannot understand.  Or like some ancient Alexandrine,
watching and weeping as fanatics burn the Library they could not read.  Or an ancient
Pompeiian, watching from a distance as indifferent nature destroys the beloved city that is home
and hearth.
