The cameras, facial recognition, and snoopy cops without warrants haven't gone away.  Need
new clothes for some reason?  


## Camouflage for Civilians

Previously, on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), we've written about
various kinds of clothing to resist blanket, warrantless
surveillance. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  Well&hellip; the cameras are still here
along with near-universal distaste for this corporate and government imposition.  That's a
potential market, and someone has decided to go for it.  

The latest article <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> is from January 2023, so I'm (almost)
embarrassed not to have found it for the previous blog post in October 2023.  Still, better
late than never.  

It points us to an Italian clothing start-up called
[Cap_able or Capable Design](https://www.capable.design/).  Their rather busily
patterned clothing is made so not for visual appeal, but to deter surveillance.  They've
trained on [YOLO](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) ("You Only Look Once"), a fast
object-detection algorithm.  It either decides there's nothing there, or identifies you as
one of the animals encoded into the pattern in some way.  Experimentally, it does seem to
defeat human recognition algorithms ("is there a person here?"), but according to
commenters it does _not_ defeat facial recognition algorithms ("there is a human here, who
is it?").  

While it may obscure you to some recognition algorithms (emphasis _some_, as they
can't test on all of them, most of which are kept secret), it makes you _more_ conspicuous
to humans.  Lots of people will ask why you're wearing something like that, I bet.  

They claim their clothing is legal, in line with the European GDPR.  Of course, more
fascist-adjacent governments like the US will hurry to outlaw it, which will probably
trigger interesting Supreme Court cases.  Especially _this_ bought-and-paid-for Supreme
Court.  

Now, this is a small operation: there are all of 8 products on their web site.  Also, the
price is _not_ exactly affordable: shirts, pants, and dresses range from <span>$</span>412
to <span>$</span>745 _each._  This is, I suppose, much as one might expect of an Italian
clothing start-up.  

So, I dunno.  I applaud giving ordinary folk the chance to resist constant surveillance.
On the other hand, it's trained on exactly 1 algorithm, kind of ugly, and very pricey.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Here on this CLBTNR, we hate unbridled surveillance.  But the cameras won't go away, at
least not until we make right-wing corporatist governments go away.  

In the meantime: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)
