Saturday, we went to a concert by the Spectrum Singers in Cambridge, at the historic First
Church Congregational.  I was a little apprehensive about Schoenberg and Ives, but looked
forward to the Vaughan Williams.  


## The Occasion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-globe-1.jpg" width="400" height="460" alt="Symkus @ Boston Globe: Last Spectrum Singers concert for music director John Ehrlich" title="Symkus @ Boston Globe: Last Spectrum Singers concert for music director John Ehrlich" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The [Spectrum Singers](https://www.spectrumsingers.org/) is a very high-quality choral
group, well known in Cambridge for many years.  They're occasionally described as "hip
classical", or invoking the word "spectrum" to describe the broad range of the choral
repertoire they explore &ndash; from early music to the 20th century.  (Though, barbarian
that I am, I always mis-hear it as "Spectral Singers" and think about a choir of ghosts.)  

Recently John Ehrlich, their music director for the last 44 years, decided to retire.  In
various talks, he's described his motivation as making sure Spectrum Singers didn't become
the John Ehrlich Singers.  The venerable _Globe_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> has the
goods.  


## The Venue  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-venue.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-venue-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="The concert venue: First Church Congregational, in Cambridge MA, USA" title="The concert venue: First Church Congregational, in Cambridge MA, USA" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Traditionally the venue for Spectrum Singers is
[First Church Congregational, in Cambridge](https://www.firstchurchcambridge.org/).
(Other musical organizations performing there are the [Boston Early Music Festival](https://bemf.org/),
the [Cantata Singers](https://www.cantatasingers.org/), the 
[Seraphim Singers](https://seraphimsingers.org/), and others.  

Congregational churches (now UCC) have a deep history in New England, and indeed are the
denomination of my youth.  While this congregation goes back to 1633, the current building
dates to 1872.  This photo, from their web site, shows the interior of the worship space.
It is architecturally reminiscent of a cathedral, with transept and nave as shown here.  
- A number of the stained-glass windows are Tiffany originals.  Given the date, they were
  buying from Tiffany before that became a _really big deal_, so these are early works.
  Alas, we were there at night, so the lighting was suboptimal for enjoying the windows.  
- The arches around the transept/nave/bema are all curiously 7-sided.  There's usually
  some significance to things like that, but the symbolism of 7 escapes me.  
- You can see some medallions in the spandrels at the top of the arches.  The marginal vision
  of my now-ancient eyes makes them difficult to make out in detail.  But some glaring at them
  after the concert seems to have revealed that one was a capital &Alpha;/&Omega; motif and
  the other a capital &Chi;. Given the congregational history, they of course makes sense
  as Christological symbols.  

So it's basically a beautiful old building: about 150 years as a physical construct, and
about 400 years as a social one.  Needless to say, _every single thing you see_ is crafted
to make you think about deeper meanings.  (There are, of course, anachronisms that are
inevitable in any building remodeled for comfortable modern use.  For example, there are
electrical outlets at the _top_ of each pillar, just above the Corinthian capitals.  That
caused me to smile a couple times, because I love the fact that it's both anachronistic
and that it shows the determination people have to continue using the building 
comfortably.)  


## The Program  

A pre-concert lecture by Steve Ledbetter was quite informative, telling us a bit about
each of the composers as _people_, not just as musical giants.  I have a soft spot in my
heart (and possibly in my skull) for trying to regard people as fully-formed human beings,
not just as the source of whatever work they did.  People are not instrumental goals, we
are end goals in ourselves.  

[Charles Ives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ives), for example, was also an
actuary (Math Tribe! Math Tribe!  Math Tribe!) and invented a lot of the business
practices in modern insurance, such as insurance for estate planing. Given his love of
dissonance in music, it seems only apt that his spouse was named Harmony.

Upon taking our seats, it struck me that&hellip; well, as you can see here, they certainly
didn't waste money on any fancy-pants printing of the tickets!  (Though, to be sure, in
the modern American political parlance, I _am_ a left-wing voter in a blue state, so "BLUE
LEFT" is ironically apt.)  

Yes, it's a small thing.  It still amuses me, though, in a frugal New Englander sort of way.  Be
proud of the music, don't worry about the rest.  Good job there, with unpretentious tickets.  

Now, the program, on the other hand&hellip; you can't call your concert "Time, Space,
Peace, Music, God" and _not_ be a little bit pretentious!  I don't quite recognize the
astrophotography, and the program itself carefully avoids giving credit.  

But&hellip; when you look over the pieces, they are also cosmic, almost 
[in the old-style Russian sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_cosmism) of seeing
the divine in the ordinary and the human.  

None of the composers would agree that this inspired them, and musicologists would just
laugh at the comparison.  Still, it seemed to me that finding the extraordinary in the
ordinary is a useful skill.  Almost anything is interesting, if examined closely enough.
(And that may well be the theme of this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR).)  

The pieces in the program shown here, while definitely not all to my personal taste,
nonetheless are consumed with beauty and loss, followed by the hope for better days,
better lives, and better spirits.  They're each&hellip; _odd._  Schoenberg chose to write a
dissonant piece for a text about forming piece.  Whitman was&hellip; well, just being
Whitman is enough, isn't it?  Vaughan Williams was a welcome balm for the brain, after the
more dissonant pieces preceding him.  

All these composers were alive at approximately the same time, at least overlapping to
some degree, writing 1907 - 1938.  It always surprises me to be reminded the degree to
which World War I absolutely shocked and scarred the world.  (Indeed, in 1923 Schoenberg
wrote to a friend that he no longer thought world peace could be possible.)  Today, having
survived World War II and numerous lesser &ndash; but even more pointlessly brutal &ndash;
conflicts, we tend to underestimate that.  People wondered how it could even be possible
to return to normalcy, in a world where "normal" seemed to have been utterly mutilated.   

Still, [as we previously wrote on this CLBTNR]({{ site.baseurl }}/greens-asymmetry),
artists responded in sometimes encouraging ways, as with WH Auden's "September 1, 1939".
Perhaps, like these composers, we need to learn to "show an affirming flame" in these
fascism-darkened times.  


## The Pieces  

Let's go through the program and think about what we heard and read.  

### Schoenberg: _Friede auf Erden_ (1907)  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4niz8TfY794?si=IIzACutCNmo3nLdA" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-schoenberg.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-schoenberg-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Playing Arnold Schoenberg's 'Friede auf Erden'" title="Playing Arnold Schoenberg's 'Friede auf Erden'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
What can one say about [Arnold Schoenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schoenberg)?
You either love his music or hate it, and I am not numbered among those who love it.
Dissonance is not my main drag.  12-tone is annoyingly incomprehensible.  (With probably 1
exception: mathemusician (self-yclept) Vi Hart's magisterial and hilarious tutorial
video. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>)  

Yes, this betrays me as remarkably unsophisticated.  (Just to seal your low opinion of my low
taste, I don't care for jazz, either.)  In Japanese, I am a ダサい 野蛮人 (_dasai yabanjin_, 
approximately "uncool barbarian").  Yes, [_mea culpa_]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#MeaCulpa).
_Mea maxima culpa_.  

Just _listening_ to Schoenberg, without context, is for me approximately like having acid
dripped slowly into my skull.  Fortunately, that was not the case here: we were in a beautifully
contemplative setting and there was a poem being set that I could appreciate.  
He chose a difficult poem by Swiss poet Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, "Friede auf Erden" ("Peace
on Earth").  The excellent translation in the notes was by
[Bernie Greenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Greenberg), my former
colleague in the old days at [Symbolics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics).  

In Ehrlich's own program notes, he describes it as:  

> Schoenberg's thorny, conflicted yet cautiously optimistic plea for peace now seems
> all-too appropriate for our presently fraught times&hellip;  

So&hellip; it began with relative harmony, but then the usual acid begin slowly dripping
into my skull.  However &ndash; and this is really saying something &ndash; the text
completely redeemed the experience for me.  

Meyer's poem, in Bernie's skillful translation, echoed the frustration, dread, and anxiety
felt by all of us without power, who watch those with power stumble determinedly toward
fascism and cruelty:  

> Yet survives belief eternal  
> that the weak shall not forever  
> fall as helpless victims to each  
> murd'rer' fresh indignity.  
> Righteousness, or something kin,  
> weaves and works in  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rout and horror,  
> and a kingdom yet shall rise up  
> seeking Peace upon the Earth.  

The idea that chaos and evil are the necessary soil in which righteousness can grow is
uncomfortably familiar. So the Schoenbergian dissonance actually _works_ for me (much to
my surprise!) as a way of describing the painful chaos in the world.  

Toward the end, it becomes more harmonic in D-major, when Meyer's poem &ndash; like all
good Psalms &ndash; visualizes a more perfected world:  

> Slowly shall its form develop,  
> holy duties while fulfilling,  
> weapons free of danger forging,  
> flaming swords for cause of Right.  
> And a royal line shall bloom,  
> mighty royal sons shall flourish,  
> whose bright trumpets peal  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proclaiming,  
> Peace, O Peace upon the Earth!  

I absolutely love the idea of turning "weapons of war" on its head as a metaphor, so we
forge 'weapons' free of danger, like flaming swords that do only good.  

It's a reminder, mildly painful in a good way, of a piece in
[CS Lewis's _The Great Divorce_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Divorce)
<sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, another work written in the context of a Great War, like
the other pieces in this concert.  I'm not normally a big fan of Lewis.  He appeals to
fundamentalists for some reason, and that's probably why he does _not_ appeal to me.  For
_The Great Divorce_ (and his lecture, "On Transposition"), I make exceptions.  They are both
really mind-changing for me.  

In _The Great Divorce_ (chapter 11) there is a scene where a man has a lizard on his
shoulder, representing his sinful nature.  An angel offers to kill it with a burning hands
(reminiscent, at least, of a flaming sword).  In the end, he does this.  The man becomes
more perfected, and the lizard becomes a horse which he rides into deeper heaven.  

The moral, apparently, is that our sins are energy _in need of redirection._  

_That_ is the sort of weapon I would cheerfully help to forge.  And only that: the flaming
sword becomes less of a weapon to hurt, and more of a scalpel to heal.  The thought of it
actually makes a Schoenberg with the harmony-dissonance-harmony journey worth taking.  

### Vaughan Williams: _Towards the Unknown Region_ (1906)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-vaughan-williams-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-vaughan-williams-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Playing Ralph Vaughan Williams's 'Toward the Unknown Region'" title="Playing Ralph Vaughan Williams's 'Toward the Unknown Region'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
After the harmonically bruising experience of Schoenberg, we need some healing balm.  I
remarked to a friend who is in the Spectrum Singers, that there's a _reason_ Vaughan Williams
pieces immediately followed Schoenberg and Ives.  

This piece is based on [Walt Whitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman)'s poem
["Towards the Unknown Region"](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass_(1882)/Whispers_of_Heavenly_Death/Darest_Thou_Now_O_Soul),
aka "Darest Thou Now O Soul", from
[_Leaves of Grass_ (1881-1882)](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leaves_of_Grass_(1882)).
(NB: The program notes say "Toward", but apparently Whitman wrote "Towards".  I will now
stifle my inner pedant.)  

Now we're breaking out the heavy artillery!  US Republicans are currently engaged in a
book-banning spree against allegedly dangerous books.  Of course they pick the _wrong_
books!  And they have no appreciation of just _how_ wonderfully dangerous some books are,
and why that is A Good Thing.  

Reading as a young man, Whitman wounded me in a way that will never heal, and which I will
never want to heal.  Apparently Ralph ("Rafe") Vaughan Williams never got over it either.
One must expect that of dangerous literature.  Like
[Cabell's _Music from Behind the Moon_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Music_from_Behind_the_Moon/MwA-AAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover) <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, 
it fills one with a strange longing that can never be satisfied until the world, and
oneself, is forever changed.  As Cabell wrote of altogether different music,  

> It was a strange and troubling music she made there in the twilight, and after that the
> slender mist-like woman had ended her music-making, and had vanished as a white wave
> falters and is gone, then Madoc could not recall the theme or even one cadence of her
> music-making, nor could he put the skirling of it out of his mind.  Moreover, there was
> upon him a loneliness and a hungering for what he could not name.  

Whitman hit me like that, when I was a kid too young to defend myself.  Well, if the theme
of this concert is "beauty and loss", we're pretty much on target here.  

It's hard to appreciate Whitman enough nowadays, with the ideals of democracy and free-thinking
built into American society right down to the keel-blocks (with notable exceptions of
late for Republicans repenting of democracy, e.g., Washington Republican officials saying
"We do not want to be a democracy."  <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>).  For late
Victorians, that hit like a bombshell.  

Whitman, for me, is all about facing death ("&hellip; to die is different from what any one
supposed, and luckier", as he put it elsewhere in _Leaves of Grass_).  "Toward(s!) the
Unknown Region" is about being brave enough to step confidently into the dark.  As an old
man who thinks more about personal death than I used to, the ending still brings tears to my eyes:  

> Till, when the ties loosen,  
> All but the ties eternal, Time and Space,  
> Nor darkness, gravitation, sense, nor any bounds bounding us.  
>  
> Then we burst forth, we float,  
> In Time and Space O soul, prepared for them,  
> Equal, equipt at last, (O joy!  O fruit of all!) them to fulfill, O soul.  

I may not have strong faith, but I have hope.  Perhaps we can "fulfill" nature; maybe one
day I'll even understand what that means. Whitman was, as far as I can tell, crazy as a
loon &ndash; but it was [the Divine Madness]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#TheDivineMadness).  

### Ives: _Psalm 90_ (1924)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-ives.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-ives-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Playing Charles Ives's 'Psalm 90'" title="Playing Charles Ives's 'Psalm 90'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Ok, Ives next.  Again, this is a composer whose music does not move me, but his source
material is excellent, in the choice of Psalm 90.  Generally, I love the Psalms, especially
the central Davidic ones that start with despair and end with hope.  

Ehrlich says in his program notes that this piece may be the only one with which Ives was
ever fully satisfied:  

> &hellip; Charles Ives's truly cosmic setting of _Psalm 90_, with it extraordinarily
> exposition of music and text oscillating between conflict and resolution&hellip;  

A cosmic view is appropriate here, since the source text is&hellip; well, cosmic.  The
first 2/3 is (almost) despairing at the cruelty of the world and our short lifespans
within it.  Ives is appropriately dissonant, conflicted, and difficult.  I spent some time
watching the musicians on the tubular bells, and seeing the gates of the great organ open
and close when the music was too overwhelming to bear.  

But then at the end comes a prayer and its musical resolution:  

> O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.  
> Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.  
> Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.  
> And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hand establish thou it.  Amen.  

Indeed, transcendence and immanence: the world can be better, let us help each other to _do_ better.  

### Vaughan Williams: _Serenade to Music_ (1938)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-vaughan-williams-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-vaughan-williams-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Playing Ralph Vaughan Williams's 'Serenade to Music'" title="Playing Ralph Vaughan Williams's 'Serenade to Music'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Where Ehrlich's program notes mention "beauty and loss" as a theme for the night, some of it
is apparently quite personal:  

> &hellip; I knew long ago that I wanted Ralph Vaughan Williams' _Serenade to Music_ to be
> my final farewell, as it seemed to philosophically and musically contain, with hits
> superbly appropriate text from Shakespeare, much of what has been important to my love
> of music and subsequent music-making.  Not coincidentally,l this work was first brought
> to my attention by a childhood friend, who only last month I learned had unexpectedly
> passed away.  I will have his memory in mind as this music flows forth tonight.  

And of course, more Vaughan Williams was a welcome balm after the dissonance.  

The text is from Shakespeare, _The Merchant of Venice_, Act V, Scene 1.  It is difficult
to appreciate what would later be called the "music of the sphere" that has a divine
nature, while we are mortal beings:  

> Such harmony is in immortal souls;  
>  
> But whilst this muddy vesture of decay  
> Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.  

Yes, it's hard to perceive the divine:  

> I am never merry when I hear sweet music.  
>  
> The reason is, your spirits are attentive:  
> The man that hath no music in himself,  
> Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,  
> Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;  
> The motions of his spirit are as dull as night, 
> And his affections are as dark as Erebus;  
>  
> Let no such man be trusted.  

That's very much in line with
[a sentiment of Sappho we've quoted before on this CLBTNR]({{ site.baseurl }}/long-time-no-blog#dishonorable-mention).
When Sen Tuberville of Alabama criticized the crew of a US Navy ship for having a poetry night,
[Sappho #65, "To One Who Loved Not Poetry,"](https://sacred-texts.com/cla/usappho/sph66.htm)
was just about the only thing to say to barbarians who reject poetry:  

>κατθάνοισα δὲ κείσῃ οὐδέ ποτα  
>μναμοσύνα σέθεν  
>ἔσσετ' οὐδὲ †ποκ'†ὔστερον· οὐ  
>γὰρ πεδέχῃς βρόδων  
>τῶν ἐκ Πιερίας· ἀλλ' ἀφάνης  
>κἠν Ἀίδα δόμῳ  
>φοιτάσεις πεδ' ἀμαύρων νεκύων  
>ἐκπεποταμένα[8]  
>  
>But thou shalt ever lie dead,  
>nor shall there be any remembrance of thee then or thereafter,  
>for thou hast not of the roses of Pieria;  
>but thou shalt wander obscure even in the house of Hades,  
>flitting among the shadowy dead.  

Always a useful way to slap down a barbarian (such as myself?!), which is what Shakespeare
does in the first part.  That corresponds to the "complaint" part of a Davidic Psalm,
followed by the more exalted response to ordinary music ("music of the house"):  

> Music!  Hark!  
> It is your music of the house.  
> Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.  
> Silence bestows that virtue upon it.  
>&hellip;  
> Soft stillness and the night  
> Become the touches of sweet harmony.  

[And so to bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And_So_To_Bed): with that, John Ehrlich
steps down as music director of the Spectrum Singers.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-05-19-spectrum-singers-2024-GeorgeEliot.jpg" width="286" height="289" alt="George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans)" title="George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
This was well done: even using some composers with whom I am not terribly compatible, the
Spectrum Singers (and their all-important pre-concert lecture and program notes) made me
thoughtful about spiritual meaning in a difficult world, and what role death will
eventually play for me.  

A choir that does that, of course, inevitably brings us to George Eliot's poem "The Choir
Invisible" <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, with its use of a choral metaphor as
transcendence of a mortal world, into Whitman's "different and luckier" realm:   

> Poor anxious penitence, is quick dissolv'd;  
> Its discords, quench'd by meeting harmonies,   
> Die in the large and charitable air.  
> &hellip;  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is life to come,  
> Which martyr'd men have made more glorious       
> For us who strive to follow. May I reach  
> That purest heaven, be to other souls  
> The cup of strength in some great agony,  
> Enkindle generous ardor, feed pure love,  
> Beget the smiles that have no cruelty,  
> Be the sweet presence of a good diffus'd,  
> And in diffusion ever more intense!  
> So shall I join the choir invisible  
> Whose music is the gladness of the world.

The world is difficult.  Maybe we can be "large and charitable", even in a difficult world.
