The Republicans seem to be at war with&hellip; _weather forecasting?!_  


## A Republican War on Weather Forecasting&hellip; Where Have I Heard That Before?!  

I've been seeing all sorts of _weird_ news items about Republicans getting
conspiratorially stupid about weather forecasting.  Now&hellip; where have we heard that
before?  

Oh, that's right: it was right here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR),
back on 2021-Jul-12.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

There were 2 particularly egregious cases, each surreal enough to earn a patch from 
[Dissent Pins](https://dissentpins.com/), as shown here:  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-12-really-republicans-lg-move-moon-patch.jpg" width="200" height="212" alt="Louis Gohmert: US Forest Service can move the moon" title="Louis Gohmert: US Forest Service can move the moon" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
- Representative Louis Gohmert (R-TX), often used as the reference standard for political
  stupidity, asked the US Forest Service whether they could _change the orbit of the moon_
  to fix climate change.  
  
  And then he got mad when reporting about him talking to the Bureau of Land Management
  used the abbreviation BLM, because he feared people would think he was talking to/about
  Black Lives Matter.  Because _clearly_ that's worse than thinking the US Forest Service
  can mount a space expedition to change the orbit of the moon.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-12-really-republicans-mtg-jewish-space-lasers-patch.jpg" width="200" height="212" alt="Jewish space laser shoulder patch: Goyim squad" title="Jewish space laser shoulder patch: Goyim squad" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
- The second was our old friend, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA).  She took a break
  from her usual allegations that:  
  - Democrats are satanist cannibals running a child sex ring, or that  
  - Muslims should not be allowed in public office, or that  
  - Mass shootings are staged by liberals, or that  
  - "Zionist supremacists" are causing Muslim migrations to drive whites to extinction, or that  
  - Democratic officials should be _executed._  
  
  No, no: she had more important fish to fry.  She claimed the California wildfires were
  deliberately started by PG&amp;E in conjunction with the ever-present Rothschild family,
  using _secret Jewish space laser stations,_ in order to clear a path for high-speed
  rail.  
  
  (I almost wanted that one to be true, because I could at least apply for a gig on the
  secret Jewish laser space station.  I bet the pastrami in the canteen would be really
  good.)  

## _Hw&aelig;t! We in geardagum, &thorn;rym gefrunon Republicans_

So what fell beasts do Republican heroes fight now, as did Beowulf of
old? <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

Apparently, the dark art of weather forecasting.  No doubt there are witches involved,
somewhere.  

The billionaires want to shut down government weather forecasting so they can privatize it
to make you pay them for it.  The fossil fuel oligarchs want all research on climate
change stopped and all data suppressed.  

### Weather Modification: The Latest Right-Wing Conspiracy Theory  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-newsweek-1.jpg" width="400" height="242" alt="Plummer @ Newsweek: MTG wants to outlaw 'weather modification'" title="Plummer @ Newsweek: MTG wants to outlaw 'weather modification'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-fl-ag-weather-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-fl-ag-weather-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="691" alt="Capucci: FL atty genl thinks weather modification caused TX floods" title="Capucci: FL atty genl thinks weather modification caused TX floods" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
And then there's our very special little girl, Marjorie Taylor Greene.  She apparently
thinks Democrats control the weather and keep throwing hurricanes at Republican states.
She's introduced a bill to ban the practice of weather control, called the 'Clear Skies Act'.
<sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> 

Remember back on this CLBTNR when we mentioned the [flooding in Texas]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccine-writing-hard/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20it%20appears%20the%20recent%20lethal%20flooding%20in%20Texas%20happened%20despite%20the%20Biden%20administration%E2%80%99s%20offer%20of%20money%20for%20flood%20prevention%2C%20warning%2C%20and%20mitigation.)?
And how they _refused_ flood prevention money from the Biden administration because that
was a "criminal treasonous communist government"?  And how they took some of the money
anyway, and instead of spending it on flood control spent it on sheriffs?  Well&hellip;
apparently now they've taken to thinking that the Democrats caused their flooding with
weather control, rather than taking any responsibility for their negligence of flood
control &amp; warning.  _Despite_ refusing flood control money or diverting it to cops.  

Apparently, as shown by this extract from social media, this belief has spread to the
Florida Attorney General, who thinks somebody's modifying the weather to harm him.

Greene, eager to capitalize on this, also repeats the right-wing conspiracy theory that
jet contrails are some kind of weird toxic chemical thing ("chemtrails"), instead of the
water vapor they really are.  She claims the 2024 Hurricane Katrina, which killed 224
people, was created by the then Democratic federal government.  (Her arguably equally
crazy compatriot, Gov Ron DeSantis of Florida, has also tried to outlaw weather
modification in Florida.)  

A trenchant reaction:  

> Atmospheric scientist Matthew Cappucci wrote: "It's not a political statement for me as
> a Harvard-degreed atmospheric scientist to say that elected representative Marjorie
> Taylor Green doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.  
>  
> "She'd be equally qualified to fly a Boeing-737, practice nuclear medicine or train
> zebras."  

You can read the text of her proposed bill <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, if you don't
believe me and want to mainline the crazy for yourself.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-noaa-1.jpg" width="400" height="253" alt="NOAA: No, that's all nonsense." title="NOAA: No, that's all nonsense." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been dealing with
this kind of crap for a long, tedious time.  They're _tired_ of your "chemtrail"
nonsense.  After all, if Democrats could hurl storms at red states, _why do they keep missing?!_  

Here's a debunking of those claims published back in 2024.  <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
Honestly, a trenchant summary would be, "No, all of that is crap."  But they much more
politely point out that:  
- No, the government does not create and use hurricanes as political weapons.  
- No, NOAA does not modify the weather.  
- No, [NEXRAD](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/radar/next-generation-weather-radar)
  Doppler radars do not steer hurricanes, let alone at red state communities.  
- No, there's no "solar geoengineering", whatever that would be if it existed, which it
  does not.  
- No,
  [HAARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_Active_Auroral_Research_Program#Conspiracy_theories)
  and [SCOPEX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_aerosol_injection#History)
  don't do that, either.  

Just&hellip; no.  Stop that.  Have some dignity.  

### Deeper Down the Rabbit Hole  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-pharyngula-1.jpg" width="400" height="143" alt="PZ Myers @ Pharyngula: The perils of listening to MTG" title="PZ Myers @ Pharyngula: The perils of listening to MTG" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
In fact, the seed for this whole _mishegoss_ of a blog post came from reading something by
PZ Myers at _Pharyngula._  <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  He points out that MAGA-type
people are _listening_ to Marjorie Taylor Greene's delusions, with predictably violent,
stupid, and destructive results.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-azcentral-1.jpg" width="400" height="214" alt="Ruelas @ AZCentral: anti-government group and weather radar sabotage" title="Ruelas @ AZCentral: anti-government group and weather radar sabotage" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-ok-1.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="JC Smith @ The Oklahoman: Vandalizing TV radar, who's inovolved?" title="JC Smith @ The Oklahoman: Vandalizing TV radar, who's inovolved?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-cnn-1.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="Freedman @ CNN: Militarized conspiracy against 'weather weapons' (radars)" title="Freedman @ CNN: Militarized conspiracy against 'weather weapons' (radars)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Apparently, whackos are now out to destroy weather radars.  

Our sources today come from an Arizona publication <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup> (since
the "brains" of the group comes from there, more or less), from an Oklahoma
publication <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> (since one of his minions destroyed a weather
radar power supply there), and of course CNN <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> goes into
the background a bit.  

Here's what seems to have gone down:  
- One Michael "Lewis Arthur" Meyer leads an anti-government militia-like group called
  Veterans on Patrol.  
- Meyer describes himself as a "homeless transient", who "spent time on the Arizona border
  with Mexico" apparently because he's rabidly anti-immigrant.  
- He has a history of making bizarre accusations involving child sex abuse rings and the
  ever-present "chemtrails" of right-wing delusion.  
- He now thinks that Doppler radars used for weather reporting are being used to _create_
  weaponized weather.  He thinks they are "directed energy weapons" like a "loaded weapon
  pointed at the American people."  
- He considers it "God's work" to destroy weather radars, because they are "weather
  weapons" being used by the military "in mockery of God".  
- His Telegram channel has about 6600 subscribers; he's not a 'lone gunman', to use the
  argot of other conspiracy theorists.  
- He persuaded one Anthony Tyler Mitchell to climb over a fence, destroy a weather radar
  power supply, and _then_ spray-painting the lens of a security camera.  
  - Yes, _in that order._  
  - These are not people smart enough to carry out plans that involve constraints like
    "disable the security cameras _before_ you commit a crime in front of them".  
  - Meyer described Mitchell after this crime as "a patriot".  
  
Offices of NOAA and the National Weather Service are severely short-staffed due to the
Trump administration firing most of their employees or forcing them into early
retirement. So it's hard for them to allocate extra people to security to guard their
radars against knuckleheads.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-splc-1.jpg" width="400" height="294" alt="Southern Poverty Law Center: Veterans on Patrol" title="Southern Poverty Law Center: Veterans on Patrol" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So&hellip; [who _are_ those guys?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3CxUCoDGfc)  

The _Southern Poverty Law Center_ describes Veterans on Patrol <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>
as a violent anti-government militia, with Christian nationalist aspects, hard-right
views on immigration, and encouragement of vigilante/extra-legal violence.  They have also
apparently drunk deeply at the QAnon well.  

The mix of religious fanaticism, right-wing extremism, and vigilante violence leads them
to believe they operate above the law, as fascists generally do:  

> According to VOP statements, group members believe their activities are sanctioned by
> God, and they therefore don’t have to comply with state or federal laws.  
> &hellip;  
> As an organization, VOP is designated a militia by the SPLC for its internal
> hierarchical structure, past firearm field-training exercises, and paramilitary-style
> activities its members believe are enforcing national security measures. Throughout the
> years, members have also been spotted carrying firearms while they patrol the desert for
> cartel hideout spots and for migrants crossing through the region. The group also
> engages in coordinated harassment campaigns against humanitarian and immigrants’ rights
> groups.  

Apparently they have anti-vaccine views, typical fears of child cannibalism/organ harvesting
weirdness, and a peculiarly anti-Mormon bent (link added to explain conspiracy theories around adrenochrome):  

> “Of course the Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints instruct their Members to inject
> themselves with a Bioweapon created with Aborted Fetal Matter with the technology to
> alter the Image that God imprinted on us … HIS Image. 80 million in Pfizer assets

> as Lost Sheep following their False Prophets. Satan provides this Cult plenty of wealth
> and power, and their Members do not question the Blasphemy taught by their Founder
> Joseph Smith, who was a Free Mason known for ‘Tall Tales.’” — VOP Telegram, March 20,
> 2022  

Apparently this mind-set comes with a Peculiar tendency to Capitalize Oddly.  

And of course it's all mixed with the usual Christian fundamentalist obsession with the
Book of Revelation and thinking COVID-19 vaccines alter your genes:  

> “Global currency will accompany the Mark and the world will see WEALTH being created
> instead of spiritual health being destroyed. Nearly all those who wore a mask or
> conceded to taking anti-fertility vaccinations with DNA altering nano technology created
> from unborn murdered babies in the womb will take the Mark. Americans crave wealth,
> power, and personal gain… The numbers of socialists, Marxists, and communist people
> needed to ensure Christians are overwhelmed and eventually separated from persecution
> have already poured across our border and continue to do so.” — VOP Telegram, May 20,
> 2021  

There's a _lot_ more at the SPLC site, but it's all disgusting and stupid.  They seem to
have ingested _all_ the crazy conspiracies which the American right wing now purveys
wholesale.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-pspb-1.jpg" width="400" height="193" alt="Pennycook, et al. @ PSPB: Overconfidence of conspiracy theorists" title="Pennycook, et al. @ PSPB: Overconfidence of conspiracy theorists" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

We've written before on this CLBTNR about statistical models that conclude conspiracy
organizations tend to have relatively short lifetimes <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>,
because you just can't keep secrets very well without extreme measures.  

Now from Pennycook and others at Cornell &amp; MIT comes an analysis of just _how_ some
conspiracies do survive for a while: they're so damn _certain_ of their
nonsense! <sup id="fn3a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>  

Their meta-analysis of 8 studies of a total of 4181 US adults showed conspiracy believers
consistently overestimated their performance on numeracy and perception tests, even
_after_ they learned their _actual_ performance.  There's a lot to go into in this paper,
which is worth a Journal Club on its own.  But here are some highlights:  

- They controlled for indicators of analytical thinking, need for uniqueness, and
  narcissism, but still found the overconfidence _independent_ of those other factors.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-pspb-1-fig2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-pspb-1-fig2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="311" alt="Pennycook, et al. @ PSPB: Overconfidence/belief correlation is INVERSELY related to actual truth; they overconfidently believe the weird stuff MORE" title="Pennycook, et al. @ PSPB: Overconfidence/belief correlation is INVERSELY related to actual truth; they overconfidently believe the weird stuff MORE" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Conspiracy believers had their overconfidence correlate with belief in an idea
  _even more_ when the idea itself was outlandish.  Consider their Figure 2, shown here.  
  - The horizontal axis is the "overall believability" score of a conspiracy idea, i.e.,
    the true ones are on the right.  
  - The vertical axis is the Pearson correlation between a subject's overconfidence and
    belief in a conspiracy.
  - True (proven) conspiracies are in yellow, while false ones are in green.  
  - __Conclusion:__ People who believe in conspiracy theories are even more likely to
    double down with overconfidence when their particular conspiracy theory is wildly
    unreasonable.  They believe, and over confidently so, when the idea is wildly bogus.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-pspb-1-fig3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-pspb-1-fig3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="341" alt="Pennycook, et al. @ PSPB: Conspiracy believers WILDLY overestimate the agreement of others with their ideas" title="Pennycook, et al. @ PSPB: Conspiracy believers WILDLY overestimate the agreement of others with their ideas" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Conspiracy believers massively overestimated how much others agree with them: when 12% of
  the participants agree, they thought 96% would agree.  This is illustrated in their
  Figure 4, shown here.  
  - The horizontal axis is the actual rate at which other test subjects believe a
    conspiracy theory.  
  - The vertical axis is the rate at which the conspiracy's adherents _think_ other people
    agree with them in their belief.  
  - The diagonal line is when those 2 are equal: a well-calibrated person would believe
    about other people's beliefs (vertical axis) roughly what the others think (horizontal
    axis).  If data points are _above_ this line, agreement is being overestimated.  
  - __Conclusion:__ As you can see, agreement is _wildly_ overestimated.  Conspiracy believers think that
    their beliefs are just "what everybody knows is true".  

There's a great deal more here &ndash; I haven't even _begun_ to dig into the details of
their statistical models.  But the conclusion should be clear: conspiracy believers are
wildly overconfident and think their beliefs are widely shared.  This could contribute to
their ability to keep secret due to overconfidence, or not care about secrecy because they
believe their theory is widespread.  

We've written before on this CLBTNR that excessive certainty about _anything_ is a cognitive 
injury. <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup>  Here we see it in its more florid, delusional
form.  

### The Trump Solution: Deliberate Destruction of Scientific Infrastructure  

One might hope a reasonable government would defend, well, reality here.  They could
explain how weather forecasting works, how radars are a good thing, and they could even
provide security.  

But, as Sen Markey (D-MA) reports below, they're doing the _opposite:_  

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markey.senate.gov/post/3ltzxwu4ohs2y"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-markey-1.jpg" width="550" height="868" alt="US Sen Markey: Trump demands TV stations remove equipment vital to send weather alerts" title="US Sen Markey: Trump demands TV stations remove equipment vital to send weather alerts" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

In Texas, they failed to issue warnings about the flooding.  Stung by that accusation of
failure, they propose to castrate the government by amputating its ability to send
warnings at all.  If you _can't_ send a warning, then nobody can criticize you when you
_don't_ send a warning, right?  

Of course, that's the response of destructive idiots.  

But it goes deeper: they are deliberately _destroying_ scientific infrastructure, like a
band of criminal arsonists.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-25-gop-war-on-weather-npr-1.jpg" width="400" height="191" alt="Hersher @ NPR: Deliberately destroying NASA satellites" title="Hersher @ NPR: Deliberately destroying NASA satellites" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
From a report on NPR <sup id="fn15a">[[15]](#fn15)</sup> comes news that the Trump
administration is directing NASA to de-orbit and destroy at least 2 major satellite
missions (__emphasis__ added):  

> The data the two missions collect is widely used, including by scientists, oil and gas
> companies and farmers who need detailed information about carbon dioxide and crop
> health. __They are the only two federal satellite missions that were designed and built
> specifically to monitor planet-warming greenhouse gases.__  

These are the Orbiting Carbon Observatories.  

The equipment is "state of the art and is expected to function for many more years", so
there's no point in wanton destruction of a good scientific platform _unless you don't
want scientists to be able to tell the truth about carbon dioxide in the atmosphere._  

They'd prefer to blind you about climate change, so the fossil fuel incumbents can
continue to profit without competition from cheaper green energy.  

### Deliberate Obstruction of Already-Approved Green Energy Projects  

And yet&hellip; [you fall through](https://sfshortstories.com/?p=4280) into deeper holes
yet: the deliberate obstruction of nearly-complete green energy projects.  After all, it
can't be allowed to be better than fossil fuels, or people might get the wrong idea!

In this case, the Trump administration has pulled the plug on multiple wind farms offshore
of blue states, one being very near completion. <sup id="fn16a">[[16]](#fn16)</sup>
<sup id="fn17a">[[17]](#fn17)</sup> <sup id="fn18a">[[18]](#fn18)</sup>
<sup id="fn19a">[[19]](#fn19)</sup> <sup id="fn20a">[[20]](#fn20)</sup>  

It even looks as though something like a bribe was involved, in the case of Empire Wind, _q.v._  

There are currently 5 major offshore wind power projects under construction.  Of those, 3
are under immediate attack:  
- __Empire Wind 1:__ This is a \$5 billion project under construction off the New York Coast.  
  - The commercial lease on the federal offshore area was signed in 2017-March 
    _(under the first Trump administration!)_.  
    - It was approved under the Biden administration 6 years later in 2023.  
    - Construction began in 2024.  
  - It is projected to come online in 2027, generating a whopping 810 megawatts of power.  
  - The main developer is the Norwegian company Equinor.  
- __Revolution Wind:__ This is a \$4 billion project, 80% complete, off the coast of Rhode Island.
  - Construction started in 2023.  
  - At 80% complete, it is projected to come online in 2026, generating 704 megawatts,
    400MW to Rhode Island and 304MW to Connecticut.  Apparently 70% of the turbines are
    already installed.  
  - The main developer is the Danish company &Oslash;rsted.  
- __US Wind:__ This is a project off the coast of Maryland.  
  - It was approved in 2024-Sep, at the end of the Biden administration.  So it's just getting
    started.  
  - It is projected to generate 300 megawatts of power in its initial phase, ramping up
    over time to a whopping 1,800 megawatts!  

It's clear that Trump's policy was to stop wind power, whether by propaganda, fossil fuel
subsidies, or encumbering already-issued permits and denying new ones.  From _Ars Technica_, :

> On Trump’s first day in office, the president issued a memorandum (<sup id="fn21a">[[21]](#fn21)</sup>)

The chaos monkey's antics are beginning to implement that declared policy, if only by
the creation of chaos:  
- In April, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management issued a stop-work order at Empire
  Wind 1.  
  - Their immediate excuse was that they thought the Biden administration "rushed through
    its approval without sufficient analysis."  As a reminder, it was _6 years_ from the
    signing of the offshore lease to the issue of the permit under Biden.
  - But then construction was allowed to resume in May.  The reason is about as awful as
    you might think; both the _NYT_ and _Ars Technica_ report a policy bribe
    (__emphasis__ added):  

	> In a statement to Politico’s E&E News days after the order was lifted in May, the
    > White House claimed that Hochul __“caved” and struck an agreement to allow “two natural
    > gas pipelines to advance” through New York.__  

    Gov. Hochul denies offering any such policy bribe to favored gas companies, while the
    White House crows proudly about having solicited the policy bribe, or so it appears.
    (Usually the one who took the bribe wants to keep it quiet, while the one who paid it
    complains.  Here, as with everything Trumpian, it's exactly backwards: they're _proud_
    of likely extorting fossil fuel concessions.  It's DEI for fossil fuels!)  
- In August, the Trump BOEM issued a stop-work order for Revolution Wind, even though it's
  80% complete and about to go online in less than a year.
  - The "reason", though we're stretching a point to call it that, was according to
    _Ars Technica_ (__emphasis__ added):  

	> “&hellip; the protection of __national security interests of the United States__ and prevention
	> of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas,
	> and the territorial seas.”  

  - They did not explain what the national security issues were.  But Trump's Commerce
    Department is opening an investigation, again according to _Ars Technica_:  

	> “&hellip; __the effects on the national security of imports of wind turbines__ and their
	> parts and components, &hellip;” <sup id="fn22a">[[22]](#fn22)</sup>  

	Do these numpties _actually_ think wind turbines are a national security issue?  My
    guess is no, that's just an excuse.  Speculation is that Trump is seeking to impose
    tariffs on imported wind turbine technology, and this is a way to get his hands around
    their throats to extract money.  
- US Wind in Maryland, apparently also known as "Marwind", is a much larger project, but
  at an earlier stage.  
  - However, according to Reuters, the Trump administration intends to withdraw federal
    approval.  
  - They will also, in an uncharacteristic expression of thoroughness, seek to block the
  building of the on-shore construction &amp; operations site, so it will be more
  difficult to resume construction if the appeal on the project license goes in favor of
  US Wind (as seems likely).  That's&hellip; _vindictive:_ if you can't deny them a
  license, then destroy their ability to construct anything on land.  

It's not _all_ about the oceans, though.  The _NYT_ article also mentions that Trump is attempting
to reverse approval of the Lava Ridge Wind Project in southern Idaho, for alleged
unspecified "legal deficiencies."  And Trump's Department of Energy has issued an order
compelling a coal-burning power plant in Michigan to continue running.  

Apparently intimidation works. From the _NYT:_  

> In the wake of Mr. Trump’s election, some companies have said they will halt plans to
> develop any more offshore wind projects in the country for the foreseeable future.  

From _Ars Technica:_  

> “The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the US is no longer a reliable place for
> long-term energy investments,” said the American Clean Power Association, a trade
> association, in a statement on Friday.  

You can have all the opinions you want about wind, but it's still there, still green,
still abundant in power, and _every other developed nation in the world knows this._ You
can think otherwise, if you insist delusion.  But &ndash; to continue the theme of
impending marine disaster &ndash; it's getting late, and the Lorelei still sings to lure
us to die with fossil fuels:  

> Die Luft ist kühl und es dunkelt,  
> Und ruhig fließt der Rhein;  
> &ndash; Heinrich Heine, ["Die Lorelei"](https://oxfordsong.org/song/die-lorelei)


## The Weekend Conclusion  

So there you have it:  
- the war on weather to privatize &amp; sell the weather information with the army of
  psychotics on their domestic terrorism campaign against scientific instruments,  
- the sequestration of data &amp; outright destruction of instruments that might point a
  finger at fossil fuels &amp; climate change, and  
- the impoundment of funding &amp; withdrawal of permits on late-stage energy projects, so
  they will never come to fruition without a major bribe to the fossil fuel oligarchs.  

As Trump repeatedly demonstrates: he might be personally too stupid and impulsive to carry
out a plan correctly, but he _will_ cause immense damage along the way.  Those
manipulating him are counting on that destruction.  

As we've remarked earlier on this CLBTNR <sup id="fn23a">[[23]](#fn23)</sup>, it is much
easier to destroy than it is to create.  When the fanatics of the Robespierre period of
the French Revolution executed scientist Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier on 1794-May-08, the 
French mathematical deity Joseph-Louis Lagrange remarked:  

> It took them only an instant to cut off that head, but France may not produce another
> like it in a century.It took them only an instant to cut off that head, but France may
> not produce another like it in a century.  

So it is today with Trump in the role of Robespierre, destroying what took most of a
century to build: our scientific infrastructure, our soft power in the world, and now our
near-future energy infrastructure.

As you can see here, the Weekend Publisher disapproves.  

Actually he disapproves of more or less everything.  But he _especially_ disapproves of
right-wing destruction of public goods like science in particular, and of the destruction
of civilization in general.  

He's a cat of great and good taste.  

He's an
[anglophone &amp; francophone cat]({{ site.baseurl }}/misbranding-chatgpt-french/#so-what-about-chatgpt),
but if he knew Latin, he'd approve of this CLBTNR's regrettably necessary motto:  

[_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/ceterum-censeo/)
