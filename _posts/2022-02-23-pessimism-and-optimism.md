[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) why I'm always so dour.
Well, times are hard: pandemic waves, disinformation and death, potentially nuclear
war over Ukraine, the rise of the fascist right, and so on.  So let's take some
inventory of our problems&hellip; and maybe a few points that (may) cause hope for the future.  


## The Bad News: 6 Reasons to Despair  

Ok, fair question: why _am_ I so dour these days?  Well, lifelong clinical depression and
becoming an old man probably have something to do with it.  But&hellip; so does the state
of the world.  

To wit, 6 reasons chosen _ad libitum_ from recent news:

### Reason 1: The collapse of&hellip; everything&hellip; into fascism  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-nyt-brooks.jpg" width="400" height="223" alt="Brooks @ NYT: The Dark Century" title="Brooks @ NYT: The Dark Century" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
If we're going to inventory reasons for despair, why not start with a conservative
columnist?  Conservatives are, after all, the cause of most of my despair.  As I've
mentioned a couple times now, I have relatively little patience with 
[David Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brooks_(commentator)) in general.  He's
a bit too willing to forgive Republican madness in the name of
[St Edmund Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke), _way_ too willing to perpetrate
deeply misleading both-sider-ism, and so on.  (He is, however, rather good in very small
doses, rather like pepper, with a chaser/antidote of
[Jonathan Capehart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Capehart) on the
[PBS News Hour](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/) (as he was with former
colleague/counterbalance [Mark Shields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Shields)).  

He has a recent column in the _New York Times_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> in which
I believe he recognizes our collective symptoms world-wide (though his prescription for
treatment is wishful thinking):

> In the early 1990s I was a roving correspondent for _The Wall Street Journal_, based in
> Europe. Some years it felt as if all I did was cover good news: the end of the Soviet
> Union, Ukrainians voting for independence, German reunification, the spread of democracy
> across Eastern Europe, Mandela coming out of prison and the end of apartheid, the Oslo
> peace process that seemed to bring stability to the Middle East.  
>  
> I obsess about those years now. I obsess about them because the good times did not
> last. History is reverting toward barbarism. We have an authoritarian strongman in
> Russia threatening to invade his neighbor, an increasingly authoritarian China waging
> genocide on its people and threatening Taiwan, cyberattacks undermining the world order,
> democracy in retreat worldwide, thuggish populists across the West undermining nations
> from within.  
>  
> What the hell happened?  

Yes: "what the hell happened?" is indeed the correct question, with especial emphasis on
the use of the word "hell" as the theologically correct description of our collective
illness.  Well done, Brooks: we don't agree on much, but I'm with you on this one.  

He goes on to describe this as the collapse of "the liberal order", using 'liberal' in a
certain technically correct poli sci sense, but possibly gleefully hoping people will
mistake for liberal social policies.  He follows that by an appeal for return to
traditions that people abandoned once they had a viable choice to do so.  The collapse,
though, is in fact the collapse of
[_neolilberalism_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism), which has not much to do
with the 'liberal' policies favored by that grizzled old socialist, your humble Weekend
Editor.  

Still&hellip; _something_ big is collapsing dangerously into fascism.  To ignore this with
a sunny optimism is just delusional on the scale of
[_Candide_ and Professor Pangloss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide).  

### Reason 2: The furious frustration of the majority liberal voters  

Next, let's have a look at [_FiveThirtyEight_](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), founded by
[Nate Silver](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/nate-silver/) to fill the need for
objective [data journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism) on politics.
(And, inexplicably to me, sportsball kinds of stuff, too.  _De gustibus,_ and all that.)
I like to read them to get a take on _what the data says_, not what some half-educated
pundit thinks.  I was gleeful in the last few elections to see they correctly predicted
more states and even counties than the seasoned pundits!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-538.jpg" width="400" height="248" alt="FiveThirtyEight: Why are white liberals so pessimistic?" title="FiveThirtyEight: Why are white liberals so pessimistic?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
And so, an article by [Daniel Cox](https://www.aei.org/profile/daniel-a-cox/) on why white
liberals like me are pessimistic and pissed off. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  At
first blush, I don't quite see why anbody needs this article, because isn't it _obvious?_
But then, I'm a white liberal, so perhaps it's a case of fish not perceiving the water in
which they swim.  

Interestingly, Cox runs the
[American Enterprise Institute's Survey Center on American Life](https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/emerging-trends-and-enduring-patterns-in-american-family-life/).
Now, the AEI is such a far-right nuthouse that I would never even think to read it.  So if
they have something credible to say that passes muster with my brother and sister
statisticians at _FiveThirtyEight_&hellip; maybe I should pay attention.  Thus here we
are.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-538-barplot.jpg" width="400" height="204" alt="Cox @ 538: White Democrats more worried" title="Cox @ 538: White Democrats more worried" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
His first [Deep Thought](https://www.pinterest.com/chrissymfrey/deep-thoughts-snl/) is
that only half of Americans are optimistic.  Given the general shape of the world as it
is, this is like saying only half of Americans are even vaguely rational: the real
question is why the other half are so delusional?  

Now, he doesn't publish his data, so we can't check for ourselves, but: looking at that
barplot above, do you think the difference is statistically significant?  It seems like a
medium-sized effect at best, and the lack of a $p$-value raises my hackles a bit.
Still&hellip; this is _FiveThirtyEight_, which is full of people like me who probably
asked that question and wouldn't publish it without a positive answer.  I hope.  

Oddly, he asserts American society has moved to the left in recent decades.  _That_
strikes me as straight-up right-wing delusion: we're _far_ more conservative than we used
to be, and downright crazy about it.  True, more _voters_ identify with liberal policies.
But Republicans have manipulated unrepresentative features of our government
(gerrymandering, voter suppression, unrepresentative Senate, packed Supreme Court) to
perpetuate their minority rule.  Americans may be more liberal, but American _government_
is sliding into fascism.  But then, this is the AEI we're listening to, so it makes sense
he would assert that.  

Like his fellow conservative David Brooks, he says he thinks liberals aren't religious
enough or engaged in civic groups enough, like conservatives.  Pfeh.  

His next critique is that liberals consume more political media, and that's making us
depressed, pessimistic, and anxious. Which is just&hellip; okay, pretty fair point
there.  He feels this acts on liberals in a way that "warps
our perception of the world".  Which is just&hellip; the sort of mulish name-calling one
expects from conservatives, though it's a surprise to find it in _FiveThirtyEight_.  

But what's the solution?  Ignorance of politics sounds like a suicidal course.  A packed
Supreme Court, an unrepresentative Senate, gerrymandering, voter suppression laws, and
proudly ignorant loudmouths wherever you look&hellip; this things do not inspire
confidence for democracy.  

I came away from this one disappointed: not much insight to be gained here, and precious
little data to back up the promising title.  

### Reason 3: Red COVID  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-nyt-leonhardt-1.jpg" width="400" height="513" alt="Leonhardt @ NYT: Red America's COVID Problem" title="Leonhardt @ NYT: Red America's COVID Problem" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

David Leonhardt at the _New York Times_ continues his series, which 
[we've previously cited]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot-a-sixth-time/#the-vaccine-defiance-stupidity-is-nakedly-partisan), 
on the 'Red COVID' phenomenon of lower vaccination rates and higher deaths in Republican areas.
<sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup><sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup><sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>

Last week there was a sobering update on both the total deaths by political affiliation in
the US, as well as trailing 30 day death rates:  
- The first plot shows cumulative death rates per 100,000, binned by county % of votes for
  Trump.  
  - There was an initial blue wave in early 2020, as the coastal Democratic cities were
    hit.  They have more contact with the outside world than the decidedly insular,
    borderline xenophobic cities of the interior, so it makes sense the pandemic would hit
    them first.  
  - Then the coastal cities got a grip, with masking, social distancing, and
    eventually vaccinating.  The red areas did much less of that, and paid with their
    lives.  
- The bottom plot shows the same sort of information, this time as a death _rate_ per
  100,000.  (Basically the first plot is the time integral of this one.)  
  - We see the same inital blue wave as the pandemic hit the coastal Democratic cities.  
  - We then see the same, depressing cycle of waves in Republican areas where people
    _refuse_ to mask, to distance, or to vaccinate.  They cannot refuse to die.  
    
[Schadenfreude pie](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2006/09/26/how-to-make-a-schadenfreude-pie/)
is a shameful taste to acquire, but it feels as though the world is forcing this upon
those of us who survive.  

### Reason 4: Republican vaccine defiance  

Charles Gaba, the very persistent data journalist behind _ACASignups_, has updated his
plot of vaccination rates versus Trump voting, which we've previously cited multiple
times.  This time, he's constructded an animation showing just how rapidly things got
worse in the red counties over a full year since the vaccines first became 
available. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  

![Charles Gaba @ ACASignups: animation over time of vax status vs county Trump lean]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-acasignups-gaba-red-blue-county-animation.gif "Charles Gaba @ ACASignups: animation over time of vax status vs county Trump lean")

The most interesting thing to me about this animation is something Gaba also is at pains
to point out:  

> As I've been noting for awhile now, the most telling thing about this is how there was
> virtually no partisan gap in the first couple of months (February & March), when only
> seniors, healthcare workers and certain immunocompromised & other select groups were
> eligible to get vaccinated.  

The early days of vaccination were desperate times, and those most at risk reached out to
get shot.  (Your humble Weekend Editor and Editrix, as junior senior citizens, were among
them.)  But as soon as we dipped into the general population, the knuckleheads began to
scream against vaccinations, for reasons ranging from superstition to insanity.  As [Derek
Lowe, the formidable med-chem blogger at _In the Pipeline_ at
_Science Translational Medicine_ put it](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/usefulness-rebuttal):  

> The vaccines, I am informed by passionate people with degrees from Twitter State
> University, are making the coronavirus strains worse, turning vaccinated people into
> destructive super-spreaders, making them far more likely to die from the next variant,
> giving them ADE, making them sterile, giving them heart attacks, giving them cancer,
> destroying their immune systems, giving them HIV outright, rearranging their DNA,
> rearranging it so that their DNA is now covered under evil Pharma patents and they are
> now thus owned by drug companies, rearranging it so that they are now technically
> another species entirely, targeting this particular ethnic group over here, deliberately
> sparing this particular ethnic group over there, filling everyone’s bodies full of
> tracking devices, filling them full of alien nanotech micro-bots, filling them full of
> 5G antennas, filling them full of aborted fetal cells, filling them full of Satanic
> messages and portraits of Bill Gates and trial memberships for Amazon Prime and God
> knows what else.  

It's _hard_ not to be gloomy about the future in the face of furious ignorance from
conservatives like that.  And it's not like they're a minority; since Reagan the
Republican party has migrated rightward and crazy-ward until now it looks like they're
almost _all_ like that.  

Should you have the grave misfortune to find yourself inadvertently Republican, you have
my sympathy. And my advice: get out of the crazy party.  

### Reason 5: Vaccines miracles, disinfromation curses  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-stat-branswell.jpg" width="400" height="202" alt="Branswell @ STAT News: COVID-19 vaccines miracles" title="Branswell @ STAT News: COVID-19 vaccines miracles" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The redoubtable Helen Branswell, writing at _STAT News_ catalogs some of the ways in which
the COVID-19 vaccines have been exactly what we mean by 
miraculous <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>:  
- Record efficacy at 90% and above, developed in record-shattering time.  Just go back and
  read some of the early posts on this crummy little blog that nobody reads (CLBTNR), and you'll
  see me gushing about that too ([here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pfizer-vaccine-efficacy-data/), 
  [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/moderna-vaccine-efficacy-data/), 
  [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/beautiful-vaccines/),
  [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/pfizer-vaccine-passes-vrbpac-review/), 
  [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/beautiful-vaccines-2/),
  [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/moderna-vaccine-passes-vrbpac-review/),).  Well done, vaccine
  makers.  
- Also, in a bit under 1 year, we've managed to _vaccinate 55% of the entire human species!_
  Yes: we haven't done it equitably, we've done it too slowly to prevent variants, and so
  on.  We'll eventually do the right thing there (after, in the alleged words of
  Winston Churchill, "exhausting all possible alternatives").  
- Vaccination has saved millions of lives, just in the US; many more world-wide.  
- We had a solid foundation in mRNA research, just poised to bear fruit at the exact
  moment it was needed.  "Miracle" is, if anything, an understatement here.  
- Branswell closes by quoting Ana Durbin, director of the Center for Immunization Research
  at Johns Hopkins:  
  > We’ve demonstrated that, given the resources, you can develop, evaluate, produce, and
  > distribute a totally novel vaccine to hundreds of millions, if not billions of people,
  > given a huge effort and extensive financial resources.  

So why aren't we all celebrating in the streets, with smiles all around?  Good job, right?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-wapo.jpg" width="400" height="90" alt="Editorial Board @ WaPo: How many did vax misinformation kill?" title="Editorial Board @ WaPo: How many did vax misinformation kill?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Well&hellip; sort of.  

As the _Washington Post_ editorial board pointed out yesterday <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>,
while we have miraculous vaccines, we labor under the self-inflicted curse of
disinformation.  People just _cannot_ stop saying stupid stuff about vaccines even when it
costs lives.  If you were to tell me the anti-vax disinformation campaign were found to be
an act of terrorism by a hostile foreign power, I would of course want to see evidence,
but I would be favorably disposed toward this explanation.  

They start by quoting Helen Branswell ("freaking miracle").  But then:  
- 5% of people think the vaccines contain microchips (but see Dr. Pip 
  [previously in this CLBTNR]({{ site.baseurl }}/variants-vs-vaccines/#what-about-vaccine-resistance))  
- 7% thought the vaccines use aborted fetal cells  
- 8% thought the vaccines could alter human DNA  
- 10% thought the vaccines could cause infertility.  
- 46% were "uncertain" about at least one of the preceding 4 lies.  

On the Republican propaganda channel Fox News, Tucker Carlson apparently compared vaccine
mandates to the Nazi medical experiment/torture acts of Nazi Germany, on Jan 21, according
to the _WaPo_.  Somehow, Republicans trust _that_ more than they trust vaccination!  

Hence&hellip; a gloomy outlook.  We cannot long survive with that sort of information
sewage pumped at high pressure into the minds of half of US citizens.  

### Reason 6: Racist violence from police  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-dumb-racist-cop.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-dumb-racist-cop-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="447" alt="Audrey Nickel @ Geeky Gaeilgeoir: Dumb racist cop hilariously self-owns in Irish Gaelic mistranslation" title="Audrey Nickel @ Geeky Gaeilgeoir: Dumb racist cop hilariously self-owns in Irish Gaelic mistranslation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Look, we're a racist country.  Just get over it.  Then set about fixing it.  

Unfortunately, in the meantime, we have to deal with our police forces as they currently
exist.  They have a regrettable tendency to be right-wing white supermacists.  The number
of pointless beatings and murders of Black Americans is distressing, of course, but
nothing new.  It's just that we now have video on our phones so we capture it.  That's why
cops so doggedly resist the right of the public to video them while on duty: it makes it
much harder to cover up later.

With their hysterical opposition to the  Black Lives Matter movement, cops sometimes like
to counter that "Blue Lives Matter", meaning they think they're the real victims here.  As
a great many of them, for inscrutable reasons, hew to a few bits of Irish culture, it was
inevitable that they would try to translate that into Irish Gaelic, as shown on the shirt
worn by this poor unfortunate.  

The _Geeky Gaeilgeoir_ goes through why _everything_ about this is
wrong. <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>  In an attempt to translate "Blue Lives Matter"
into Irish, mistakes were made in _every single word_, with hilarious result:  
1. The words are not even vaguely in the Gaelic order, which is VSO: verb, subject,
   then object.  (Your humble Weekend Editor, while innocent of Irish Gaelic, once knew a
   little Scottish Gaelic.)  
2. To say something "is important" is a whole different phrase; our dumb cop here chose
   the word for the _noun_ matter, as in material objects like dirt, water, and air.  
3. Instead of the word "lives" (with a long I), he chose the verb "lives" as in "is
   alive".  The Gaelic equivalent would have been something like the word for "people".  
4. Well, _gorm_ does mean blue.  But when referring to people, colors usually mean _hair_
   color, not skin color! This could be people with blue hair, except&hellip; it's an
   indirect and polite way to refer to Blacks.  

So even if you spot the racist jerk a few points for grammar, word order, and incorrect
use of the dictionary&hellip; he ended up almost saying "Black Lives Matter"!  

The fact that I have to reach this far to find something funny is symptomatic of just how
dark the times are.  We're being taken down by people who are not just racists and
violent, but who are _this stupid._  

And we haven't even _started_ in on climate change, that may kill billions in the
generations to come.  If you're a boomer like your humble Weekend Editor and are puzzled
why the millennials seem mad at you, this is why.  In their place, I'd be mad at us too.
(I vs Us??  Counterfactual subjunctives and pronominal reference don't play well together in
English!  Do they do any better in any other languages?)  

## The Good News: 6 Reasons to Hope  

Many of the Davidic Psalms in the Hebrew Bible start out as lamentations.  At a crucial
point in the middle, they pivot to thanksgiving for anticipated forgiveness and
redemption.  So it is here, or at least we shall attempt to be so.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-wapo-takei.jpg" width="400" height="494" alt="George Takei @ WaPo: Without optimism, we have already failed" title="George Takei @ WaPo: Without optimism, we have already failed" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Actor George Takei seems to be a decent fellow.  Once when appointed to a transportation
board in California (more or less based on celebrity), he actually went out and learned
about transportation issues, so he could be _competent._  He's more than just an actor,
he's a pretty smart and decent guy.  

He's also old enough, and 3rd generation Japanese-American, to have been in one of the
WWII internment camps during one of America's xenophobic periods.  KK Ottersen recently interviewed
him about those memories (and his graphic novel on the subject) in the
_Washington Post._<sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>  

There are many aspects to the interview, both cruel and beautiful.  One bit that
particularly stuck with me was this one:  

> You know, my father said resilience is not all just teeth-gritting determination. It's
> also the strength to find and see beauty in an ugly situation. To be able to find joy,
> make our joy, behind barbed wires and all these people wallowing in their misery.  

So his father started baseball teams.  And dance groups in the evening, with a  record
player in the mess hall.  And they produced musicals.  All of that, in a prison camp in
their own country.  

_That's_ resilience: the ability to find the bits of beauty amongst the misery.  

Let us attempt resilience.  

### Reason 1: The COVID-19 Omicron wave is finally fading  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-mwra-omicron-wanes.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-mwra-omicron-wanes-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="306" alt="Mass Water Resources Authority 2022-Feb-18: Biobot data says omicron wave is waning" title="Mass Water Resources Authority 2022-Feb-18: Biobot data says omicron wave is waning" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
From the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority's measurement of SARS-CoV2 mRNA in Boston
metro wastewater <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup> comes evidence that the Omicron wave
is finally ending.  As you can see from the plot, the wastewater levels of viral mRNA are
almost back down to baseline.  

As we discovered in
[our last analysis of this data for the Omicron wave]({{ site.baseurl }}/wastewater-reredux/#wave-3-omicron),
cases follow this signal about 7 days later, and deaths about 19 days later.  Roughly, we
can expect that by about 2022-Mar-15, we can expect the COVID-19 death rate to decrease
back to baseline.  

Until another variant pops up, that will constitute at least a temporary reprieve for the
vaccinated.  (The unvaccinated, of course, might as well paint targets on their backs and
carry signs saying "Infect me!")  

So while the pandemic is _definitely_ not over in Boston (or in the US), we might look
forward to a reprieve in about 3 weeks.  

That will be&hellip; _welcome._  

### Reason 2: mRNA HIV vaccine trials  

Remember in
[2020-Nov](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/pfizer-vaccine-efficacy-data/#why-thats-all-wrong)
when we predicted this whole mRNA business would revolutionize vaccine research &amp;
development?  Remember back in [2021-Aug](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/two-predictions/#revolutionizing-vaccines-of-the-future)
when we confirmed that picture with the hints that an HIV vaccine trial would soon start
from Moderna?  

No?  That's ok, we don't really remember either and had to look it up.

But it's true: the HIV mRNA vaccine trial has finally started dosing people in Phase I,
according to press releases from the International AIDS Vaccine 
Institute <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  
and Moderna. <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>  The clinical trial is 
NCT05001373, also known as IAVI G002 <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup>, available for
your perusal at _ClincalTrials.gov_.  

It uses a 60-mer of mRNA, and in some arms assesses a boosting immunogen (usually called
an adjuvant?) to induce maturation of memory B cells and the production of broadly
neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs).  Given how fast the HIV virus can mutate, the ability to
retarget the mRNA in almost real time will probably prove important.  

It looks like a fairly complex design for a Phase I, with various arms getting the
origianl vaccine, the original vaccine plus the boosting immunogen/adjuvant, and some
getting just the boost immunogen/adjuvant.  

We wish them luck!  It's time for AIDS to go.  

### Reason 3: Poking a hibernating bear with a cancer immunotherapy stick

Med-chemist and blogger Derek Lowe at _In the Pipeline_ has some fascinating 
news <sup id="fn15a">[[15]](#fn15)</sup> 
of a paper <sup id="fn16a">[[16]](#fn16)</sup> on the
interaction of cancer PD-1 therapies and latent/hidden HIV virus in people taking
maintenance therapy for AIDS.  

The paper is, alas, paywalled; but Lowe's description is fascinating:  
- PD-1 ("programmable death receptor 1") is a gene now at the focus of many innovative
  immunotherapies in cancer.  
  - It basically calms down T cells, stopping them from killing things.  
  - Some tumors take advantage of this by expressing PD-L1 on their surfaces, which then
    binds to PD-1 and tells T cells not to kill the tumor.  
  - So of course there are now multiple therapies for blocking PD-1 so T cells can see
    tumors properly and kill them.  
  - There is also a _lot_ of interest in combination therapies, to discover what other
    drugs pair well with PD-1 inhibitors.  
- AIDS is a complicated disease caused by the complicated virus HIV.  
  - When HIV is active, it pretty much kills off the immune system, including the T
    cells.  
  - Modern therapies can combat active HIV pretty well, but HIV is sneaky: it can hide
    somewhere (not completely understood) and come back later when the drugs are
    withdrawn.  
  - This means people have to stay on anti-HIV drugs for the rest of their lives.  
  
The paper comes with the interesting discovery: some forms of PD-1 cancer therapies, for
reasons not really understood, tease out the latent HIV virus and make it come out to go
on the attack against the immune system.  

Lowe compares this to poking a hibernating bear with a stick: if all you've got is a
stick, this is a _bad idea._  But if you have a shotgun loaded for bear, and for some
reason you need to kill a bear, then this can work.  

And so it is here: we have therapies that work against active HIV, and now we have a PD-1
therapy that (sometimes) turns latent HIV into active HIV where we can fight it.  

This discovery hinged on having patients who have both AIDS and a PD-1-appropriate cancer,
which is bad luck squared.  Let's all be thankful for these afflicted folk who
participated in a clinical trial and may have led to a life-saving discovery.  

If this works out, adding a PD-1 inhibitor to the AIDS cocktail of drugs would force the
remaining virus out in the open where it can be attacked&hellip; and possibly _cure_ the
disease.  

So that's 2 good bits on AIDS: prevention and treatment.  

### Reason 4: White paint.  Yes, white paint. VERY white paint.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-white-paint-paper.jpg" width="400" height="134" alt="Li, et al. @ Appl Matl &amp; Interfaces: Ultrawhite BaSO4 paint for subambient radiative cooling" title="Li, et al. @ Appl Matl &amp; Interfaces: Ultrawhite BaSO4 paint for subambient radiative cooling" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
What's so interesting about white paint?  

Well, if it's _really_ white, it reflects a lot of solar energy.  For example, if you
could paint roofs really, _really_ white you could reflect a lot of sun back into space,
and even make a meaningful impact on climate change.  

Can we do that?  Apparently we can, now.  

I originally stumbled across this story via a PBS NewsHour report <sup id="fn17a">[[17]](#fn17)</sup>,
which led to a Purdue Univesity press release <sup id="fn18a">[[18]](#fn18)</sup>,
which pointed at a patent <sup id="fn19a">[[19]](#fn19)</sup>, and finally led to the 
paper (paywalled, but somebody sent me a copy) <sup id="fn20a">[[20]](#fn20)</sup>.  

Basically Ruan and colleagues at Purdue have discovered a very highly reflective white
paint, based on BaSO4 with a distribution of particle sizes tuned to the blackbody
radiation of the sun.  It reflects most solar energy, and what it emits in infrared it
emits in the sky window that gets out through the atmosphere without being reflected back
to earth.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-white-paint-paper-temps.jpg"> <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-white-paint-paper-temps-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="148" alt="Li, et al. Fig 3: field tests showing reduction of temperature vs ambient" title="Li, et al. Fig 3: field tests showing reduction of temperature vs ambient" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The result is that it stays about 4.5&deg;C below ambient temperature and achieves a
cooling power of about 117 W/m2, as shown here in their Figure 3 (click to embiggen).
That's enough, if painted on the roof of a building, to 
take up a substantial portion of the air conditioning load.  If many roofs in an area are
thus painted, the average temperature goes down.  They calculate that 1% of the earth's
surface being this relfective would be enough to stop global climate change.  

Barium sulfate is nontoxic (used in make-up and even internally in intestinal imaging),
and its mining is more eco-friendly than the current white paint pigments.  

This could be big.  And it's _simple_, so it can be done in the developing world, too.  

### Reason 5: Food production  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-food-lowe.jpg" width="400" height="112" alt="Lowe @ In the Pipeline: Lose a methyl group, gain food production" title="Lowe @ In the Pipeline: Lose a methyl group, gain food production" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-food-nat-biotech.jpg" width="400" height="259" alt="Yu, et al. @ Nat Biotech: RNA demethylation and potato/rice production" title="Yu, et al. @ Nat Biotech: RNA demethylation and potato/rice production" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Plants are a genetic nightmare: huge genomes, unimaginably complex biochemistry, making
molecules the size of battleships&hellip; _very_ different from animals, or fungi, or
bacteria, or archaea!  So every time we try to monkey with their genome to increase food
or oil or fiber production, lots of stuff has to be consideered.  

Derek Lowe, again at _In the Pipeline_, reports <sup id="fn21a">[[21]](#fn21)</sup> a
novel paper <sup id="fn22a">[[22]](#fn22)</sup> (behind a regrettable paywall) on messing
with RNA methylation in certain food plants.  
- N6-methyladenosine is one of many epigenetic markers (basically a Sharpie making marks on the
  genome to note which genes should be on or off in each tissue) found almost everywhere.  
- Humans have a [gene called FTO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTO_gene) that
  demethylates N6-methyladenosine, in a way that plants do not.  
- So what happens if you put the human FTO gene in potatoes and rice?  Interesting stuff,
  that's what!  
  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-food-potatoes.jpg" width="400" height="172" alt="Higher yield potatoes with transgenic RNA demethylation gene FTO" title="Higher yield potatoes with transgenic RNA demethylation gene FTO" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Here are some potatoes grown with and without the extra FTO gene.  See howmuch larger they
are on the right?  The result was that crop yields in rice and potatoes went up by 50%
with the insertion of FTO.  In rice, grain size remained constant as did overall plant
size; they just produced a _lot more grains of rice._  In the potatoes above, the overall
number of potatoes is about the same, but the overall weight of potatoes skyrocketed.  In
both potatoes and rice, nutritional quality (starge, protein, total carbohydrate, vitamin
C content) remained about the same.  

Basically FTO made deeper and more extensive roots, and boosted photosynthetic efficiency
up "by a startling 36%", in Lowe's words.  Transpiration from leaves (basically plant
breathing) was up 78%, but drought tolerance was also improved.  These are 
_exactly the traits we want to see in a world of hostile climate change._  

Of course there will be hysterical, superstitious resistance to what will probably be
called "Frankenstein potatoes".  But it's better than letting the world starve.  (Of
course, I thought vaccination was better than letting people die.  We know how _that_ worked
out.)  

### Reason 6: Near(er) term fusion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-cfs.jpg" width="400" height="418" alt="Commonwealth Fusion Systems: 40 Tesla REBCO magnet" title="Commonwealth Fusion Systems: 40 Tesla REBCO magnet" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WdoI1X5m96s" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yXLO3-7BRwQ" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
We've [written about this previously]({{ site.baseurl }}/cfs-20t-magnet/), but it bears
repeating.  Fusion power has been "20 years in the future" for the last 50 years, by most
scientist's reckoning.  There's a bit of "boy who cried wolf" to fusion stories for that
reason.  

But&hellip; there's been some real progress.  Commonwealth Fusion Systems, here in the
Weekend Fiefdom of New England, reported building a 20 Tesla superconducting 
magnet <sup id="fn23a">[[23]](#fn23)</sup>, which is A Big Deal.  (I remember as an
undergrad back in the 1970s being impressed with a pretty gnarly 1 Tesla magnet.)  

They're building a tokamak architecture they call ARC ("affordable, robust, compact", but
we really know it's the ARC reactor built by Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man and another MIT
graduate like the CFS folks).  Their prototype SPARC ("smallest possible ARC") is being
built now in Massachusetts, expected to produce commercially meaningful power by 2025.  

This changes _everything._  Not only can we decarbonize our entire energy infrastructure
and eliminate fossil fuels, but we can also:
- Build desalinization plants to supply coastal cities with water.  No longer will LA use
  most of the water in various rivers, contributing to the desertification of the
  southwest.  The impact on the developing world could be life-saving.  
- Localized power with vertical farming technology mean that food production can happen at
  scale, almost anywhere.
- &hellip; and a ton of other applications dependent on compact, localized, clean power.  


## The Weekend Conclusion: 12 Reasons to be Confused  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-02-23-pessimisim-and-optimism-dickens.jpg" width="400" height="216" alt="Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities: The best of times, the worst of times" title="Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities: The best of times, the worst of times" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Best let [the best author](https://dickens.ucsc.edu/programs/dickens-to-go/best-of-times.html)
have the (nearly) last word:  

> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was
> the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it
> was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it
> was the winter of despair.  &mdash; Charles Dickens, _A Tale of Two Cities_  

So shall we go against our natural grain and be optimists?  Or shall we be pessimists and
depressed forever?  It's a difficult choice for me.  

I was recently impressed by an essay of Jason Crawford at
_Less Wrong_ <sup id="fn24a">[[24]](#fn24)</sup> on the subject of what exactly optimism
and pessimism mean.  He distinguishes:  
- _Descriptive optimisim:_ Believing that good things will naturally happen.  This is the
  view of the maddening Professor Pangloss: "this is the best of all possible worlds."
  I'm normally a pretty peaceful guy but that sort of thing makes me want to punch
  Professor Pangloss.  Good thing he's a fictional character, no?  
- _Prescriptive optimism:_ A belief that we can and should do all that we can to make
  better outcomes.  To match Professor Pangloss with a dueling adage: "we work to make
  this world much, much better."  
  
Descriptive optimists make me want to punch the delusional, a desire which I work to
suppress.  Prescriptive optimists make me want to ask what the work is that needs to be
done.  

In fancier language: [Romain Rollard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_Rolland),
French writer &amp; Nobel Laureate, reviewing
[Raymond Lefebvre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Lefebvre)'s
_The Sacrifice of Abraham_ (quoted by DJ Fisher: <sup id="fn25a">[[25]](#fn25)</sup>):  

> this intimate alliance &ndash; which for me makes the true man &ndash; of __pessimism of the intelligence, which penetrates every illusion, and optimism of the will.__ It is this natural bravery that is the flower of a good people, which __"does not need to hope to undertake and to succeed to persevere,"__ but which lives in struggle over and above suffering, doubt, and the blasts of nothingness because his fiery life is the negation of death.  

When simultaneously confronted with optimism and pessimism, my personal position is closer
to that of one of my favorite authors,
[James Branch Cabell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Branch_Cabell) who thus satirizes 
Professor Pangloss:  

> The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds; and the pessimist fears this is true.  &mdash; [_The Silver Stallion_, Book 4, "Coth at Purutsa", Ch XXVI: The Realist in Defeat](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/James_Branch_Cabell#The_Silver_Stallion_(1926))
