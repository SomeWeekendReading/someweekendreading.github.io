MIT is famous for having&hellip; _unusual_ works of art on its campus.  They've recently
managed to surprise even jaded old me.  


## "Gaze to the Stars"

There's lots of art around the MIT campus, some of which comes in for hilarious criticism
from the undergrads.  

Louise Nevelson's ["Transparent Horizon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_Horizon) 
was a particular favorite target of theirs, back in the day:  
- I've seen it bombed with paint balloons.  
- I've seen it with chairs welded to it.  
- I've even seen it buried in snow, which is remarkable given it's over 20 feet tall.  (I
  wondered, that year, if they'd go under the snow with cutting torches and take it out
  piece by piece&hellip; until the spring melt revealed it was gone.  Fortunately, cooler
  heads prevailed.  That one time, anyway.)

So it was with some interest that I noted an article from WBUR, a local NPR station, on
MIT art projects <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> with an arresting opening sentence:  

> It's not everyday that you look up and see a 75-foot eye.  

Umm&hellip; yes, that's true; not that I thought I'd ever need to be told that.

But it turns out that Behnaz Farahi, the director of MIT Media Lab’s Critical Matter
Group, and a group of 11 students have taken video of eyes and projected them onto the
Great Dome.  This is a giant dome in Building 10, at one end of the Great Court that abuts
Memorial Drive.  The project is called "Gaze to the Stars".  Apparently when people
volunteered to get video taken of their eyes, they were supposed to whisper secrets to an
AI.  (Which, to my mind, ups the creepiness factor immensely.)  

I'm kind of surprised a 75 foot eye on the Great Dome hasn't caused traffic accidents on
Memorial Drive, where traffic is ordinarily frighteningly fast!  Gawking while driving
would not be a good idea.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-03-19-eye-of-sauron-at-mit-sauron-1.jpg" width="100" height="220" alt="Eye of Sauron" title="Eye of Sauron" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Oh, no.  No-no-no.  This does _not_ resemble the Eye of Sauron.  Not in any way, shape or form.
Nuh-uh.  No, sir/ma'am/nonbinary.  Not in the least bit.  

In fact, we MIT folk do _not_ believe in making rings of power, let alone giving
them to fascists.  We're just little techno-hobbitses, we are.  Trying to make the world
better, one [_tikkun olam_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam) step at a time.  

Now, for _some_ kinds of powerful rings, we can do stuff for you.  Want a proton synchrotron with a
$p\bar{p}$ storage ring?  Hook you right up.  

As long as you're not some demonic whatsit from another dimension.
