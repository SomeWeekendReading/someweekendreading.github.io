Well&hellip; are we?  


## What does it take?  

Look, I know we're all tired of COVID-19.  (If you're _not_ tired of it, then you're not
paying attention.  Good luck with that.)  Are we close to the end, or not?  And what does
"the end" even mean?  

It seems pretty clear now that we won't be rid of COVID-19 any time soon: the SARS-CoV2
virus is too well-established in animal reservoirs all over the 
world. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  Since we have contact with those animals, there
_will be_ zo&ouml;notic transfer for approximately forever, until either humans or the
virus change.  It'll likely be the virus, but I have no idea of the time scale.  

As we saw in [the previous post on this crummy littel blog that nobody reads]({{ site.baseurl }}/natural-immunity-persistence/),
just hoping for 'natural' immunity means getting COVID-19 about every 18 months until
dead.  So the only feasible pathway forward is vaccination with periodic boosters.  

How's _that_ going?  


## Vaccination progress

Not so great, actually.  

Yesterday in the _New York Times_ was a report that nations who were early leaders in
vaccination are now laggards. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

Of immediate and striking interest to your humble Weekend Editor was the accompanying
picture, shown here: an anti-vax rally in New York City in 2021-Sep, with closely packed
people none of whom are masked!  Sit with those facts for a minute: they _won't_ get
vaccinated, they _won't_ social distance, and they _won't_ mask.  Consequence: they _will_
get COVID-19.  

This is why the pandemic drags on.  People refuse to take the safe, free, easily available
routes to safety.  Today 57% of the US population is fully vaccinated.  For comparison
purposes Portual has 87%.  Keep in mind that the Delta variant of SARS-CoV2 has an $R_0
\sim 6.0 - 7.0$ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, that means herd immunity happens when
the immune fraction $h$ is:  

$$
h = 1 - \frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - \frac{1}{6.0 \mbox{ to } 7.0} = 83.3\% \mbox{ to } 85.7\%
$$

So Portugal has likely achieved herd immunity, barring even more virulent strains.  The US
at 57% is nowhere near that, despite starting earlier with vaccination.  It appears we can't
count on 'natural' immunity from people who have recovered from COVID-19, since that fades
enough by 18 months to be a problem.  

Now, it's not uniform in the US.  The miserable American South has remained mired in a
political swamp of ivermectin and Republican propaganda.  The northeast has been pretty
ok, but the best standout has been Puerto Rico with 73%, better even than New England.
CNN reports that they are the most heavily vaccinated US
region. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> So congratulations to sensible Puerto Ricans,
along with
[Native Americans, who are the most vaccinated US ethnic group]({{ site.baseurl }}/highest-vax-group-in-us/)!  

Why aren't the rest of us as good as them?  Basically: superstitious vaccine resistance.  

From the _NYT_ article:

Think about that: "people's willingness to be vaccinated" is the only barrier.  

As Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus of the WHO put it:

## The Weekend Conclusion  

It ends when we choose to end it.  You have the capability; will you use it?
