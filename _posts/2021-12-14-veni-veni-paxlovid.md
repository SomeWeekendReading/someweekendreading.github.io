Today Pfizer announced they've submitted the final data package to the FDA for their
COVID-19 anti-viral oral therapy, paxlovid.  Wanna take a look at the (scant) data we have
so far, as a holiday gift of sorts to all of humanity?  


## Paxlovid on the precipice  

Ok, why is everybody so tightly wound around the axle on the subject of Pfizer's paxlovid?  

- It's an oral drug (pills) that looked in an early analysis of part of its clinical trial
  like it reduced COVID-19 hospitalization by 89% if given early enough.  
- That could be big news for treating both the superstitious vaccine resisters and the
  vaccinated who get breakthrough infections.   
- It could also be utterly game-changing if the safety data is good, since it could be
  used prophylactically to the contacts and family of an infected person, given enough
  testing and tracing.  (We're still 
  [working on high-availability testing](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/weekend-editrix-exposed/)
  here in the US.)  

But&hellip; we thought these ame thing about Merck's molnupiravir, but the efficacy
basically fell through the floor (i.e.,
[went _negative_](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/efficacies-dont-average/#))
when the data was completed, and had major safety concerns with mutagenicity and breeding
new variants.  

So we're either going to get all our dreams of holiday gifts to come true here, or have
the fantasy balloon of COVID-19 treatment popped painfully.  

Which is it?  


## The paxlovid data package submitted to the FDA this morning  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-14-veni-veni-paxlovid-biopharma-dive.jpg" width="400" height="267" alt="Fidler @ BioPharma Dive: Pfizer final analysis of paxlovid is still good" title="Fidler @ BioPharma Dive: Pfizer final analysis of paxlovid is still good" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
This afternoon in my email was something from _BioPharma Dive_.  (Yeah, I was slumming.
You caught me.  In my defense, _LinkedIn_ thought this was "appropriate" for me and began
emailing it to me; being a lazy slug I haven't bothered to figure out how to turn it off
yet.)  But since I was anxious to see paxlovid move along toward approval, so people can
_stop_ moving along toward death, my eye was caught by a title that contained the words
"Pfizer", "COVID-19 pill", "final analysis", and "effective". <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

Yep, it apears the data package for paxlovid has been submitted to the FDA.  In the comments at [TheZvi](https://thezvi.wordpress.com), I had opined that [if it were submitted by last Friday, then with perfect scheduling and nobody playing "Joe Manchin at the FDA", we might get Emergency Use Authorization by the end of this year](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2021/12/06/omicron-post-4/#comment-16123).  Well, we didn't make last Friday, but we made today, a slip of 4 days.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-14-veni-veni-paxlovid-pfizer.jpg" width="400"
height="196" alt="Pfizer: Paxlovid full study results confirm robust efficacy vs COVID-19 hospitalization" title="Pfizer: Paxlovid full study results confirm robust efficacy vs COVID-19 hospitalization" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Our next stop is the primary source: the Pfizer press release from 6:45am 
today <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, saying that the data package was delivered to the
FDA and one or two coy facts about the good news contained therein.  Keep in mind this is
a press release, where Everything Must Be Good News.  Here at Chez Weekend, we are always
and invariably deeply and darkly suspicious of press releases.  When we can see the actual
data package and, more importantly, the independent FDA analysis of it, then we'll really
know what's what.  This is _preliminary!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-14-veni-veni-paxlovid-stat.jpg" width="400" height="161" alt="Herper @ STAT: Paxlovid still 89% effective in final analysis" title="Herper @ STAT: Paxlovid still 89% effective in final analysis" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I also decided to check out _STAT News_, where Helen Branswell and Matthew Herper have
been keeping me sane (sort of) the last couple months.   It turned out that Herper got the
gig here, and wrote a summary. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-14-veni-veni-paxlovid-in-the-pipeline.jpg" width="400" height="256" alt="Derek Lowe @ In the Pipeline: Pfizer's paxlovid holds up" title="Derek Lowe @ In the Pipeline: Pfizer's paxlovid holds up" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Also, the formidable med-chem blogger Derek Lowe weighed in at 
_In the Pipeline_. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

It really looks like we're all reading the same press release, and coming to the same
conclusions.  At least we agree about what it _says_, even though we wish it said _more_
(like a link to the actual data package!).  


## Yeah, fine.  But what's in it?  

Good question.  

Nobody outside Pfizer and the FDA have seen it yet.  I just checked
[the calendar of the FDA advisory committees](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar),
and paxlovid is not there yet.  Keep in mind the FDA just got the data either last night
or this morning, so they're a little busy right now and won't surface even for a pizza
until at least sometime tonight.  They won't know for some days if they have a similarly
reanalyzed result that will justify an AMDAC meeting.  

Also keep in mind that [AstraZeneca's evusheld was approved _without an external advisory committee meeting!_](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/fda-evusheld/)
The FDA just said, more or less, "Looks right to us.  Good job.  EUA." and that was that.
They don't _always_ need an external committee to tell them what to do.  

So that means we're working from the Pfizer press release, and a couple news reports by
reporters whose only source is that same press release.  As I said, _preliminary_.  We'll
have to wait for the FDA to emerge from its pyramid with The Official Word, but at least
the clock is ticktocking on that now.  I imagine anybody who works on this at the FDA is
_painfully_ aware of this.  


## Ok&hellip; if you must.  What's in the press release?  

Here's what I got out of the sources below:  

1. __Efficacy:__ The fear we all had that this would be another molnupiravir, fizzling out
   in both efficacy and safety, did not happen.  
   - The interim analysis said 89% efficacy against hospitalization, and the final
     efficacy said 88%, i.e., no statistically significant change.  
   - There was 89% efficacy if given within 3 days of symptoms, and 88% within 5 days, so
     the window of opportunity to treat is not as narrow as feared.  
   - Risk reduction (I _think_ they mean the efficacy, but RR is another specific
     technical term, so I need the actual package to know what this means) in those over
     age 65 was a stunning 94%, i.e., _higher_ in the population of high medical need.  
2. __The numbers and their confidence limits:__ 28 days after treatment, there were 5/679
   patients in the treatment arm hospitalized, versus 44/682 in the control arm.  That
   gives us a central estimate of the efficacy of: $1 - (5/679) / (44/682) = 88.6\%$.  So
   their report is consistent.  

   Using the Weekend Reading [R script](https://www.r-project.org) for estimating efficacy
   confidence limits with a scaled binomial model <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>, we get 
   a respectable very confidence limit of 72.3% &ndash; 95.3%:  

   ```R
   > signif(efficacyAndCL(679, 5, 682, 44), digits = 3)
	 LCL   Eff   UCL 
   0.723 0.886 0.953 
   ```
   
   Also, there were 0 deaths in the treatment arm vs 12 in the placebo arm.  So before
   anybody tries to bust my chops about "100% efficacy vs death", let's get the confidence
   limits on that, where we see a not too wildly indecisive 68% &ndash; 100% (confidence
   limits on rare events are always wide, because you can't get enough samples; since
   each sample is a death, this is a good thing):  
   
   ```R
   > signif(efficacyAndCL(679, 0, 682, 12), digits = 3)
	LCL  Eff  UCL 
   0.68 1.00 1.00 
   ```
3. __Viral load:__ It reduced viral load in the treatment arm vs placebo arm by a large
   fold ratio: 0.93 log10 copies/ml, which in the vernacular is a 10-fold reduction.  

   Translation: "ginormous".  The drug is working by a mechanism of action (reduction in
   viral load) that is right down at the root cause of the disease.  It's _extremely_
   difficult ot argue that the drug is not doing what it looks like it's doing, namely
   curing COVID-19.  
4. __Side effects:__  There are always side-effects, sometimes unpleasant, sometimes
   even fatal.  The side effects here were described as "mild".  (But remember: this is a press
   release, so they _would_ say that, wouldn't they?)  

   More to the point is whether side effects were so strong as to get people to drop out
   of the trial: 2% dropout in the treatment arm, vs 4.2% in the placebo arm.  The
   treatment arm experienced fewer or milder side-effects (enough to make people drop out)
   than the placebo.  Always love to see that.  
5. __Vaccinated vs unvaccinated:__ In vaccinated subjects, it was less good at reducing
   symptoms, but still reduced hospitalization by 70%. Now there are more vaccinated these
   days, so 70% of a larger number, as Zvi pointed out, might mean more than the
   percentage reveals, though the vaccinated are at lower risk overall.  
   
   There will be animated discussion on this, both by the FDA wondering for whom it should
   be described, as well as nimrods who think it means they can shirk vaccination.  Though
   if the safety profile is good, an unrestrictive prescription profile would make sense.  
6. __Variants:__ In the trial it worked against several variants (quantitative data
   pending), and lab tests indicated efficacy against Omicron (inhibits the same viral
   protease essential to viral reproduction).  
   
   This is _in vitro_ data, not actual combat usage against COVID-19 patients in the
   wild.  So it could change, but at least it points in the hopeful direction.  It's
   _possible_ Omicron could mutate its [3CLpro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3C-like_protease)
   protease to escape paxlovid.  But at least for now, Omicron has only 1 mutation there
   ([P132H in ORF1ab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant#Mutations)), 
   which is not (yet) enough.  
   
   There will likely be robust discussion at the FDA regarding the tradeoff between wide
   use of paxlovid vs selection pressure to mutate 3CLpro to escape paxlovid.  I don't
   personally know anything like enough about how to make that trade-off, and just hope
   that people who _do_ know discuss it at the hearings.  
   
   Resistance to paxlovid is another incentive to try combination therapy, since it's
   dramatically harder to mutate to evade simultaneously 2 drugs with different
   mechanisms.  Maybe with molnupiravir, if that ever gets approved; maybe with
   fluvoxamine; maybe with monoclonal antibodies; maybe&hellip; maybe.  
7. __Availability:__ US government has bought 10 million courses of treatment for \\$5.3bln
   (\\$530/course of treatment, _cheaper_ than molnupiravir?!). Pfizer claims 200,000
   courses available this year, and 80 million next year. Given that there are only 17
   days remaining in this year and it’s not yet approved, that’s impressive.  

   Though as Zvi pointed out, 200k doses might be a single day's worth by the end of the
   year.  Then again, if it gets approved Dec 30, that works out for the 1 remaining day
   of the year.  Not in a good way&hellip; but it _does_ work out.  

   Still, I'm betting on a narrower FDA Emergency Use Authorization.  The risk of
   ritonavir interacting with other drugs is high (though known, so physicians have to
   _check_ before prescribing), and the more widely an antiviral (or, for that matter,
   antibacterial) is used the more likely resistance mutations happen.  So probably it's
   going into the highest-risk populations first.  

   Using it in combination with something else with a different mechanism of action would
   somewhat de-risk the situation as far as paxlovid escape mutations go.  
8. __Dosing:__ Dosing would be 2 pills of nirmatrelvir and 1 of ritonavir, twice a day.  

   It's a combination medication: nirmatrelvir is Pfizer's new inhibitor of a SARS-CoV2
   protease, and ritonavir helps it along.  Ritonavir is also a protease inhibitor in its
   own right, but its main role here is to inhibit the liver mechanisms that would break
   down nirmatrelvir, thus making it last longer in the body.  
   
   Ritonavir is a well-known drug, used chronically by those with HIV to inhibit the HIV
   proteases.  That's pretty good news: we know a lot about the safety of HIV meds, and
   it's moslty good.  (_Mostly:_ because ritonavir slows the breakdown of other drugs, it
   interacts with a _lot_ of other medications, and therefore warrants a cautious doctor
   looking down your medication list.  Some may need to have increased doses, others
   decreased doses, others temporarily substituted wit another drug.) 
   
   We can hope for reasonably free use here if we take those precautions, maybe?  

## The Weekend Conclusion  

Ok, that's more or less it: 
- The FDA has yet to act on Merck's molnupiravir, 2 weeks after the narrow AMDAC vote in
  favor of it.  Britain has authorized it <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, but France
  rejected it. <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  
- Paxlovid is moving along.  Everything looks good so far, from what little is available.  
- On the other hand, what's available is from a relatively slim press release.  (I haven't
  dug into clinicaltrials.gov to see if there's an official report there yet.)  

So&hellip; things could change.  

US deaths from COVID-19 are just around 800,000.  Now the FDA has the next move.
Tick, tock&hellip; tick, tock&hellip; tick, tock&hellip;  


## Addendum 2021-Dec-16: Looks like the Europeans got there first&hellip; sort of  

This week the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had a meeting of its Committee for Medicinal
Products for Human Use (CHMP), and they advised that paxlovid can begin to be used in
Europe (according to a Pfizer press release). <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup> The EMA is
(sort of) like the US FDA, and the CHMP is a bit like several of the FDA advisory
committees (AMBAC, VRBPAC in this case).  

They authorized it under European regulations which are (again, sort of) like the
Emergency Use Authorization in the US, i.e., it's not fully authorized and it's up to the
medical authorities of the member states to decide to allow it on an emergency basis.  So
lots of political Rube Goldberg machinery has to wheeze into action&hellip; but at least
it's _action._  

They advised it for patients who (a) do not yet need supplementary oxygen and (b) have
other risk factors for the disease, and that it should be administered within 5 days of
symptoms.  So, as predicted above, they wrote for it somewhat narrowly.  They hedged a bit
on "adults at standard risk", but said it was being studied.  

Apparently the fact that paxlovid showed _in vitro_ activity against Omicron was of some
interest, as is completely understandable given the steep trajectory of Omicron.  


## Addendum 2021-Dec-21: Rumor has FDA approval this week?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-14-veni-veni-paxlovid-reuters.jpg" width="400" height="155" alt="Reuters: Anonymous reports on FDA approving molnupiravir &amp; paxlovid this week" title="Reuters: Anonymous reports on FDA approving molnupiravir &amp; paxlovid this week" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
_Reuters_ reported just this morning essentially a rumor that molnupiravir and paxlovid
will be "approved" (presumably under EUA?) this week, "according to people familiar with
the matter". <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> Or, apparently at least "three of the
people", who asked not to be named.  It looks like Wednesday (tomorrow!) would be the
earliest this can happen.  

I _hate_ anonymous stories like this.  We can't check anything!  And there's nothing on
the FDA's AMDAC and VRBPAC committee meeting calendars, so it would have to be an approval
without the external advisory committee, like
[evusheld](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/fda-evusheld/).  That's somewhat rare, but
it can happen.  Maybe the paxlovid data is good enough to warrant this; molnupiravir looks
like a hot mess right now.  A sense of urgency, I guess.  

Still&hellip; maybe tomorrow will be A Good Day.  

"The FDA declined to comment."
