(US-centric post.) We've finally gotten Social Security beneifts turned on and
straightened out.  Also, Medicare.  It was _not_ easy!  


## Turning 65: Medicare, and Spousal Medicare  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-28-soc-sec-journey-medicare-logo.jpg" width="400" height="125" alt="Medicare logo: senior healthcare in the US" title="Medicare logo: senior healthcare in the US" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I retired shortly after turning 65.  My newly-former employer put me on "retiree health
care", which meant I applied for Medicare and the employer supplied a supplement
(essentially Plan G, but Massachusetts is different) and Part D (prescriptions).  My
spouse stayed on their regular insurance, though now we had to pay the lofty premium.

This was ok: the plan was to keep corporate retiree insurance until she turned 65 and
could apply for Medicare.  I didn't want to risk getting her an Obamacare policy, since
that was under perpetual attack by Republicans, and we wanted something they couldn't
destroy.  

Then my employer switched strategies, and forced it upon their retirees: Medicare
Advantage.  This is private insurance, cheaper for my employer, which replaces Medicare.
It was a nightmare: nickel-and-dime for everything, and I even had trouble getting them to
pay for a COVID-19 booster!  (I had to go to 3 separate pharmacies before someone would
listen to my explanation that Medicare Advantage was Part C, so they had to look in a
different place.  It took _an hour_ to get them to figure that out!)

But we held on, so that my spouse could continue with the guaranteed-issue corporate
insurance.  

When she turned 65:
- I immediately terminated the corporate insurance, and switched for myself to Original
  Medicare and a Plan G-like supplement (Massachusetts Plan 1A; Mass simplified away all
  the traps of various sorts that happen in other states), and a Part D drug supplement.
  Worked like a charm.  
- We tried to get my spouse, a Japanese national here in the US as a permanent resident on
  a green card, on Medicare.  
  - First, someone declared she was ineligible because she was a foreigner.  This required
    escalation to a Social Security manager to resolve.  
  - Second, they claimed she didn't have the 40 quarters of work credits required.  She
    did, but just barely and they hadn't processed the previous year's tax returns
    properly.  
  - Third, they'd have to "investigate".  We supplied marriage certificates (along with US
    Consulate-certified translations), tax returns showing married filing jointly, and the
    deed to our house showing joint ownership in a trust.  Also, we swore under oath that
    we were married.  
  - That _finally_ worked, but she had no obvious insurance for a couple months in
    mid-pandemic.  Social Security/Medicare swore it was retroactive, but I wouldn't want
    to go to a hospital with the promise of retroactive insurance that _might_ be granted
    in the future!  

That got us both on Original Medicare (without the hostile supervision from private
insurance companies), and Massachusetts-certified supplements that we knew would work,
since the state government had weeded out the bad actors and marginal players.

So far, so good: but it took _months_ of back-and-forth and maybe 4 visits to the
(fortunately nearby) Social Security office, with the stress of unclear insurance.  


## Turning 70: Social Security Benefits  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-28-soc-sec-journey-ssa-logo.jpg" width="400" height="385" alt="Social Security logo: senior retirement benefits in the US" title="Social Security logo: senior retirement benefits in the US" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
In the US, you can claim benefits as early as 62, though the benefit will be lower.  My
"full retirement age" would have been 66 and 2 months.  But&hellip; if I delayed until age
70, the benefits went up by 8%/year.  That's a good deal for an inflation-adjusted
annuity, so that's what we did.  

(Some people want to game the system by taking it early or late based on perceived life
expectancy.  But it's actuarially neutral.  There's no point in delaying past 70, but we
_did_ want to get benefits flowing before Trump and DOGE burned it to the ground.  Also, we
waited to age 70, not trying to maximize money: Social Security is not an investment; it's
_insurance._  It insures against the possibility of getting very old and being broke
because the portfolio's been depleted.  We want to maximize that insurance.)  

1. __Years ago:__ We established on-line Social Security accounts, verifying our identities. 
   - Actually, these had been in place for years already.  If you don't have one, you
     should make one, assuming you're an American who will one day be eligible.  
   - We used their software to estimate our benefits, with my payments based on my work
	 record and spousal benefits (half my benefit at full retirement age) for my spouse.  It
     looked like a very comfortable inflation-adjusted annuity.
2. __December 2024:__ Seeing the spectre of Trump on the horizon, we applied in December of 2024.  We
   specified on the form:
   - My benefits to start in a few months, when I turned 70.  We did not want the "lump
     sum" benefit of several months that they usually try, since that would lower lifetime
     benefits.  
   - The Weekend Editrix's application specified the same date, and specifically asked for
     benefits not on her own record, but the larger spousal benefit instead.  
3. __March 2025:__ And that's where things sat.  And sat.  And sat.  Our application was always "under
   consideration", but no evidence of motion.  Finally in March 2025, both applications
   were "Approved"!  But&hellip; her benefit was on her own record, not spousal benefits!
   - There's no way to email them.  There's no way to submit feedback on the site.  No
     walk-in appointments at the (thankfully nearby!) Social Security office were permitted.
     So&hellip; we called the national number, which was the only thing permitted.
   - Each call kept us on hold for 2-4 hours.
   - Inquiring about benefits asked us a bunch of questions, and then _dropped the call_
     with no way to recover.
   - That happened 3 times in a row.
   - Asking for an agent _without_ specifying the problem put us in line.  When we got the
     callback, she said she had to "look up some stuff", and dropped the call.
   - Finally we got to talk to an agent.  I thought there was this thing called 
     ["deemed filing"](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/claiming.html#:~:text=Deemed%20filing%20means%20that%20when%20you%20file%20for%20either%20your%20retirement%20or%20your%20spouse%E2%80%99s%20benefit%2C%20you%20are%20required%20or%20%E2%80%9Cdeemed%E2%80%9D%20to%20file%20for%20the%20other%20benefit%20as%20well.), where if you apply for benefits you're 'deemed' to have applied for spousal
     benefits, and you get the larger one.  
   - Agent said no, that doesn't happen, there's no way to do that on the web site, it
     requires an interview, and no, he can't do the interview. 
   - So we set up an appointment for an interview, the closest appointment being 2 months
     in the future.
   - As it happened, the Weekend Editrix was going to be in Japan at that time.  So we scheduled
     a call at 3am Japan time.  
4. __April 2025:__ They were an hour late, but showed up finally.  I was conferenced in by
     the mechanism of an Internet voice call, with the volume dialed up so the agent could
     hear both of us.  Like almost all the Social Security people, he was polite,
     efficient, and even pleasant.  I was prepared to present all sorts of documents
     saying we're married, but he just said it was enough for us to swear it to him over
     the phone, under penalty of perjury.  
5. __May 2025:__ The payments started showing up:  
   - I got my full payment, minus the Medicare Part B premium.  
   - I also got a credit for the previous month's Medicare Part B, which they had _both_
     withheld _and_ drawn from my checking.  So they caught that one and properly fixed it,
     without my having to get after them.  (They're actually pretty good at this, just
     near-impossible to contact.)  
   - The Weekend Editrix got a "true-up" payment to bring April's payment up to spousal
     benefit levels, and the correct spousal payment for May.  
   - We also filled out a W-4V form (voluntary withholding), to tell the Feds to take 22%
     of our Social Security as tax payments.  It was hard to figure out how to send this
     in, and I had the super-duper secret number for the local office, so we called.
     After a 45 minute wait, the agent said  no need to mail them because he could do it
     for us over the phone.
6. __June 2025:__ Watching the payments to our bank accounts, it finally looks correct:
   the correct benefits (my own record and her spousal record), deducting Medicare Part B
   premia, and deducting taxes.  
   - A minor oddity: they deduct the Medicare Part A premium _first_, and then taxes
     _second_.  It's as though the Part A premium is tax-free, which it is not.  That is,
     they paid:
	 
     $$
     \mbox{Payment} = (1 - 0.22) \times (\mbox{Benefit} - \mbox{Part A premium})
	 $$
	 
	 instead of:
	 
	 $$
     \mbox{Payment} = (1 - 0.22) \times \mbox{Benefit} - \mbox{Part A premium}
	 $$

     It's a small thing, so I'm just gonna step back and leave that one alone!  


So it took 7 months to get everything processed through, verifying identity, marriage, &amp;
eligibility, getting spousal benefits, and getting taxes taken out.  

It was _exhausting!_  Also, worrisome.  But&hellip; for now, it's _done._  


## The Road(s) Not Taken   

There used to be all sorts of games you could play, involving switching back and forth
between your own record and spousal record payments.  Most of those loopholes have been
closed.  

One thing we _could_ have done was have the Weekend Editrix apply for benefits on her own
record when she reached age 67.  Then, a few months later when I turned 70, she could have
switched to spousal benefits when I applied.  That would have gotten us about 3-4 months
of a lower benefit, then trade up to our current benefits.  

But&hellip; when you see how hard it was to apply in a straightforward way, you can, I
hope, understand why we had no appetite to touch the system any more than we had to.

Looks like it's all sorted out, for now.  We'll keep watching the bank accounts to make
sure it _stays_ that way, so long as Trump is in office.  We don't want to be victims
unawares, of Republican mischief.  

As you can see, the Weekend Publisher and the Assistant Weekend Publisher remain
unconcerned.  It is difficult to disturb the Zen-like aplomb of well-loved cats.  

I shall continue to attempt to imitate them, contemplating the serene peace of the Weekend
Editrix's beautiful hillside shade gardens.  

And, of course, write about the descent of the US government into naked criminality.  At
my age, I'm a bit frustrated that this is just about _all_ I can do.

Nope.
