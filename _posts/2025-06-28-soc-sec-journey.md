(US-centric post.) We've finally gotten Social Security beneifts turned on and
straightened out.  Also, Medicare.  It was _not_ easy!  


## Turning 65: Medicare, and Spousal Medicare  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-28-soc-sec-journey-medicare-logo.jpg" width="400" height="125" alt="Medicare logo: senior healthcare in the US" title="Medicare logo: senior healthcare in the US" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I retired shortly after turning 65.  My newly-former employer put me on "retiree health
care", which meant I applied for Medicare and the employer supplied a supplement
(essentially Plan G, but Massachusetts is different) and Part D (prescriptions).  My
spouse stayed on their regular insurance, though now we had to pay the lofty premium.

This was ok: the plan was to keep corporate retiree insurance until she turned 65 and
could apply for Medicare.  I didn't want to risk getting her an Obamacare policy, since
that was under perpetual attack by Republicans, and we wanted something they couldn't
destroy.  

Then my employer switched strategies, and forced it upon their retirees: Medicare
Advantage.  This is private insurance, cheaper for my employer, which replaces Medicare.
It was a nightmare: nickel-and-dime for everything, and I even had trouble getting them to
pay for a COVID-19 booster!  (I had to go to 3 separate pharmacies before someone would
listen to my explanation that Medicare Advantage was Part C, so they had to look in a
different place.  It took _an hour_ to get them to figure that out!)

But we held on, so that my spouse could continue with the guaranteed-issue corporate
insurance.  

When she turned 65:
- I immediately terminated the corporate insurance, and switched myself to Original
  Medicare and a Plan G-like supplement (Massachusetts Plan 1A; Mass simplified away all
  the traps of various sorts that happen in other states), and a Part D drug supplement.
  Worked like a charm.  
- We tried to get my spouse, a Japanese national here in the US as a permanent resident on
  a green card, on Medicare.  
  - First, someone declared she was ineligible because she was a foreigner.  This required
    escalation to a Social Security manager to resolve.  
  - Second, they claimed she didn't have the 40 quarters of work credits required.  She
    did, but just barely, and they hadn't processed the previous year's tax returns
    yet to see that.  Also, she could get Medicare by _right_, since she was married to me.  
  - Third, they'd have to "investigate".  We supplied marriage certificates (along with US
    Consulate-certified translations), tax returns showing married filing jointly, and the
    deed to our house showing joint ownership in a trust.  Even my US passport and
    original, raised-seal birth certificate, just to not miss a trick.  Also, we swore
    under oath that we were married.  
  - That _finally_ worked, but only after she went without any obvious health insurance
    for a couple months in mid-pandemic.  Social Security/Medicare folk swore it was
    retroactive, but I wouldn't want to go to a hospital with the promise of retroactive
    insurance that _might_ be granted in the future!  

That got us both on Original Medicare (without the hostile supervision from a private
insurance company), and Massachusetts-certified supplements that we knew would work,
since the state government had weeded out the bad actors and marginal players.

So far, so good: but it took _months_ of back-and-forth and maybe 4 visits to the
(fortunately nearby) Social Security office, with the stress of unclear insurance during a
pandemic.  


## Turning 70: Social Security Benefits  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-28-soc-sec-journey-ssa-logo.jpg" width="400" height="385" alt="Social Security logo: senior retirement benefits in the US" title="Social Security logo: senior retirement benefits in the US" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
In the US, you can claim benefits as early as 62, though the benefit will be lower.  My
"full retirement age" would have been 66 and 2 months.  But&hellip; if I delayed until age
70, the benefits went up by 8%/year.  That's a good deal for an inflation-adjusted
annuity, so that's what we did.  

(Some people want to game the system by taking it early or late based on perceived life
expectancy.  But it's actuarially neutral, so all that matters is the _difference_ between
your life expectancy and the population average.  There's no point in delaying past 70, but we
_did_ want to get benefits flowing before Trump and DOGE burned it to the ground.  So, we
waited to age 70, not trying to maximize money: Social Security is not an investment; it's
_insurance._  It insures against the possibility of getting very old and being broke
because the portfolio's been depleted.  We want to maximize that insurance.)  

1. __Years ago:__ We established on-line Social Security accounts, verifying our identities. 
   - Actually, these had been in place for years already.  If you don't have one, you
     should make one, assuming you're an American who will one day be eligible.  
   - We used their software to estimate our benefits, with my payments based on my work
	 record and spousal benefits (half my benefit at full retirement age) for my spouse.  It
     looked like a very comfortable inflation-adjusted annuity.
2. __December 2024:__ Seeing the spectre of Trump on the horizon, we applied in December of 2024.  We
   specified on the form:
   - My benefits to start in a few months, when I turned 70.  We did not want the "lump
     sum" benefit of several months that they usually try, since that would lower lifetime
     benefits.  
   - The Weekend Editrix's application specified the same date, and specifically asked for
     benefits not on her own record, but the larger spousal benefit instead.  
3. __March 2025:__ And that's where things sat.  And sat.  And sat.  Our application was always "under
   consideration", but no evidence of motion.  Finally in March 2025 (the month benefits
   were supposed to start!), both applications
   were "Approved".  But&hellip; her benefit was on her own record, not spousal benefits!
   - There's no way to email them.  There's no way to submit feedback on the web site.  No
     walk-in appointments at the (thankfully nearby!) Social Security office were permitted.
     So&hellip; we called the national number, which was the only thing permitted.
     - Each call kept us on hold for 2-4 hours.
     - Inquiring about benefits asked us a bunch of questions, and then _dropped the call_
       with no way to recover.
     - That happened 3 times in a row.
     - Asking for an agent _without_ specifying the problem put us in line.  When we got the
       callback, she said she had to "look up some stuff", and dropped the call.
   - Finally we got to talk to an agent.  I thought there was this thing called 
     ["deemed filing"](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/claiming.html#:~:text=Deemed%20filing%20means%20that%20when%20you%20file%20for%20either%20your%20retirement%20or%20your%20spouse%E2%80%99s%20benefit%2C%20you%20are%20required%20or%20%E2%80%9Cdeemed%E2%80%9D%20to%20file%20for%20the%20other%20benefit%20as%20well.), where if you apply for benefits you're 'deemed' to have applied for spousal
     benefits, and you get the larger one.  
     - Agent said no, that doesn't happen, there's no way to do that on the web site, it
       doesn't matter we said so on the application "because the computer doesn't read
       that", it requires an interview, and no, he can't do the interview.  Well&hellip;
       _that_ was helpful!  
     - So we set up an appointment for an interview, the closest appointment being 2 months
       in the future.  
     - As it happened, the Weekend Editrix was going to be in Japan at that time.  So we scheduled
       an international call at 3am Japan time.  (Thank heaven our US phones work in
       Japan!  iPhones with T-Mobile over-55 everything-unlimited plan, if you want to know.)
4. __April 2025:__ The call came an hour late, but finally happened.  I was conferenced in by
     the mechanism of a simultaneous Internet voice call on another device, with the
     volume dialed up so the agent could hear both of us on the phone.  Like almost all
     the Social Security people, he was polite, efficient, and even pleasant.  I was
     prepared to present all sorts of documents saying we're married, but he just said it
     was enough for us to swear it to him over the phone (under penalty of perjury, of course).  
5. __May 2025:__ The corrected payments started showing up:  
   - I got my full payment, minus the Medicare Part B premium.  
   - I also got a credit for the previous month's Medicare Part B, which they had _both_
     withheld from my Social Security benefit _and_ drawn from my checking.  So they
     caught that one and properly fixed it,
     without my having to get after them.  (They're actually pretty good at this, just
     near-impossible to contact.)  
   - The Weekend Editrix got a "true-up" payment to bring April's payment up to spousal
     benefit levels, and the correct spousal payment for May.  
   - We also filled out a couple W-4V forms (voluntary withholding), to tell the Feds to take 22%
     of our Social Security as tax payments.  It was hard to figure out how to send this
     in, but I had the super-duper secret number for the local office, so we called.
     After a 45 minute wait, the agent said  no need to mail them because he could do it
     for us over the phone.  Which he then did, quickly, efficiently, politely, and
     pleasantly.  
6. __June 2025:__ Watching the payments to our bank accounts, it finally looks correct:
   the correct benefits (my own record and her spousal record), deducting Medicare Part B
   premia, and deducting taxes.  
   - A minor oddity: they deduct the Medicare Part B premium _first_, and then taxes
     _second_.  It's as though the Part B premium is tax-free, which it is not.  That is,
     they paid:
	 
     $$
     \mbox{Payment} = (1 - 0.22) \times (\mbox{Benefit} - \mbox{Part B premium})
	 $$
	 
	 instead of:
	 
	 $$
     \mbox{Payment} = (1 - 0.22) \times \mbox{Benefit} - \mbox{Part B premium}
	 $$

     It's a small thing, so I'm just gonna step back and leave that one alone!  

So it took 7 months to get everything processed through, verifying identity, marriage, &amp;
eligibility, getting spousal benefits, and getting Medicare Part B premia &amp; taxes taken out.  

It was _exhausting!_  Also, worrisome.  But&hellip; for now, it's _done:_ we have pensions
flowing and good health insurance in force.  


## The Road(s) Not Taken   

There used to be all sorts of games you could play, involving switching back and forth
between your own record and spousal record payments.  Most of those loopholes have been
closed.  

One thing we _could_ have done was have the Weekend Editrix apply for benefits on her own
record when she reached age 67.  Then, a few months later when I turned 70, she could have
switched to spousal benefits after I applied.  That would have gotten us about an
additional 3-4 months at her lower benefit, then a trade-up to our current benefits.  

But&hellip; when you see how hard it was to apply even in the _straightforward_ way, you can, I
hope, understand why we had no appetite to touch the system any more than we had to.  


## The Weekend Conclusion

Looks like it's all sorted out, for now.  

We'll keep watching the bank accounts to make
sure it _stays_ that way, so long as Trump is in office.  We don't want to be victims
unawares, of Republican mischief.  So I have calendar reminders set to check each bank
account on the appropriate day, to verify a benefit payments made a safe landing.  

As you can see, the Weekend Publisher and the Assistant Weekend Publisher remain
unconcerned.  It is difficult to disturb the Zen-like aplomb of well-loved cats.  

I shall continue to attempt to imitate them, contemplating the serene peace of the Weekend
Editrix's beautiful hillside shade garden.  

And, of course, writing about the descent of the US government into naked criminality.  At
my age, I'm a bit frustrated that this is just about _all_ I can do.

## Addendum 2025-Jul-08: Trump Uses SSA for Propaganda  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-28-soc-sec-journey-dkos-1.jpg" width="400" height="260" alt="Needham @ DailyKOS: Media shrugs off unhinged Social Security email" title="Needham @ DailyKOS: Media shrugs off unhinged Social Security email" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-28-soc-sec-journey-propaganda-email.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-28-soc-sec-journey-propaganda-email-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="461" alt="Trump propaganda email from the Social Security Administration" title="Trump propaganda email from the Social Security Administration" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
On 2025-Jul-04 (US Independence Day, of all things) we got an email from the Social
Security Administration.  Along with, apparently, about 71 million other Americans who had
ever made an account on the Social Security web site. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

Notably, as you can see from the little red eye icon, the email contained one of the
infamous "tracking pixels", that tattles to _somebody_ each time you open the email.  I've
blocked it here with
[PixelBlock, a Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem?hl=en&pli=1).
(However, the Chrome web store says it's "no longer available because it doesn't follow
best practices for Chrome extensions".  Apparently it's against Google policy not to roll
over submissively when they try to track you?  Sigh.  More corporate
[en&lt;_mumble_&gt;ification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification).)  

The email was, of course, not really about Social Security.  It was just blatant Trump propaganda
about the passage of his "One, Big, Beautiful Bill" gutting much of the US government.  

Amazingly, people continue to claim that the "OBBB" removes the Social Security taxation
originally imposed by Reagan in 1983 as a budget saver.  This taxation doesn't go into the
general fund, but back into the Social Security and Medicare trust
funds <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>:  

> Under legislation enacted in 1983, the Social Security Trust Funds receive income based
> on Federal income taxation of benefits. The funds receive taxes on up to 50 percent of
> benefits from single taxpayers with incomes over \\$25,000 and from taxpayers filing
> jointly with incomes over \\$32,000.  
>  
> Legislation enacted in 1993 extended taxation of benefits. The legislation increased the
> limitation on the amount of benefits subject to taxation from 50 percent to 85 percent
> for single taxpayers with incomes over \\$34,000 and for taxpayers filing jointly with
> incomes over \\$44,000. All additional tax income resulting from the 1993 legislation is
> deposited in Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund.  

Obviously, it would be massively stupid to remove that tax, as it would deplete the trust
funds _even faster_ than now, when it goes empty in the 2030's.

So, in part we're just propagating a lie based on the fact that people _don't actually know_
what's in the bill.  (As in: about 20% of Americans depend on Medicaid, basically health
insurance for the poor, administered to through state programs which usually rename it.
That all gets cut drastically just after the mid-term elections in 2026.)

On the other hand, the bill _does_ slightly increase the standard deduction and add a
"bonus" deduction for seniors.  (Though it phases out at higher incomes, and disappears
altogether after 4 years.)  This partially offsets Social Security taxation, in a
back-handed way that only applies in some cases. So they've inflated that to "We've made
your Social Security tax-free!"  

That is, of course, _lying._  In an official US government communication to seniors.  

A statement from the Social Security Commissioner, with florid Trump-worship:  

> "This is a historic step forward for America’s seniors," said Social Security
> Commissioner Frank Bisignano. "For nearly 90 years, Social Security has been a
> cornerstone of economic security for older Americans. By significantly reducing the tax
> burden on benefits, this legislation reaffirms President Trump’s promise to protect
> Social Security and helps ensure that seniors can better enjoy the retirement they’ve
> earned."  

Ok, so who is this Frank Bisignano guy?   A few bits of intel from
Wikipedia <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> reveal an unsavory character:  
- He's a Wall Street investment banker type, coming up through
  [JPMorgan Chase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase).
  He later worked at [First Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Data) (basically
  credit card servicing) and [Fiserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiserv) (basically
  fintech for banks and the like), growing by acquisitions.  So far, this is not exactly
  my taste and not exactly a political qualification, but generally ok.  
- He was the highest-paid CEO in the United States, clocking in at \\$100 million
  in 2017.  This puts him in a peculiar attitude to run pensions at Social Security.  
- Of his tenure at Fiserve, well&hellip; it wasn't pretty:  
  > Under Bisignano's tenure, hundreds of First Data and FiServ locations have closed,
  > resulting in the termination of thousands of employees. Employees who previously had
  > remote positions due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other legacy reasons have reportedly
  > been particularly targeted.[24]. Bisignano was heavily criticised for his leadership
  > during his time with Fiserv resulting in high attrition and drop in share price. His
  > view on lack of flexibility and focusing on people showcased his lack of empathy which
  > later was picked up by opposition parties prior to him joining the Trump
  > administration.  
- He's a long-time supporter of Republicans, in particular Trump.  Between Bisignano and
  his wife, they've donated about \\$1 million to Trump's campaigns.

If he thinks the Social Security administration is like an investment bank, he's deeply
confused about at least one of those things.  Indeed, he "joked" that he had to Google what
the Social Security Commissioner did&hellip; which is not exactly a signal of high
qualifications for the job.  

So it looks like he's a billionaire CEO, a manager who doesn't mind cruelty in mass
terminations, who appears to have bought his nomination with political donations despite
lack of fitness for the position.  Smells like the political equivalent of
[simony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simony), the medieval term for sale of church
positions, doesn't it?  

The Social Security letter concludes ironically with a promise:  

> Social Security remains committed to providing timely, accurate information to the
> public and will continue working closely with federal partners to ensure beneficiaries
> understand how this legislation may affect them.  

This promise is already broken by the misleading email in which it was sent.  

That is very on-brand for Trump.  

Once more, with feeling: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)
