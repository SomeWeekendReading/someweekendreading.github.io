Looking for a glimmer of hope amid the COVID clouds?  Worried about whether a vaccine will
be appropriately safe &amp; effective?  You've come to the right place.  

## A COVID Point of Hope

Derek Lowe is a med chemist (_don't_ say "mad" chemist; these guys are miracle workers)
who's been blogging about the triumphs and travails of working in the pharma industry for
years.  His blog, _In the Pipeline_, is now hosted at _Science_ magazine, which tells you
he's very well respected. <sup id="fn1a">[[1](#fn1)]</sup>  

<a href="https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/09/03/coronavirus-vaccine-roundup-early-september" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-09-03-covid-hope-and-vaccine-evaluations-derek-lowe.png" width="400" height="201" alt="Derek Lowe 'In the Pipeline'" title="Derek Lowe 'In the Pipeline'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
In [an article from 2020-sep-03](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/09/03/coronavirus-vaccine-roundup-early-september), updated Sep 17,
he surveys the (enormous!) COVID vaccine efforts ongoing.  It's only gotten bigger since
then: viral vectors, genetic vaccines, recombinant proteins, ... all sorts of stuff.  As
of today, there are around 300 vaccine efforts around the world, of which 40 or so are in
human clinical trials, and of which 4 are now in late-stage Phase 3 trials.  Lots of stuff
going on, and reason to have hope that with 300 shots on goal we should have at least a
couple successes!  

So take a look through Derek's survey, even though it's a month out of date.  (A month in
vaccine development used to be _nothing_, when vaccines took about 10 years.)  The
particular piece to which I believe more attention should be called is the last paragraph,
which gives us great hope for the future:  
> An excellent side effect is that vaccine technology will never be the same after this – it’s going to be like aircraft design before and after World War II, and for many of the same reasons. This whole pandemic has been awful, in many different ways, but we’re going to come out of it stronger and more capable than when we went in.  

We are indeed learning a lot.  In particular if the mRNA vaccines work, then we're on
track to rapid design of test candidates.  Though, to be fair, testing through Phase 3
will still take a year or so.  

## Evaluating a Vaccine in Paranoid Times

But... we live in paranoid times! <sup id="fn2a">[[2](#fn2)]</sup>   We're full of disinformation, lying, distrust, and general
disrespect for the truth.  Politicians are meddling with federal health agencies
scientific reporting and decision making.  People are for _absolutely no good reason_ suspicious of
vaccines. <sup id="fn3a">[[3](#fn3)]</sup>  Consequently, lots of people in the US,
despite the fear of COVID-19, say they won't take the vaccine because they fear the
vaccine more?!

Enter [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com) (did you know there's an election coming up, and
those folk are the _best_ at building statistical models of modern American election outcomes?).  
[A recent article on 538 by Maggie Koerth](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-know-when-you-can-trust-a-covid-19-vaccine/)
discusses how to know if you can _trust_ a vaccine.  (I never thought I'd even have to ask
that question, but... _o tempora, o mores_.)  The high points:  
- __Look for transparency in the data:__ Even if you don't review it yourself, ask if it was
  _disclosed_.  Don't listen to politician's opinions about vaccines, as they are not
  competent to have opinions worth hearing.  Listen to independent scientists, listen to
  your doctor.  
- __Listen to independent reviews:__ There's the FDA, of course, but also the IRB for the
  institution sponsoring the trial of the vaccine.  See if they tell you who's on the
  IRB.  
- __Be highly skeptical of anything released before the end of the year:__ It's just
  practically unreasonable to expect anything to be finished by then, and properly
  reviewed for efficacy and safety.  But the political incentives for bad actors in the
  right wing is _enormous_, and they haven't shown much capacity for self-control in that
  regard.  
- __Trust the experts who are being straight with you about the limitations above everyone
  else:__ People who tell you it's going to be like a measles vaccine, where you get
  near-perfect lifetime immunity, are either lying, ignorant, or stupid.  Listen to the
  experts who tell you about limitations, like
  [_quantitative_]({{ site.baseurl }}/Lord-Kelvin-on-quantitative-knowledge/) efficacy rates.  

So... you _can_ engage your critical thinking skills to decide properly.  It's not _all_ a
fireswamp of loud opinions.  __Science matters.__

## Notes  

<a id="fn1">1</a>: And funny: check out the
["things I won't work with"](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/category/things-i-wont-work-with) 
and 
["things I'm glad I don't do"](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/category/things-im-glad-i-dont-do)
categories of his blog.  The category 
["why everyone loves us"](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/category/why-everyone-loves-us) 
is also great for seeing what the general public's irrational hatred of pharma looks like from the
inside.  Yeah, we hate [Shkreli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Shkreli), too. [↩](#fn1a)  

<a id="fn2">2</a>: With deep historical roots!  You might want to re-read Richard Hofstader's
masterful article from 1964, [_The Paranoid Style in American Politics_](https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/).
The seeds planted back then have flowered in the most horrible way. [↩](#fn2a)  

<a id="fn3">3</a>: Most of it comes down to scaremongering by [Andrew Wakefield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield), 
who started the scare relating autism to vaccines.  His research was fraudulent, his
papers were retracted, and he lost his medical license.  It was so bad, he is barred from
the practice of medicine in both the US and in his native Britain.  So... he's not a good
reason to be suspicious of anything other than suspicion of _him_.[↩](#fn3a)
