The FDA VRBPAC (Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee) met this week
to discuss the composition of vaccines going forward.  In particular, should we
consolidate on a series of bivalent shots instead of the current mixture of old and new?  


## Yeah, it's been a while, hasn't it?  

It's been&hellip; what, 26 days since I posted here?!  And yes, this is being posted like
nearly a week after the FDA VRBPAC meeting, because it's a bit of a struggle for me.  

_Multissimae apologiae:_ I still have some post-COVID-19 brain fog and fatigue from
[our wrestle with COVID-19 last August]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-index-post/) here at Chez
Weekend.  There you can find 2 references to 2 papers <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
<sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> saying it takes 6-9 months in the
median to clear COVID-19 brain fog completely.  That means, in the median, I should expect
this mild cognitive impairment (it's _hard_ to take apart scientific papers right now!) to
begin lifting in February - April.  COVID-19 really did a number on me!  

Perhaps relatedly, I've been depressed in ways sufficiently dangerous to make me bestir
myself sufficiently to be prescribed anti-depressants again.  I've finally climbed the dose ramp
enough to be at the lower end of the clinically effective dose window, so now it's 4-6
weeks to see if there's an anti-depressant effect.  So&hellip; February - April, _again._  

Also: dental surgery?  Not as much fun as it sounds.  

I'm sort of hoping this coming spring will be _really_ good if we can pass by both
[Scylla _and_ Charybdis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Between_Scylla_and_Charybdis).  

But perhaps in the meantime I can write a bit via brute force, if not with the customary
speed.  

(And yes, comments are still broken.  I can't muster the energy to wrestle with cloud
deployment of [Staticman](https://staticman.net/) yet.  Maybe soon, once I have enough
brain cells firing simultaneously again.  The email link at the top of every page still
works, though.)  


## Our safari guides  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-stat-1.jpg" width="400" height="234" alt="Branswell &amp; Herper @ STAT News: Our safari guides" title="Branswell &amp; Herper @ STAT News: Our safari guides" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
As per usual, our safari guides from _STAT News_ are the redoubtable duo, Helen Branswell
&amp; Matthew Herper. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  They have a somewhat daunting
opener:  

> Fasten your seat belts, folks. Weâ€™re about to hit some turbulence.  
>  
> If you're reading this, you're interested in the discussion on the future of Covid-19
> vaccination that's going to take place today in a meeting of the Food and Drug
> Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee. We at STAT
> can't predict the outcome, but we know enough to expect that this meeting will feature
> some heated debate.  

They point out that although 70% of the US has had the primary series (first 2 shots),
booster uptake has been disgraceful and about 19% of Americans have had no doses at all.
That 19% is probably unreachable now by anything short of legal force.  So future
vaccination programs must be aimed at the rest of us: can we narrow down the multiple
brands, doses, and compositions of the vaccines?  

In particular, can we ditch the original Wuhan strain used now in the primary series in
favor of bivalent vaccines all around?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-stat-2.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="Herper @ STAT News: FDA proposal for annual COVID-19 boosters" title="Herper @ STAT News: FDA proposal for annual COVID-19 boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Even more so: can we agree to a policy of annual updates, e.g., look around in summer to
see which SARS-CoV2 strains are in circulation to make a multivalent booster available in
the fall?  We do this _all the time_ for flu, so maybe we should do it here.  The FDA
itself has even proposed this with annual COVID-19 boosters <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>,
though they're not brave enough to do it without VRBPAC sign-off.  

__NB:__ Vaccines discussed at this VRBPAC were Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Novavax.  J&amp;J will
not be discussed, as: (a) it did not achieve the "one &amp; done" single-shot advantage
hoped for, (b) it's lower efficacy, (c) it's associated with some rare clotting disorders,
and (d) it hasn't been updated for new strains or a multivalent formulation.  J&amp;J is ramping
down production of its vaccine.  

Branswell &amp; Herper's liveblog summary is worth reading, if you don't want to read the
primary source material (or, for that matter, the rest of this blog post).  


## Primary data sources

As per usual, the FDA's VRBPAC meeting announcement <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>
contains pointers (bottom of the page) to all the presentations (as well as administrative
matters, like who is in attendance, who has conflicts of interest, and that sort of thing).  

As is also usual in these matters, the materials are _supposed_ to be available several
days in advance for public comment.  In _practice_, a skeleton announcement goes up in
advance, but the main slide decks appear only at the last minute on the morning of the
meeting, because people always want to tweak until the last minute.  _C'est la vie._  

There is also on that page a link to the YouTube video capturing the whole meeting, in
case you want to sit through a day-long video.  (In which case: what's _wrong_ with you?!)  

### Meeting Discussion Topics &amp; Voting Question  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="320" alt="FDA VRBPAC: Meeting Discussion Topics" title="FDA VRBPAC: Meeting Discussion Topics" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The meeting discussion topics <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> are pretty clear:  
1. Whether we can __simplify the current kludge of multiple different vaccines and schedules.__
   Right now you have to receive 2 doses against the Wuhan strain, which is for all
   practical purposes extinct.  (It does give some cross-immunity, though.)  Only _then_
   are you eligible for the current bivalent booster that is closer to, but _not exactly_
   the same as, the current strains.  Surely we can just start by using whatever the
   current multivalent booster is, and maybe do 1 annual boost for most people and 2 for
   the old, some of the young, and the immunocompromised?  
2. How should we __adjust the composition of the vaccines__ to respond to future variants?
   We do this every year for influenza: in spring look at what's circulating in the
   southern hemisphere winter, and adjust our fall vaccine composition accordingly.
   Surely we can do something like that, and not always be behind the virus?  
   
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="205" alt="FDA VRBPAC: Meeting Voting Question" title="FDA VRBPAC: Meeting Voting Question" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Interestingly, though there are 2 discussion topics, there is only 1 voting
question.  <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  That's the one about how to update the
vaccine composition, but _not_ about harmonizing the dose schedule.  

I wonder why?  It appears they want to entertain discussion and hear opinions, but don't
want to be (nearly) bound by the result.  That's&hellip; curious, though not unprecedented.  

### Meeting presentations  

#### FDA briefing document  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-4.jpg" width="400" height="255" alt="FDA VRBPAC: FDA official briefing document" title="FDA VRBPAC: FDA official briefing document" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Pride of place _should_ first be given to the FDA's official briefing
document <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  I say "should", of course, because I'm going to
do no such thing.  These documents are notoriously dense and difficult to read, and their
content is more clearly presented in the slides from the meeting participants anyway.  So
that's 25 pages of word salad with no figures and no meaningful tables that I can skip.
(Still, if you really want to dive in, check the references.)  

Let's work through the talks in the order they were presented, according to the meeting
agenda. <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>  

#### FDA: Considerations for simplification of schedules &amp; periodic updates  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-5.jpg" width="400" height="214" alt="Kaslow @ FDA: Considerations for simplification &amp; periodic updates" title="Kaslow @ FDA: Considerations for simplification &amp; periodic updates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
First up is a brief talk by David Kaslow, of the Office of Vaccines Research and
Review. <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>  He's got several things to say about process and
how the discussion will be structured, which is of interest only if you want to know how
these meetings work.  

The relevant part of his presentation is teeing up the discussion questions:  
- Can we __simplify__ the COVID-19 vaccination process down to a single composition of
  vaccine and a less complex dose schedule (maybe based on age and other risk factors)?  
- Can we make __periodic updates__ to the vaccines to account for new strains, as we do
  now for influenza?  

Yes, it's sort of a formality.  But without this sort of formality, meetings tend to go
off the rails &amp; into the weeds.  

#### CDC: Current SARS-CoV2 epidemiology  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-1.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Scobie @ CDC: Current SARS-CoV2 epidemiology" title="Scobie @ CDC: Current SARS-CoV2 epidemiology" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The first content-oriented presentation was from Heather Scobie of the CDC, on the current
epidemiology of SARS-CoV2. <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>  

She makes a number of timely points:  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="232" alt="Scobie @ CDC: Trends in SARS-CoV2 variant proportions" title="Scobie @ CDC: Trends in SARS-CoV2 variant proportions" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- The trend in variant proportions is the usual ominous thing: yet another variant, even
  more infectious than the past, is taking over.  In the US as a whole, that appears to be
  the Omicron subvariant XBB.1.5 (an evolutionary descendant of Omicron/BA.2).  You can
  see this graphically from the plot of variant proportions over time (though the axis
  labels are garbled); if you look at the table the 95% confidence limits confirm this in
  a more objective way: the 95% LCL for XBB.1.5 is above the 95% UCL for the next most
  frequent variant, BQ.1.1.  So it's real, sadly enough.  
  
  At least XBB.1.5 seems to be _less_ likely to kill, though I don't know if that's a
  property of the virus or a property of a population that's got more immunity
  (than vaccination + previous infection) than we had in 2020 - 2021.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="247" alt="Scobie @ CDC: Monovalent vs bivalent sera neutralization of viral variants" title="Scobie @ CDC: Monovalent vs bivalent sera neutralization of viral variants" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Next she shows us the ability of blood sera from people with monovalent vs bivalent
  boosters to neutralize various viral variants, due to antibody activity.  Without diving
  into the weeds, higher is better on the vertical scale, and the vertical scale is
  logarithmic.  (There's some reasonable discussion to be had about the fact that
  antibodies aren't everything, and we should include T cell and memory B cell activity.
  But antibody activity is what we can easily measure right now.)  
  - Both monovalent &amp; bivalent vaccination have some activity against all strains, but
    mostly against the early strains.  
  - But look at the numbers: the activity of the bivalent booster against XBB.1 is about
    4x higher than monovalent.  

  So getting a bivalent booster seems like an _excellent_ idea.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Scobie @ CDC: COVID-19 weekly death rates stratified by age" title="Scobie @ CDC: COVID-19 weekly death rates stratified by age" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-5.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-5-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="Scobie @ CDC: 3-wk moving average pediatric hospitalizations for COVID-19" title="Scobie @ CDC: 3-wk moving average pediatric hospitalizations for COVID-19" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- There are some interesting facts about hospitalization and death rates.  
  - First, as expected, the death rates stratified by age show the highest rate among the
    elderly.  
  - Second, very much _not_ as I expected, the highest _hospitalization_ rates are among
    the very young!  Infants (&lt; 6mo) and toddlers (&lt; 24mo) are the most frequently
    hospitalized, perhaps because they are also the least vaccinated.  So all those
    rubrics about children having no significant risk are apparently empirically false.
    (There are tables on subsequent slides that make this clear, showing the
    hospitalization and death rates, normalized by age cohort size.)  

  So vaccinating your kids, even youngsters, seems like an excellent idea.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-6.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-6-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="223" alt="Scobie @ CDC: Death rates by vax status" title="Scobie @ CDC: Death rates by vax status" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Finally, she shows the miserable rate of bivalent booster uptake in the US (only 16%),
  and the rather grim consequences of that.
  - The unvaccinated die at very high rates indeed.  
  - The vaccinated are far more fortunate.  
  - But those most fortunate are those with the latest bivalent booster.  
  
  So getting the bivalent booster is a sensible move for anyone wishing not to die
  needlessly, which should include everyone who can medically tolerate the bivalent
  booster.  

So that's the epidemiological situation: not as grim as 2020 - 2021, but still not
pretty.  Fortunately, vaccination is an effective strategy.  Now if we only had an
effective _communications strategy_ to convince people of this&hellip;  

#### CDC: Vaccine efficacy  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-7.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="Link-Gelles @ CDC: COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness updates" title="Link-Gelles @ CDC: COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness updates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next was a presentation by Ruth Link-Gelles of the CDC <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>
on vaccine efficacy (VE) of:
- monovalent mRNA vaccines against symptomatic infection in children,  
- bivalent mRNA vaccines against symptomatic infection by XBB lineages in adults, and  
- bivalent mRNA vaccines vs hospitalization in older adults.  

Whenever discussing VE, it's important to state: (a) the population, (b) they viral
lineage extant at the time of data collection, and (c) the criteria for calling a positive
(typically symptoms, severe disease, hospitalization, or death).  Different choices will
lead to different results, largely incomparable to the results with other choices, so it's
important to know what the efficacy number _means!_  

##### Monovalent VE vs symptoms in children  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-8.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-8-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="Link-Gelles @ CDC: Pediatric efficacy vs symptomatic infection of monovalent Moderna" title="Link-Gelles @ CDC: Pediatric efficacy vs symptomatic infection of monovalent Moderna" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-9.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-9-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="Link-Gelles @ CDC: Pediatric (in)efficacy vs symptomatic infection of monovalent Pfizer" title="Link-Gelles @ CDC: Pediatric (in)efficacy vs symptomatic infection of monovalent Pfizer" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Do the monovalent vaccines work, or work well enough, in pediatric applications?  Either
just barely, or maybe not even that:  
- Her first result is that we have miserable booster uptake in the US, and in fact very
  low uptake of the primary series in young folk: 3.3% in &lt; 2yr and 5.1% in &lt; 5yr.  
- Add to that the fact that the VE of monovalent vaccines vs symptomatic infection is just
  not that strong in young people: Moderna is 57% (CL: 45% &ndash; 67%), and Pfizer's
  3-shot program is too variable to tell (CL &gt; 50%, presumably due to sparse data).
  So we _definitely_ need better pediatric vaccines, presumably like the multivalent
  booster.  

##### Bivalent VE vs XBB symptoms in adults  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-10.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-10-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="226" alt="Link-Gelles @ CDC: Bivalent vax efficacy in adults" title="Link-Gelles @ CDC: Bivalent vax efficacy in adults" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
How about the bivalent vaccines against symptomatic infection in adults?  Looks like the
efficacy is generally pretty good:  
- It seems they looked at Pfizer and Moderna together, or at least I could find no
  separate analyses.  
- They used 2 different amplification techniques to assess for BA.5 and XBB/XBB1.5 (BA.2)
  variants being present.  
- They also stratified into 3 age groups.  

Result: efficacy was remarkably stable, ranging for the most part from 40% &ndash; 50%.
In the very worst case the VE lower confidence limit was about 26%, so bounded well above
0%: the vaccines did actually help.  (Recall "symptomatic infection" is a high bar to
clear!  We really care about hospitalizations and deaths.)  

##### Bivalent VE vs hospitalization in older adults

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-11.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-11-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Link-Gelles @ CDC: VE vs hospitalization in older adults" title="Link-Gelles @ CDC: VE vs hospitalization in older adults" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The punchline is really just the top 2 datapoints shown on this slide:  
- With a bivalent booster, the elderly hospitalization VE is 72% (CL: 54% &ndash; 83%),
  which is very nice indeed.  
- On the other hand, for elders with just 2 monovalent doses (i.e., the primary series
  alone), the VE is only 25% (CL: -2% &ndash; 45%).  That is, at the 95% confidence level,
  it is not distinguishable from 0!  
  
So the moral is clear for elders: get the bivalent vaccine, to maximize your chances of
staying out of the hospital.  Somewhat surprisingly (to me): also kids are at significant
risk of hospitalization without the bivalent booster.  


#### mRNA bivalent booster safety analysis  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-12.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="Shimabukuro &amp; Klein: Bivalent vaccine safety" title="Shimabukuro & Klein: Bivalent vaccine safety" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next is a study of bivalent booster safety, by Tom Shimabukuro (Immunization Safety Office
of the CDC) and Nicola Klein (Director of Kaiser Permanente Vaccine Study
Center). <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>  Much of this was about their methodology and
how they study risk, so we'll skip that part.  Also, we're _almost_ certain the bivalent
vaccine is safe, certainly safer than COVID-19, so this is probably belt-and-suspenders
thinking.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-13.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-13-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="219" alt="Shimabukoru & Klein: Pfizer stroke signal" title="Shimabukoru & Klein: Pfizer stroke signal" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
But&hellip; that's not _quite_ what was found!  As you can see from their slide 11 shown
here, there was a stroke signal seen, for Pfizer only, for older subjects only, for
strokes.  When this was announced by the FDA on Jan 13, to much uninformed consternation,
they said it was "unlikely to be related" to vaccination.  Let's dig into the data and see
if we can understand why they said that, and whether we agree:  
- The way the study was designed, they counted events in the first 3 weeks after
  vaccination, and compared those to events _in the same group of people_ in weeks 4-6.
  - If the events right after vaccination were statistically significant higher (at the
    stringent significance level $p \le 0.01$), then a red flag went up.  
  - Also, they computed the Risk Ratio ($RR$) between the 2 periods.  If its 95%
    confidence limit was bounded _above_ 1, then a red flag went up.  
- As you can see here, all groups are in the clear _except_ over 65 and Pfizer: $RR \gt
  1$, $\mathrm{LCL}(RR) \gt 1$ and $p \lt 0.01$.  
- But for the over-65 Pfizer crowd, there _was_ a signal.  Let's use our binomial
  confidence interval of ratios code <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup> to check the $RR$
  here and see if we believe their numbers.  
  - This code was made for vaccine efficacy ratios, so we have to subtract its result from
    1, which will swap the UCL and LCL.  But I'm not gonna write a new script just for
    this, so cope!  
  - Also, they don't tell us how many people were in the trial, so we have to guess the
    number.  Fortunately, since the people in weeks 1-3 and the people in weeks 4-6 are
    the same people, that divides out in the central estimate and does not affect the
    confidence limits strongly (which we verified numerically).  So we'll just go with a
    nice big $N=10^5$ subjects:  
  ```R
  > 1 - efficacyAndCL(100000, 130, 100000, 92)
	   LCL      Eff      UCL 
  1.843864 1.413043 1.082901 
  ```
  - So basically we get $RR = 1.41$ with confidence limits of $(1.08, 1.84)$.  This
    compares reasonably favorably with the reported result shown on slide 11 of
	$RR = 1.47$ (CL: $1.11 - 1.95$). (At least, within the limits of the very crude
    statistic we're using for comparison!)  
  - So we believe their result.  

On the other hand, a number of things about this result are hinky:  
- In the discussion, it turned up that other databases with similar data don't see this
  effect, i.e., it's a one-time-only thing.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-14.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-14-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="Shimabukuro &amp; Klein: Stroke events clustering in time" title="Shimabukuro &amp; Klein: Stroke events clustering in time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Speaking of time, look at their slide 15, shown here.  See how the events all cluster in
  the early days of the trial, and then disappear?  The risk ratio peaks at 4.38 (!), but
  then declines to 1.47 at the end, diluted by all those days of normal rates of events.
  Something is very fishy here, because the early participants should be no different from
  the later participants, and vaccine-wise are in fact identical.
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-15.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-cdc-15-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="214" alt="Shimabukuro &amp; Klein: Stroke risk correlated with simultaneous adjuvanted/high dose flu vax" title="Shimabukuro &amp; Klein: Stroke risk correlated with simultaneous adjuvanted/high dose flu vax" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Next, consider their slide 21, shown here.  It shows that:
  - If people got either no flu vaccine or a normal dose flu vaccine on the same day, then
    there was no effect.
  - But if people got an adjuvanted flu vaccine (an additive to make it have stronger
    immune stimulation) or high-dose flu vaccine (again stronger immune stimulation for
    elders), then there _was_ an effect.  
  - They don't go so far as to show the high-dose flu vaccines were co-administered in the
    first part of the trial but not the second (to be consistent with the time clustering
    above), but this is another thing that directs attention away from the COVID-19
    vaccine and toward something else.  
- We note here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), that the effect
  happened for Pfizer, not for Moderna.  This, in spite of the fact that the vaccines are
  nearly identical, and Pfizer is dosed _lower._  Very odd, indeed!  
- Finally, as Branswell &amp; Herper point out, one of the VRBPAC panelists (Arthur
  Reingold, UC Berkeley) pointed out that the relevant signal comparison was to 
  _the rate of stroke in COVID-19 patients._  That is, there can be stroke risk in
  vaccinees, but it's still better than getting COVID-19!  
  
So there are several reasons _not_ to associate this stroke signal with the vaccine:  
1. It was a one-study-only effect not seen elsewhere.  
2. The effect happened in a limited time window and didn't repeat.  
3. It looked like it was somehow related to high-dose flu vaccination at the same time.  
4. It didn't replicate with Moderna.   
5. COVID-19 has significant stroke risk probably greater than this anyway.  

So it's easy to see how the FDA could say it was "unlikely to be related" to COVID-19
vaccination, given all the inconsistencies around the edges.  

That being said, here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, your humble Weekend Editor and the exalted
Weekend Editrix both got Moderna and high-dose flu vaccinations on the same day (albeit
before this was known).  We're fine.  

#### mRNA bivalent booster safety analysis, redux  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-6.jpg" width="400" height="197" alt="Forshee @ FDA: Another safety &amp; efficacy study of bivalent vaccines" title="Forshee @ FDA: Another safety &amp; efficacy study of bivalent vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next was _another_ safety/efficacy evaluation of the bivalent vaccines, this time by the
FDA itself, presented by Richard Forshee. <sup id="fn15a">[[15]](#fn15)</sup>  

This talk reports analyses of medical records of _millions_ of people, with therefore very
high statistical significance.  Some are Medicare, some from insurance companies, some
from hospitals,&hellip; a little bit of everything available.  

They have 2 important results, which we'll summarize instead of presenting slide-by-slide:  

1. _No stroke signal for Pfizer or Moderna,_ in contrast to the previous study.  The risk
   ratio for the study remained below 1, of which the authors say: "We reached the maximum
   length of surveillance without a signal".  Also, there was no relationship to
   simultaneous flu vaccination.  
   
   __However:__ Just in case, the FDA is doing a formal epidemiological study on the risks
   of co-vaccination vs flu and COVID-19 in 2023-2024.  They're taking this seriously,
   despite every indication it's a fluke.  

2. The real-world efficacy vs death and hospitalization in nursing home patients (at the
   highest risk) is _much better with the bivalent booster than without._  E.g., VE vs death
   is 88.7% for bivalent and only 55.7% with monovalent, during the Delta wave.
   Basically, the bivalent vaccines are _better._  
   
Well, that's a relief.  Yet more reason to disregard the hinky stroke signal above.  

#### NIH study of multivalent vaccines  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-nih-1.jpg" width="400" height="216" alt="Beigel @ NIH: Evaluation of next-generation COVID-19 vaccines" title="Beigel @ NIH: Evaluation of next-generation COVID-19 vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next was an evaluation of "next-generation" COVID-19 vaccines by John Beigel at the 
NIH and NIAID. <sup id="fn16a">[[16]](#fn16)</sup>  He's using "next-generation" here to mean
future multivalent vaccines, nasal vaccines, pan-coronavirus vaccines, and vaccines with
something beyond the spike protein (e.g., target protein + nucleocapsid protein, which is
less variable).  However, that's mostly speculative and the bulk of my interest in his
talk is in the background information.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-nih-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-nih-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="219" alt="Beigel @ NIH: Cartoon of viral variants over time" title="Beigel @ NIH: Cartoon of viral variants over time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
He's got a nice cartoon portrayal of the relative abundance of the viral variants in the
US over time, shown here.  It doesn't really tell us much that we probably don't all know
already, but it does so in a way that was visually striking to me.  Interesting point:
after about 2022-Nov, it's all Omicron, all the time.  Nothing but Omicron variants from
there on out.

So it made sense to make a bivalent Omicron-based booster.  The older variants are
(almost?) extinct and thus including the original Wuhan variant in the latest booster was
likely an extreme excess of caution.  I mean, it didn't _hurt_, but it also didn't _help._  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-nih-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-nih-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="214" alt="Beigel @ NIH: 'Antigenic Distance' of viral variants and sera" title="Beigel @ NIH: 'Antigenic Distance' of viral variants and sera" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Beigel went on to use his "antigenic space" method to portray both the sera of recovered
patients and the viral variants in the same 2-d space.  This is apparently nearly the same
method that he used in the
[VRBPAC of 2022-Apr-08]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-vrbpac-booster-policy/#sars-cov-2-antigenic-space),
where the participants described it as "complex" and "very hard to judge."  Don't get me
wrong: I'm probably a bigger fan of
[multidimensional scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling)
and [singular value decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition)
than the next guy!  But there comes a time when your client just _refuses_ to try to
understand what you're saying, and it's time to try saying it another way.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-nih-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-nih-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Beigel @ NIH: Vaccine efficacy correlates with neutralizing Ab titer" title="Beigel @ NIH: Vaccine efficacy correlates with neutralizing Ab titer" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Periodically, people complain about using neutralizing antibody titers as a proxy for
real-world protection.  They have a point: antibodies are short-term protection, whereas
the longer-term protection we all want is in T cell and memory B cell responses.  

Here, Beigel does us a service: he measures the correlation between vaccine efficacy (rate
of infection in various cohorts) and their corresponding antibody levels.  Imperfect as
antibodies may be in a physical world modeling sense, they are at least strongly
_correlated_ with vaccine efficacy.  (A point against Beigel: he doesn't report an $R^2$
or show the regression details, just draws in some presumed regression lines of
attractively positive slope.  C'mon, man!)  

So&hellip; certainly not perfect, but maybe good enough to be getting on with?  

There's also some discussion about nasal vaccines and other new technologies, but it's all
pretty speculative at this point so I won't go over that.  

He reaches 2 broad conclusions:  
1. __Efficacy:__ Severe &gt; Symptomatic &gt;&gt; asymptomatic &amp; transmission
2. __Next gen vaccines:__ must do better, and there's some confusion about what to measure
   (nasal, oral, pulmonary samples)  

Next came the 3 vendor presentations from Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax.  

#### Moderna presentation  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-moderna-1.jpg" width="400" height="231" alt="Moderna presentation" title="Moderna presentation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Moderna's presentation <sup id="fn17a">[[17]](#fn17)</sup> details a bunch of studies
they've done on the Wuhan + BA.1 bivalent and the now-EUA'd Wuhan + BA.4/5 bivalent
vaccine.  (And a certain amount of yay-rah corporate propaganda, which we all expect and
discount accordingly.)  

To be honest, I was both pleased and a bit disappointed in what I saw here.  Disappointed,
because there wasn't much new that we didn't already know or could infer from the previous
FDA/CDC/NIH presentations.  On the other hand, pleased because that's pretty good news:
the bivalent vaccines work, and are safe.  We now have that documented very, very
thoroughly.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-moderna-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-moderna-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="Moderna: Non-inferiority of BA.1 bivalent vs original vaccine in 3 viral lineages" title="***" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Consider, for example, their slide 22, shown here.  It shows Kaplan-Meier curves, with the
incidence of COVID-19 on the vertical axis (lower is better) and time since vaccination on
the horizontal axis.  The original vaccine is shown in blue, and the (old) BA.1 + Wuhan
bivalent vaccine is in green.  We're looking at 3 Omicron-class viral variants: the BA.2
sublineage, the BA.4 sublineage, and the BA.5 sublineage.  

The clear conclusion: the bivalent mixture is _superior_ against BA.1 and BA.4, and
non-inferior against BA.5.  This is what we expected, but also what we want to see.  

Good news&hellip; ho hum.  

Good job, though.  I'm glad to have gotten the Moderna Wuhan + BA.4/5 bivalent.  

#### Pfizer presentation  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-pfizer-1.jpg" width="400" height="246" alt="Pfizer presentation" title="Pfizer presentation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
To be honest again, I had about the same reaction to Pfizer's
presentation. <sup id="fn18a">[[18]](#fn18)</sup>  It's slightly disappointingly just stuff
we already knew, could have inferred, or guessed with very high plausibility.  On the
other hand, it's all good news that the bivalent boosters really, really work better.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-pfizer-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-pfizer-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="230" alt="Pfizer: superiority against BA.4/5, non-inferiority against reference strain, age &gt; 55yr" title="Pfizer: superiority against BA.4/5, non-inferiority against reference strain, age &gt; 55yr" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here, for example, is their slide 8 showing the results of a comparison of the BA.4/5 +
Wuhan bivalent booster versus the original vaccination.  (This is in subjects aged &gt; 55
years; there's a similar slide for younger people showing the same result.)  It shows, in
particular detail, 2 bits of good news (that we probably guessed and hoped would be the case):  
1. The new bivalent vaccine is _superior_ to the classic vaccine when it encounters
   BA.4/5.  This is to be expected, since it contains spike protein _specific to_ BA.4/5,
   whereas the old vaccine has to rely on cross-immunity of the "kinda similar" Wuhan
   strain.  
2. The new bivalent vaccine is _non-inferior_ to the old vaccine, when presented with the
   old virus.  The old virus is more or less extinct, but this still matters: the old
   virus can't come roaring back to bite us all once again if we switch to the new
   vaccine.  
   
So, yeah.  

Good news.  Ho hum.  :-)

One interesting tidbit that came out in discussion: Pfizer says it needs 100 days from the
time the strain is selected to producing a new vaccine.  So if we select a new strain at
the _beginning_ of June, we can expect vaccine _starting_ to be available in mid-September
in time for a winter booster campaign.  Moderna didn't say specifically the time
requirement, but they didn't object to this.  Novavax, which makes a protein-based
vaccine, can't make this timeline: they need to know by early spring to adjust their
protein manufacturing pipeline.  

That's one of the (many) benefits of the mRNA vaccine technology.  

#### Novavax presentation  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-novavax-1.jpg" width="400" height="190" alt="Novavax presentation" title="Novavax presentation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The 3rd vendor, less well known, is Novavax. <sup id="fn19a">[[19]](#fn19)</sup>  They
make a more traditional protein-based vaccine, which takes a bit more time to develop in
the first place and to adapt to new strains.  They have not yet made a bivalent vaccine.  

My guess is their main _raison d'&ecirc;tre_ is to be an alternative for people still
superstitiously suspicious of mRNA vaccines.  (Well, anything that gets them vaccinated, so
they live and not die, says me.)  

Right out of the gate, they say their existing vaccine has lower response to BQ.1.1 and
XBB.1 variants, due to mutations in otherwise-conserved epitopes on the spike protein.
Disappointing, but again to be expected.  

However, they now have a couple prototype strain vaccines vs BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5.  They
have a bunch of studies showing these more or less work, though their manufacturing
pipeline is significantly less agile than the mRNA pipelines.  

#### FDA consideration on strains for future multivalent vaccines  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-7.jpg" width="400" height="211" alt="Weir @ FDA: Considerations for viral strains in future boosters" title="Weir @ FDA: Considerations for viral strains in future boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Finally, there was one more presentation from the FDA, presented by Jerry Weir, on
considerations for choosing the viral strains go to into future
vaccines.  <sup id="fn20a">[[20]](#fn20)</sup>  This has been discussed at previous VRBPAC
meetings (which this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads summarized on
[2022-Apr-08]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-vrbpac-booster-policy/) and
[2022-Jun-28]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-vrbpac-variant-boosters/)).  


<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-8.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-fda-8-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="237" alt="Weir @ FDA: Current SARS-CoV2 phylogenetic tree" title="Weir @ FDA: Current SARS-CoV2 phylogenetic tree" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
As a point of side interest, he showed us the latest phylogenetic tree of the viral
variants.  It's really interesting to me to see that Delta was so thoroughly dominant last
year, but now Omicron is even though it evolved from a completely different, and older
branch of the tree.  Those old viruses are still out there, still conniving to kill us
better.  

After some discussion of the epidemiology (which we've already seen) and the improved
antibody titers from the bivalent vaccines (which we've also already seen), he gets on to
his main point: we need to simplify vaccination.  There should be probably just 1 vaccine,
a multivalent reflecting the current strains and maybe some insurance against past
strains.  Also, the schedule for who gets boosted when and how often needs to be
simplified.  

With regard to the boosting schedule, he suggests (slide 17):  
1. The general population (most adults, older children, and young children previously
   immunized) should get 1 booster a year.  
2. Higher-risk older adults, the immunocompromised, and young children with no previous
   vaccination should probably get 2 boosters a year.  
   
You can like it or not, but at least it's (pretty) clear and simple.  

With regard to vaccine composition, he suggests:  
1. Strain surveillance leading to a VRBPAC meeting in May or early June to decide what
   strains pose a public health threat.  (Emergencies could of course make the VRBPAC
   convene at any time, as has been done in the past for H1N1 influenza.)
2. Manufacturers target September for initial vaccine delivery.  __NB:__ Pfizer/BioNTech
   and Moderna can do this with their mRNA pipelines, but Novavax cannot meet this deadline
   with their protein-based vaccine (they would need to know by early spring).  

### Meeting discussion &amp; voting  

Well, that was quite a huge pile of presentations, most of which said what seemed to be
the Obvious Correct Thing.  Branswell &amp; Herper were expecting quite fractious debate.
And there was _some_, but not very much; it was about:
- what the T cells are doing, 
- when vaccines should be given (no clear COVID-19 seasonality yet, but the seasonal
  strain of flu and RSV is clear, so getting COVID-19 vax to relieve hospital strain from
  those might make sense), 
- how long to give manufacturers to update for new strains, 
- what input the rest of the world has into strain selection,
- how a 2-shot r&eacute;gime for little kids interacts with Pfizer's 3-shot paradigm,
- how we will develop better vaccines like nasal mucosal vaccines &amp; pan-coronavirus vaccines,
&hellip; and so on.  Notably, _not_ much about the voting or discussion questions.  

The voting question, shown above, was about the Obvious Correct Thing: should we harmonize
all the vaccinations to be the same multivalent mixture that is appropriate that year?
This __passed, 21 yes votes to 0 no votes.__  Unanimous VRBPAC verdicts are not that frequent,
so this is a pretty strong endorsement.  (The FDA management has to endorse this formally for it to
take effect.)  

Not everybody on the VRBPAC liked the idea of annual boosters going forward; some wanted
to see more data in the future before committing to this.  But it makes sense to your
humble Weekend Editor that we should prepare _now_ for that eventuality.  The CDC's ACIP
(Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice) will have something to say about that.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

It seems like this was an awful lot of machinery to crank up just to come to the only
sensible conclusion?  Even though, as we've previously noted on this Crummy Little Blog
That Nobody Reads, they've
[previously promised to review COVID-19 vaccine composition quickly like they already do with flu vaccines.]({{ site.baseurl }}/variants-vs-vaccines/#what-about-the-fda)  

My personal guess is that a lot of this is due to 2 reasons:
- The natural extreme caution of medical regulatory bodies, where they want to be _sure_
  they're not hurting anybody, and _probably_ doing some good.  
- The superstitious fear of COVID-19 vaccinations among about 1/5 of the US population.
  They again want to be _sure_ they can point to hard evidence for their decisions, since
  being hauled in front of a Congressional committee headed by intellectual giants like
  Marjorie Taylor Green would drive anybody into detailed, defensive documentation.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-toro.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-01-27-fda-vrbpac-covid-vaccine-composition-changes-toro-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="440" alt="Tom Toro @ New Yorker: Repeating history" title="Tom Toro @ New Yorker: Repeating history" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
We've seen the results of the influence of sad, right-wing conspiracy thinking before.  As
the philosopher [George Santayana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santayana) put it:  

> "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." &ndash; George
> Santayana, _The Life of Reason_, 1905.  

Or, if you prefer the more modern cynical take, see the cartoon by Tom Toro from the _New
Yorker_ shown here.  (Toro [sells signed prints of it in his Etsy shop.](https://www.etsy.com/listing/682771837/signed-print-of-my-cartoon-those-who))  

Why can't we at least make _original_ mistakes?  

Still, excesses of caution aside, the FDA VRBPAC did the right thing, and unanimously at
that.  Bravo to them, if not to the climate in which they (and we) must operate.
