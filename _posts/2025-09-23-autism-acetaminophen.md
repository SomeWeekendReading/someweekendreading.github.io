So, Trump and Kennedy announce _ex cathedra_ that acetaminophen during pregnancy causes
autism.  Is this stupid or not?  


## What Has He Tried to Claim _Now?_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-23-autism-acetaminophen-cnn-1.jpg" width="400" height="141" alt="Christensen, et al. @ CNN: Trump links acetaminophen to autism, despite evidence of safety" title="Christensen, et al. @ CNN: Trump links acetaminophen to autism, despite evidence of safety" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
After the CDC ACIP vaccine fiasco, and amidst the continuing debacle of failing to release
the Epstein files, the Trumpists need a distraction.  RFKJr of course can be relied upon
to supply controversial distractions at a moment's notice.  

He's been teasing that he'll tell us all what the cause of autism is, despite literally
decades of evidence involving mostly genetics and a few environmental insults.  Today was
the day, when Trump (of course) seized the spotlight and announced that the New Correct
Opinion in Trumpland was that use of acetaminophen (paracetamol/Tylenol) during pregnancy
was _somehow_ to blame.  

CNN <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, for example, reports:  

> President Donald Trump announced Monday that the US Food and Drug Administration will
> notify doctors that the use of Tylenol during pregnancy can be associated with a “very
> increased risk of autism,” despite decades of evidence that it is safe.  

Trump was unable to pronounce "acetaminophen", despite offering medical advice on the
subject.  So he said the brand name "Tylenol" instead, a brand with an army of lawyers to
defend it.  That should be interesting to watch.  

Not content with dispensing unqualified medical advice on a subject about which they know
nothing, they proceeded to say the FDA will recommend leucovorin for the _treatment_ of
autism.  Leucovorin is a high-dose calcium/folinic acid drug, typically used with cancer
patients whose minerals are out of whack from chemotherapy.  

The commercially branded version, Wellcovorin, was made by Glaxo-Smith Kline.  However,
since GSK stopped marketing it 27 years ago, the FDA withdrew approval.  Now the FDA will
be forced to re-approve it, with an indication for autism where it has never been tested.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-23-autism-acetaminophen-newsweek-1.jpg" width="400" height="205" alt="Plummer @ Newsweek: Dr Oz invested in supplement company selling leucovorin" title="Plummer @ Newsweek: Dr Oz invested in supplement company selling leucovorin" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Somewhat more disturbingly, there are generic versions of leucovorin supplied by various
unregulated or very lightly regulated supplement companies.  They stand to make a bundle
if there's significant demand for leucovorin.  Dr. Mehmet Oz, known as "Dr Oz", is a
wealthy, controversial, celebrity doctor, and now Trump's administrator for the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS).  He's also a significant investor in
iHerb <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, a California supplement company that sells the folinic
acid part of leucovorin.  

It _stinks_ that the wildly weird recommended therapy is now something that will profit
Trump people.  Oz says he will divest, but in the Trump administration _nobody_ divests.  

CNN concludes with some real medical evaluation of their autism medical advice:  

> Dr. Arthur Caplan of the NYU Grossman School of Medicine Division of Medical Ethics
> called the announcement “the saddest display of a lack of evidence, rumors, recycling
> old myths, lousy advice, outright lies, and dangerous advice I have ever witnessed by
> anyone in authority in the world claiming to know anything about science.”  
>  
> “What was said was not only unsupported and wrong but flat out malpractice in managing
> pregnancy and protecting fetal life,” he wrote in an email.  

Sounds about right.  


## Let's Consult the Science

[AsapSCIENCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsapScience) is a Canadian YouTube channel run
by two people who are pretty good at explaining science with a dash of humor.
(Occasionally one of them will be flamboyantly, performatively gay in a way that makes it
all the more charming and hilarious. As in, a quote I half-remember: "Think of me as your
cool gay science uncle.") They are both qualified as actual scientists.  

Here's their latest video explainer on autism and acetaminophen:  
- Autism is complicated, mostly genetic with implications for many genes.  
- Acetaminophen has nothing to do with it.  
- Any purported rise is due to better diagnostic tools and expanding of the criteria (to
  include adults, include Asperger's, and so on &ndash; in the 60s, you basically had to
  be nonverbal to be considered autistic).  
  
It's a good summary for those of you who don't want to wade through a paper.  

But let's face it: you know what kind of Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR)
this is.  You wouldn't be here if you didn't want to wade through the relevant science
papers.  So the latest meeting of Some Weekend Reading Journal Club is now in session!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-23-autism-acetaminophen-jama-1.jpg" width="400" height="394" alt="VH Alqvist et al. @ JAMA: Acetaminophen in pregnancy NOT related to various bad outcomes" title="VH Alqvist et al. @ JAMA: Acetaminophen in pregnancy NOT related to various bad outcomes" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Our paper today is not only fully peer reviewed, but published in the prestigious Journal
of the American Medical Association (JAMA).  

It's a _big_ study by Ahlqvist, _et al._ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> of a nationwide
cohort of 2,480,979 children born in Sweden in 1995 - 2019 to 1,387,240 birthing parents.
(Let's hear it once again for the positive impact on research of universal health care and
universal electronic medical records!)  
- After filtering for one thing and another, as shown in the flow diagram reproduced here,
  they had 185,909 children exposed to acetaminophen during pregnancy and 2,294,888
  children who were _not_ so exposed.  
- They then diagnosed who among each group of children had a neurodevelopmental
  condition.  In this particular study, that amounted to autism, ADHD, or intellectual
  disability.  
- They first did a comparison between all the kids in each group, and then later did a
  genetics-sensitive comparison using only siblings that were exposed to acetaminophen vs
  not.  (The latter will become _important_ anon!)  
- The differences in rates between the acetaminophen vs no acetaminophen kids was
  measured, as is absolutely standard, with hazard ratios and their 95% confidence
  intervals.  
  - First, the ["hazard rate"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate#Hazard_rate) is
    the probability that a certain event occurs, conditional on not occurring at a
    previous time.  In this situation, it's just the probability of a neurodevelopmental
    condition.  
  - Second, the ["hazard ratio"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_ratio), or HR, is
    the ratio of the hazard rates between 2 groups.  Here it's the ratio of the
    probability of neurodevelopmental condition in the acetaminophen exposed group vs the
    non-acetaminophen group.  
	- If HR &gt; 1 then the acetaminophen group has a higher risk; if HR &lt; 1 then it
      has a lower risk.  
	- We then use statistics to get a 95% confidence interval on HR.  To draw a
      statistically significant conclusion, we want either HR < 1 or HR > 1 and the 95%
      confidence interval all on the same side of 1.  That is, we want to be 97.5%
      confident that the hazard ratio is on the side we think it is.  

Now let's consider Alqvist, _et al._'s results, shown in the figure below.  
- If the HR is to the left, it's &lt; 1 and the drug involved was _protective_ against the
  problem.  If it's to the right, then the drug is a _risk_ for the problem.
  - It's only statistically significant if the error bar is wholly above or below 1.  
- They considered separately the neurodevelopmental conditions of autism, ADHD, and
  intellectual disability.  
- They computed HR and its 95% confidence interval for multiple kinds of groups:  
  - Those exposed vs not exposed to acetaminophen, aspirin, non-aspirin NSAIDs (e.g.,
    ibuprofen?), opioids (who takes opioids when pregnant?!), and antimigraine drugs.  
  - They compared the exposed/non-exposed groups in the whole population, and then did a
    more refined comparison using only siblings in the same family who had been
    exposed/non-exposed.  

The latter distinction, i.e., using matched sibling pairs only, is important.  If you just
look at the general population, you're assuming there is no genetic component to the
neurodevelopmental condition and thus the drug is the only relevant thing to measure.  But
we know, for example in autism, that genetics is a big factor!  So by measuring between
siblings, we control for genetics and ask if the drug was an _additional_ risk factor,
above and beyond genetics.  

The latter is The Correct Question to be asking here.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-23-autism-acetaminophen-jama-3.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-23-autism-acetaminophen-jama-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="457" alt="Ahlqvist, et al. @ JAMA: Non-relationship of acetaminophen to autism, accounting for genetics" title="Ahlqvist, et al. @ JAMA: Non-relationship of acetaminophen to autism, accounting for genetics" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Look at the first 2 lines in the figure (click to embiggen), which are the influence of
acetaminophen on autism:  
- The first line, showing the Hazard Ratio for the general population, is ever so slightly
  greater than 1: HR = 1.05 (95% CL: 1.02 - 1.08).  
  
  This is what all the shooting is about!  
- However, in the second line, we see the effect of controlling for genetics: HR = 0.98
  (95% CL: 0.93 - 1.04).  
  
  That is, the central estimate says acetaminophen is _mildly protective_ against autism,
  though the error bar says it's not statistically significant.  In other words, _no effect._  
  
__Result:__ There is no evidence whatsoever that associates acetaminophen with autism.
Studies saying this are poorly controlled, failing to account for the known genetic
component of autism.  As shown here, using siblings to control for genetics
being the same on both sides, _there is no effect._  

Now look at the rest of the figure.  _In every single case, the result is the same!_  If
there is a mild effect when doing a genetics-ignorant comparison of the whole population,
the effect goes away when you do a proper sibling comparison.  

The sole exception is near the bottom, considering the risk of aspirin for intellectual
disability:  
- The general population comparison shows a mild, not statistically significant
  risk.  However, the genetically proper sibling comparison shows a statistically
  _significant_ result that _aspirin is protective against intellectual disability:_ 
  HR = 0.71 (95% CL: 0.57 - 0.88).  
- At the top of the chart, there's a just-barely significant result showing aspirin is
  protective against autism too.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-23-autism-acetaminophen-jama-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-23-autism-acetaminophen-jama-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="275" alt="Ahlqvist, et al. @ JAMA: Acetaminophen is not dose-responsive in autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability hazards" title="Ahlqvist, et al. @ JAMA: Acetaminophen is not dose-responsive in autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability hazards" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Interestingly, but unfortunately buried in the supplement, is a test for
dose-responsiveness of acetaminophen.  If acetaminophen were really a cause, you'd expect
high dose situations to produce a higher likelihood of autism, ADHD, or intellectual
disability.  This should show up in a hazard ratio that rises monotonically with dose.  

This figure shows the hazard ratios as a function of acetaminophen dose.  The blue bands
are for the (bogus) population-wide comparison, and the pink bands are for the (properly
genetics-controlled) sibling comparison.  There is no meaningful, monotonic trend with
acetaminophen dose.  At all doses, the sibling comparison shows _no effect at all,_ when
genetics is properly taken into account.  

Any acetaminophen/autism link is very, _very_ thoroughly debunked!  

__Conclusions:__
- This study is _awesomely_ well powered, using essentially the entire population of
  Sweden over a period of 3 years.  
- Acetaminophen, and pretty much everything else studied except aspirin, is _not_
  associated with autism, ADHD, or intellectual disability.  
- Anybody saying otherwise is doing a genetics-ignorant comparison, attempting to ignore
  the known strong genetic influence on those conditions.  
- Checking for dose-responsiveness further rules out any association of acetaminophen with
  autism, ADHD, and intellectual disability.  
- The single exception is _favorable:_ aspirin looks mildly protective against autism and
  rather more strongly protective against intellectual disability.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

__Summary:__ Yes, what they said is stupid.  Acetaminophen, during pregnancy or not, has
nothing to do with autism.  It has everything to do with Republican disdain for science,
even for the very notion of evidence.  (And, possibly, with making a corrupt profit for
Dr. Oz; still waiting to see if he divests.)  

And their desire to distract from their massive policy failures and destruction of
democracy.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-23-autism-acetaminophen-weekend-publishers.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-23-autism-acetaminophen-weekend-publishers-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="275" alt="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher are not any more than momentarily distracted" title="The Weekend Publisher and Assistant Weekend Publisher are not any more than momentarily distracted" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Don't be distracted.  

Here, as an instructive example, are the Weekend Publisher and the Assistant Weekend
Publisher.  (Given l'affaire Jimmy Kimmel, I thought I should consult with the publishers
before offering an anti-Trump editorial opinion.)  As you can see, they are not distracted by the
latest Trump&hellip; emissions.  In fact, they are not even much distracted from their nap
schedule.  

We should ignore their idiotic pronouncements, and keep up the grassroots political
activity to throw them out ASAP.
