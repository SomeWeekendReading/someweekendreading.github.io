So, did I hear there was an eclipse today?  


## The Experimental Evidence

Yep, looks like an eclipse!  

This is a [pinhole projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera_model) on my
kitchen counter.  The "camera" was a small piece of paper into which I poked a hole with a
pen.  

It was taken somewhat before the max here in Boston.  

The cats seemed kind of worried, and tried to convince me that oncoming darkness meant it
was cat dinner time.  Didn't work; worth a shot.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Always use _enough_ tech to work the problem, but no _more_ than that, I always say.  

The times being as sad as they are, I also always say:
