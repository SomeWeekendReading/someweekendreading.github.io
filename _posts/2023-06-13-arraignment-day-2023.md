Today in the US, we again experimented with a new national commemorative holiday:
Arraignment Day for Donald Trump.  


## The Details?  

Well, not so much.  Arraignments are usually pretty straightforward affairs, more or less
bookkeeping.  Trump showed up _in propria persona_, pled not guilty, and left.  

Of course there was weirdness:  
- Trump didn't have to get a mugshot.  They used a public photo instead.  
  - However, his co-defendant in these matters, Mr. Nauta, _did_ have to do so.  
- Afterward, Trump was not remanded into custody.  Instead, he repaired to a local Cuban
  restaurant, center of the _very_ conservative, _very_ Republican, elders of the Cuban
  exile community in Miami, and threw a little party.  Then he departed on his private jet
  for his private club in New Jersey.  
  - Other people who have concealed/passed on classified docs go directly to jail, even
    before indictment, let alone arraignment.  Perhaps they "threw a little party" in
    their cells.  

Tell me again about how we don't have 2 tiers of justice in the US.  

Well, it's slow.  But it's progress.  Of a sort.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Your handy US progress meter:  

- __Indictment Day__, when the US Department of Justice decides there's a criminal case
    against Trump ready to try.  [Done 2023-Jun-08]({{ site.baseurl }}/indictment-day-2023)!  
- __Arraignment Day,__ when Trump will have to appear in court to enter a plea.  Done today!  
- __Conviction Day,__ when some semblance of law and order will be restored to the US.  
- __Sentencing Day,__ when we can all breathe a sigh of relief and look forward to hearing 
   _nothing about the imprisoned Donald Trump ever again_ (until, perhaps, a funeral announcement).
