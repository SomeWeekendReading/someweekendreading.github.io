title: Too Much AND Too Little COVID-19?!

Recently Trump-appointed judges in the US have ruled that they can overturn Biden policies
because there is simultaneously too much COVID-19 _and_ too little COVID-19.  They're not
even pretending to be rational any more.  


## Too much AND too little COVID-19?!  

It came to my attention thus, from a chaired professor of social science at NYU, who might
thus be suspected of knowing what he's talking about re social policy:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    So to be clear, conservative judges have ruled that: 1) COVID is no longer a great threat so the CDC has no right to mandate masks on airplanes and 2) COVID is such a grave hazard that the US must deny entry to migrants to protect American public health. <a href="https://t.co/JxzsN9uWcI">https://t.co/JxzsN9uWcI</a>

So let's unpack for a moment what he's talking about.  Following
[_The Hunting of the Snark_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hunting_of_the_Snark),
this is "an agony in 2 fits":  

### Fit the First: Serious COVID-19 Risk as an Excuse to Block Migrants

Jordan &amp; Sullivan have a pretty good explainer in the _NYT_. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

Let's face it: Republicans are xenophobic, which causes them a great deal of anxiety about
immigration, legal or illegal.  
- Trump, ever cunning, figured out how to exploit that.  He
  could leverage people's fears that migrants brought disease via Title 42: require
  migrants, including refugees, not be permitted to enter the US on the basis of public
  health.  
- Biden has lately not been enforcing this, and was moving to repeal it.  Several southern
  states, ever the bastions of racism and xenophobia, sued to prevent him.  Judge
  Summerhays, a Trump appointee, agreed: COVID is so serious a public health threat that the
  law requires blocking migration.  

This _in spite of_ a ruling from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying
otherwise: the gut feeling of a Republican judge is more important than scientific
judgement.  

Conservatives are not serious people, just power-hungry.  

### Fit the Second: Trivial COVID-19 Risk as an Excuse to Block Mask Mandates  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-04-29-too-much-too-little-covid-nyt-2.jpg" width="400" height="180" alt="Savage &amp; Murphy @ NYT: Lack of COVID danger as excuse to strike down mask mandates" title="Savage &amp; Murphy @ NYT: Lack of COVID danger as excuse to strike down mask mandates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Let's face it: Republicans hate public health measures like masks and vaccinations,
apparently viewing them as government over-reach trampling on their freedoms.
These are of course "freedoms" to infect _others,_ which is just straight-up crazy, but
that's what they say.  

Recently a federal judge in Florida overturned federal mask mandates.  

Savage &amp; Murphy have a good explainer in the _NYT_. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  
- Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle was appointed by Trump, in spite of the fact that the
  American Bar Association declared her _not qualified_ due to lack of
  experience! <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  
- She decided to go with her gut against the judgement of the CDC, declaring that COVID-19
  was not a serious threat any more.  
- She also adhered to several conservative shibboleths, such as regulatory powers having
  to be specifically enumerated in law, not just "and other measures as the CDC deems
  important."  She would require Congress to use powers of prophecy to foresee future
  needs and explicitly list them in law. This is obvious nonsense on stilts, designed to
  kneecap the government so it cannot even function in any meaningful way.  

Again, the gut feeling of a Republican judge trumped the CDC so a conservative policy
could be forced onto the rest of us.  

## The Weekend Conclusion  

These are not serious people.  They are, however, power-hungry.  They are willing to bend
facts forward (Too much COVID-19? Close the borders!) and backward (Too little COVID-19?
Off with their masks!) in favor of their policies, with no respect for truth whatsoever.
