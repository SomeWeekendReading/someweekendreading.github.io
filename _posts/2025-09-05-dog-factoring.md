Prime factoring is one of the key algorithms to encryption security.  Does it help if you
use a dog?  


## Cryptography and the Venerable TM-82  

So, cryptography.  (No, not "crypto" as in Bitcoin, but good ol' respectable cryptography,
as in sending private messages back and forth.  

Cryptography changed drastically in the late 70s, with the invention of public-key,
trap-door ciphers:  
- It's relatively easy to compute the encrypted form of a message from the cleartext,
  especially since you have the key.  
- It's relatively easy to compute the cleartext of a message from the cryptext, if you
  have the key.
- It's _insanely difficult_ to compute the cleartext of a message from the cryptext without
  the key.
  
So basically we hope that an encryption function is what's called a trap-door function:
it's easy to fall through the trap-door (encrypt with key), it's easy to come back if you
know where the secret catch on the trap-door is (decrypt with key), but it's very hard to
come back through the trap-door if you _don't_ know where the catch is (decrypt without
key).  

It would be ideal if we could prove decryption was an $NP$-hard function, which is
theoretical computer science for something that's hard to compute, but easy to check the
answer.  We hope encryption and decryption with key are polynomial time, but decryption
without key is at least exponential.  

There are no such functions known.  That is, we do not have a formal mathematical proof of
anything.  However, there are _heuristic_ functions that look like this _so far_, i.e.,
nobody's discovered a more efficient decryption step.  (For that matter, we don't even
know for sure if $P = NP$ which would make all this collapse and set loose magic in the
world.  Most knowledgeable people bet that $P \neq NP$, but there are as yet no good
proofs.  Instant fame if you find one, which is why there are so many crank attempts every
year.)  

Prime factoring large (hundreds to low thousand decimal digits) integers is one such problem:
it's hard to find the prime factors, but it's easy-ish to multiply them back to check.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-weekend-lcs-1.jpg" width="400" height="552" alt="Rivest, Shamir, Adelman @ MIT-LCS: TM-82 on the prime factors public-key cryptosystem" title="Rivest, Shamir, Adelman @ MIT-LCS: TM-82 on the prime factors public-key cryptosystem" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
In 1977, Rivest, Shamir &amp; Adelman invented what is now known as the RSA system based
on this. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> The best factoring algorithms back then, and
indeed now, require time exponential in the number of digits of the integer.  (Their
system provides some more interesting features, such as you can publicly disclose an
encryption key to send messages to you, and you can cryptographically sign messages so the
recipients are sure it's from you.  We'll pass over those aspects for today.)  

RSA showed how to exploit this to make an effectively unbreakable system, using modular
exponentiation by repeated squaring.  Over the years, we've had to make the keys longer
and longer as the code-breakers get faster computers, but that's the thing about an
exponential complexity: just a _little_ bit longer key means _much_ harder to break.  

The paper starts out with prophetic words:  

> The era of "electronic mail" may soon be upon us&hellip;  

Yes, soon indeed.  (Yes, I had an ARPANET email address even back then.)  

Still, the US government's reaction was as paranoid as you might expect: they attempted to
declare it retroactively classified, then they declared it a "munition" to prevent its
export (in an era when the net was getting started, _anything_ was deemed exported), and even
threatened the authors and MIT.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  


## Quantum Computers and Factoring  

The RSA algorithm involves picking, in a certain way, a large integer $N$ which is the
product of exactly 2 prime factors $p$ and $q$:  

$$
N = p \times q
$$

You then (approximately; I'm over-simplifying _lots_ of details here, including conditions
on $p$ &amp; $q$, and secure signatures) disclose $N$ publicly so people can encrypt stuff
to send to you, but keep $p$ and $q$ secret.  They are your decryption keys.  

The best factoring algorithms on the best conventional computers are helpless if $N$, $p$,
and $q$ are large enough, like several hundred or a couple thousand digits.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-shor-1.jpg" width="400" height="251" alt="PW Shor @ 35th IEEE Symp on Fndns of CS: Quantum algorithms on discrete logs &amp; factoring" title="PW Shor @ 35th IEEE Symp on Fndns of CS: Quantum algorithms on discrete logs &amp; factoring" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
People quickly began to suspect that doing polynomial-time factoring would require a
quantum computer, which is a different order of beast from regular computers.  Indeed, in
1994 Peter Shor published <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> an algorithm doing exactly
that.  (Wikipedia has [an explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm)
if you don't want to wade through the paper, but both are really only for fans of math.)  

There were no immediate implementations, as there were no immediate quantum computers.  But
people started to get nervous.  RSA is commonly used in encrypted business, diplomatic,
and military communications, at least in the initial key exchange phase.  There's a lot
riding on the confidentiality of those, so&hellip; _nervous._  

Now, the quantum computers of the day were (and still are, really) quite small and
elementary.  So you'd have to start small to demonstrate Shor's algorithm.  That's what
happened:  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-nature-1.jpg" width="400" height="255" alt="Vandersypen, et al. @ Nature: 15 = 3 x 5" title="Vandersypen, et al. @ Nature: 15 = 3 x 5" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- In 2001, Vandersypen and colleagues <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> worked _extremely_
  hard to create a quantum computer having 7 qubits total, consisting each of a single
  spin-1/2 nucleus.  Keeping those from thermalizing with the environment and decohering
  is hard!  These nuclei were interrogated with nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, but
  the system as a whole wouldn't scale to a larger number of qubits.  
  
  Still, they managed to use a quantum computer and Shor's algorithm to prove:  

  $$
  15 = 3 \times 5
  $$

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-nature-photonics-1.jpg" width="400" height="239" alt="Mart&iacute;n-L&oacute;pez, et al. @ Nature Photonics: 21 = 3 x 7" title="Mart&iacute;n-L&oacute;pez, et al. @ Nature Photonics: 21 = 3 x 7" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- There's a lot of effort going on here behind the scenes.  In order to reduce somewhat
  the resource consumption, Mart&iacute;n-L&oacute;pez and colleagues in
  2001 <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> figured out a way to reduce the number of required
  qubits.  Instead of having an $n$-qubit register, they took a single qubit and recycled
  it $n$ times.  The result, as one can see after some math, is about 1/3 the number of
  qubits required by the more conventional Shor protocol.  (Conversely, one could perhaps
  factor numbers with 3x the digits using the same number of qubits?)  
  
  This made their method more likely to be scalable to longer numbers.  
  
  Still, given the constraints of their experimental setup, they were able to use a single
  qubit and &ndash; apparently straining mightily &ndash; came to the conclusion that:  

  $$
  21 = 3 \times 7
  $$

There were maybe 4 or so other attempts around the same time, but I'll spare you the
details.  More modern attempts at quantum computing _might_ be doing better, but it's
still a bit murky to me.  (Also, an attempt to factor 35 was made, but failed.)  

But before you laugh too much (a little is ok), let me remind you that these are not
_engineering_ papers ("Hey, look at this useful thing we made!").  They are, instead,
_science_ papers ("Hey, look what's true about mathematics, quantum mechanics, and
nature!").  They demonstrated very impressively that:  
- Shor's algorithm actually works,  
- Quantum computing is hard, and  
- Scalability in particular is a pain in the rear.  

So the RSA prime factors cipher may not be in immediate danger, but the principle has been
demonstrated.  Now it's a matter of engineering.  

And you know how engineers are.  Especially when they can pull the rug out from under all
the finance people using RSA for encrypted banking transactions.  Who _wouldn't_ like
to annoy the finance bros?  


## Does It Help If You Use a Dog?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-nature-alice-1.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="Martin Gardner's _The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition_" title="Martin Gardner's _The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition_" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
That brings us today's paper.  

Everything up to here is _prolegomena,_ setting up the background for The Main Joke.  Why
bother going through all that just for a joke?  As the eminent science writer Martin
Gardner said, in his _Annotated Alice: Definitive Edition_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, 
from the introduction to the original _Annotated Alice_:

> But no joke is funny unless you see the point of it, and sometimes a point has to be
> explained.  

So now that you know at least the bare bones about RSA ciphers, factorization algorithms,
and the danger to them post by quantum computers&hellip; you're prepared to joke about
them _in the proper fashion!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-crypto-eprint-1.jpg" width="400" height="231" alt="Gutmann &amp; Neuhaus @ Crypto ePrint Archive: Factoring with an 8-bit home computers, an abacus, and a dog" title="Gutmann &amp; Neuhaus @ Crypto ePrint Archive: Factoring with an 8-bit home computers, an abacus, and a dog" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Gutman &amp; Neuhaus <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> have written a very silly paper to
make a very serious point: most of the demonstrations of factoring with quantum computers
have either been physics experiments not yet relevant to cryptography, or have been pretty
much rigged to look more impressive than they really are.  

### The 'Physics Experiments'  

Some of the factorizations of ridiculously simple integers like the above are mostly about
physics experiments of various sorts, say, maintaining quantum coherence in a system of
nuclear spins.  They demonstrate the _feasibility_ of quantum computing by doing Shor's
algorithm on a trivial case.  

As a physics experiment, this is fine and noble.  As a claim about RSA crypto security,
they are ridiculous.  Most such claims were not made by the experimenters, but added by
credulous media.  

Nevertheless, people can't resist "stunt factorizations", in which the problem has been
carefully prepared to have hidden structure to exploit and factorize on trivial amounts of
hardware.  (Analogous, the authors say, to the "force decks" used in card tricks that look
like a full deck of cards, but really contain only one or two.)  
- For example, if $N = p \times q$ where $p$ and $q$ are prime, but differ only
  in a few bits, then $N$ can be factorized by integer square root and brute-force
  search.  

  No real-world RSA system would allow such an $N$, but this inconvenient fact is seldom
  mentioned.  
- Another example is the factorization of 1,099,551,473,989 which in binary begins with 
  100000000000000&hellip; thereby hinting that a game of some sort is afoot.  Such a game
   might be Callas Normal Form, where, if $n \le m$:  
  
  $$
  \left\{
	\begin{align*}
	  p &= 2^{n} - 1 \\
	  q &= 2^{m} + 1
	\end{align*}
  \right.
  $$

  then $N = p \times q$ begins in binary with $m-n$ 0s and ends in $n$ 1 bits.  At that
  point, factorization proceeds more via hijinks than by cleverness.  
  
  Again, this is a case no real-world RSA toolkit would generate.  

There is a paper out this spring and published this summer from a Chinese group claiming
to have used a D-wave quantum computer to solve RSA-2048: factorize 2048-bit $N$ values
into pairs of primes $p$ and $q$. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  

In words attributed to [HL Mencken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken): "Interesting, 
_if true._"  

However, according to Gutmann & Neuhaus, all the examples in the paper are
"sleight-of-hand" numbers.  They were specially chosen so that $p$ and $q$ differ by
either 2 or 6.  So it's perfectly reasonable to take the integer square root of $N$ and
search nearby!  In slightly more detail:  
- There exists a 1024-bit integer $x$ halfway between $p$ and $q$.  
- There exists an integer $d$ such that $p = x - d$ and $q = x + d$.  
- The only choices allowed for $d$ are 1 and 3, depending on whether $p-q$ is 2 or 6,
  respectively.  
  
So $N = pq = (x-d)(x+d) = x^2 - d^2$, so $N + d^2 = x^2$ must be a perfect square.  If $d$
is either 1 or 3, just try $d = 3$ and see if it's a perfect square:  
- Let $x$ be the integer square root of $N + 9$ and $r$ be its remainder.  
- If $r = 0$, then $d = 3$, so the factors are $x-3$ and $x+3$.  
- Else if $r = 8$, then $d = 0$, so the factors are $x-1$ and $x+1$.  
- Else the problem is not one that was rigged for you in advance.  

These tricks are _common._  As the authors say:  

> So far as we have been able to determine, no quantum factorisation has ever factorised a value
> that wasn’t either a carefully-constructed sleight-of-hand number or for which most of the work
> wasn’t done beforehand with a computer in order to transform the problem into a different one
> that could then be readily solved by a physics experiment [23] [10].  

### The VIC-20 8-bit CPU  

Just to rub in the point, the authors show this can be done on a consumer-class
computer _from 1980:_ the Commodore VIC-20.  

This used a 6502 processor (introduced in 1975, which I first encountered in about 1976 or
1977), with:  
- 3 registers of 8 bits each,  
- a data bus 8 bits wide, and  
- a 16 bit address space.  

Typically configured the VIC-20 had 20kb of ROM and a mere 5kb of RAM.  But only
3.5kb of the RAM was available to users, the rest being taken up with system stuff.  The
clock speed was a glacial 1MHz.  (I remember when the Zilog Z-80 came out, at a blistering
5MHz.  That's a mere factor of 1,000 slower clock speed than computers of today.  Given
pipelining and other architectural parallelism tricks, modern hardware is _much_ faster even
than that.)  

The small cases of $15 = 3 \times 5$ and $21 = 3 \times 7$ were done with lookup tables.
The integer square root with remainder algorithm descends from one written by no less a
luminary than John von Neumann himself, for the EDVAC vacuum tube computer in 1945.  

They wrote some code in 6502 assembler, and ran it on an emulator.  The paper points you
to where to get the code, if you're interested.  
- The code was 427 lines long.  
- The ROM image had 794 code and data bytes, 256 were for the number to be factored.  
- The code required 1792 bytes of RAM, which was easy.  

Notably, no multiplication or division operations were required, which is good because the
6502 didn't have that, much less for "bignum" integers with 2,048 bits!

__Results:__ They replicated all 10 results from the D-Wave paper, each taking about 16.5
seconds if one took the number of clock ticks and divided by 1 MHz.  Running it on a
modern laptop took less than a second each.  

__Conclusion:__ The results reported in the D-Wave paper are trivial, since the examples
were chosen via sleight-of-hand to be easily solved.  

The D-Wave paper's authors showed subtle comic taste in their choice to publish this joke,
which I admire &amp; applaud.  However, they did not honestly admit to doing so, which I
deplore: jokes are only funny if you _let people in on the joke!_  

### The Abacus  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-crypto-eprint-abacus.jpg" width="400" height="307" alt="Gutmann &amp; Neuhaus @ Crypto ePrint Archive: an abacus, humorously laid atop a copy of the D-Wave paper" title="Gutmann &amp; Neuhaus @ Crypto ePrint Archive: an abacus, humorously laid atop a copy of the D-Wave paper" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Given that the above-referenced integer square root algorithm was inspired by integer
square roots on an abacus, you can probably guess what comes next.  

They "implemented" the $15 = 3 \times 5$  and $21 = 3 \times 7$ factorizations on an
abacus.  Though, really, since this is done one digit at a time using the user's memory as
a buffer, there was nothing left for the abacus to do.  

This is not (entirely) silly: it points up the triviality of implementation, meaning the
_physics experiments_ doing this were about physics, not cryptography.

The rest, though, is entirely silly.  

They pointed out that to replicate the D-Wave paper's factorization of a (sort of)
RSA-2048 integer, they'd need 616 digits.  Each column of an abacus is one digit, and they
come typically in 9, 11, or 13 digit versions.  Clearly some work on abacus hardware
is required in order to continue the joke:  

> In fact the size of a 616-digit abacus is unpleasant to contemplate, so we leave the
> construction of such a bignum abacus to the reader, or perhaps an enthusiastic
> woodworking hobbyist with a YouTube channel.  

Sounds about right to me.  

### The Dog  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-crypto-eprint-reference-dog.jpg" width="400" height="437" alt="Gutmann &amp; Neuhaus @ Crypto ePrint Archive: Scribble, the 'recently-calibrated reference dog' used in this experiment" title="Gutmann &amp; Neuhaus @ Crypto ePrint Archive: Scribble, the 'recently-calibrated reference dog' used in this experiment" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
In order to further replicate the quantum factorizations of 15 and 21, they employed a
'recently-calibrated reference dog, Scribble', shown here.  

This fine animal is apparently so well-behaved that in general he does not bark.  However,
upon vigorous play, he has been trained to bark 3 times:  

> Having him perform quantum factorization required having his owner play with him with a
> ball in order to encourage him to bark.  It was a special performance just for this
> publication, because he understands the importance of evidence-based science.  

Good dog!  

He apparently failed at factoring 35, because he had learned to bark 3 times.  That's ok,
the first quantum factoring attempt on 35 failed, too.  

The RSA-2048 candidates proposed in the D-Wave paper were beyond the scope of the dog.  

No dogs were harmed in the course of this research:  

> According to most Codes of Ethics, Scribble's contribution to this paper does not rise
> to the level where he is required to be listed as co-author.  However since he was a
> participant in the work rather than the subject of an experiment his contributions are
> exempt from review board approval.  

In fact, as far as reproducibility of this research, they correctly note one difficulty:  

> Finally, the apparatus for the canine-based factorization may be obtained from any
> animal shelter.  Although our experiment used a Staffy, almost any dog breed should be
> suitable, although smaller yappy dogs may over-report values.  

### The Point  

Almost all the reports of quantum factorization are either notable as physics experiments
as yet irrelevant to cryptography, or as "stunt factorizations" using sham keys that no
RSA cryptography system would permit.  

The authors present several sensible criteria for factorization claims going forward.
They're about what you think:  
- the factors should be chose sensibly by the criteria used in crypto (of which there are
  several),  
- the experiment should be _blinded_ (the factoring researchers are not permitted to know
  the number in advance, nor the solution until they find it), and  
- the process should be repeated on 10 different values chosen independently from the
  experimenters, to show reproducibility.  

The real question to me is: how do papers like the sham factorizations and the sleight of
hand D-Wave paper get published?  Shouldn't at least one of the referees have some
cryptography background to check for things like this?  Shouldn't there be a standard
registry of appropriately chosen factoring problems, whose solutions are not revealed
until someone solves them?  

The thing about common sense is that it's so _uncommon!_  


## Chicken  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yL_-1d9OSdk?si=hstp4lsECVQZo9gn" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
Sometimes, when reading a deliberately silly paper, one should calibrate it against The
Standards.  

One such standard is Doug Zongker's famous "Chicken" paper &amp; talk <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>,
from 2006-2007.  Though published in the venerable _Annals of Improbable Research_, it was
actually presented at a AAAS conference in 2007 (admittedly in the humor section, which is
only fitting).  

He mocks the _form_ of a technical talk, without having the least bit of _content._  He
shows many graphs, tables, and equations &ndash; all without meaning.  He only says the
word "chicken", though with tone of voice to emphasize Very Important Points about
chickens.  

Be sure to stick around for the end of the video, when during the question period, someone
asks a question using _only_ the word chicken&hellip; and Zongker has a pre-prepared
response slide just in case somebody did that.  Now _that's_ preparedness surrealism!  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-weekend-dog.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="The Ch&acirc;teau Weekend 'dog' is actually a fox" title="The Ch&acirc;teau Weekend 'dog' is actually a fox" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-05-dog-factoring-weekend-publisher-disapproves.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="The Weekend Publisher disapproves of dogs of all sorts, not just for crypto security reasons" title="The Weekend Publisher disapproves of dogs of all sorts, not just for crypto security reasons" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Dog factoring is not really a thing, of course, beyond satire.  (Though it _is_ good
satire!)  

But at Chez Weekend, we're less dog-folk and more cat-folk.  So far, attempts to get the 2
cats to factorize integers have been unsuccessful.  

Still, there are a few members of family _Canidae_ frequenting the Ch&acirc;teau Weekend grounds
and gardens, shown here.  It appears to be a wild fox, though a bit skinny.  We've seen
several of them running around the garden, playing cutely.  They seem to have gotten
control of the _enormous_ rabbit population, and the otherwise adorable-but-ignorable chipmunks.  The
wild turkeys, several times fox-sized, are unlikely prey but still spooked.  (Wild turkeys
_can_ fly, just&hellip; not very well.)  

As you can see here, the Weekend Publisher (and the Assistant Weekend Publisher, not
shown) disapproves of dogs of all sorts,
[August _dies caniculares_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_days) or not.  (His opinions on factoring
are as yet unknown.)  

But all of us here are agreed: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/ceterum-censeo/)

<a id="fn2">2</a>: A couple weird stories:  

- In the summer of 1977, the RSA algorithm was discussed in _Scientific American_, in
  Martin Gardner's famous "Mathematical Games" column.  I was an avid reader of that
  column in those days, and since I was entering MIT in fall 1977 as a physics grad
  student, I thought I'd pick up a copy of TM-82 for recreational reading.  
  
  When I went to the publications office to ask for one, I got a deeply suspicious look,
  and questions like: "Are you an MIT affiliate?"  And: "What are you going to do with it
  if I give it to you?"  All very weird, but it turned out the Institute was fighting the
  US government in its effort to strangle the whole thing, and had temporarily stopped
  giving it out.  
  
  I thought I looked like a scruffy grad student and not a spy, but whatever.  
  
  But&hellip; they helpfully added that I could put my name on a waiting list to get it
  "when things clear up".  Being young &amp; na&iuml;ve, I did so.  
  
  Eventually, I got the paper, after maybe 3-4 months.  
  
  But in the meantime, some weird stuff happened, since I was apparently now on some very
  weird lists.  I had a girlfriend in those days (yes, that's weird too, given my lack of
  social skills, but it's not the weird part of _this_ story), whom I would call
  periodically long-distance (also a weird thing of those bygone days).
  
  Then one day her dormitory phone wouldn't connect.  She eventually got it repaired by
  her university, but the repair guy said _there was a part missing._  Apparently somebody had
  entered her room, taken the phone apart, decided it was too old to mess with, and put it
  back together incompetently.  
  
  Is that probable attempt at bugging her phone related to my wanting a copy of an
  encryption paper?  Sure feels like it!  
  
  So maybe in some FBI/CIA/DSA database, there's an entry about me from September 1977.  
  
- On the subject of old phones: MIT had a system called "dorm-phone", which was
  _ancient_.  It didn't really connect to the outside world, only to Institute phones.  It
  was run through a relay rack in the basement of my graduate dorm.  You could go down
  there and stand outside the door to the phone equipment room, hearing the relays go
  "clacketa-clacketa".  
  
  Years later, a colleague told me a weird phone story of when _he_ first arrived at MIT.  
  
  Seeing the ancient dorm-phone in his room, he correctly guessed that he could do
  hook-flash dialing: you rhythmically tap the hang-up buttons on the hook, with a short
  pause between digits.  Like the 20mA current loop machinery in the dial, this feels to
  the phone switch like the rotary dial sliding over the contacts.  So he made a quick
  call to a friend in the dorm, smiled at the oddity, and hung up.  
  
  A moment later, his phone rang.  The conversation went like this:  
  
  > Mysterious angry voice: Does your phone have a __dial__ on it?!  
  > My colleague: Uh&hellip; yes?  
  > Mysterious angry voice: Then __use__ it!  
  
  Somebody had been in the relay room at the time, and hear the relays not going gently
  "clacketa-clacketa", but "SLAM!  SLAM!".  This sort of thing is hard on those ancient
  relays, so he worked back from the relays to the source number and expressed his fervent
  desire that this abuse come to an end.  (Possibly a Bad Word _might_ have been used.)  
  
  My colleague then realized that as a 70s-era phone hacker, he was far from unique in
  that environment. [↩](#fn2a)
