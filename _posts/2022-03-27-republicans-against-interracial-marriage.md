A US Senator says he would allow states to ban interracial marriage.  _What?!_  


## Apparently they're coming for my marriage now?

In 1967, the US Supreme Court issued a decision called _Loving v Virginia:_ state-level bans
on interracial marriage were ruled unconstitutional.  Marry how you like, regardless of
race.  Up until today, I was dismayed that my marriage would have been forbidden at the
state level in recent times, within my personal memory.  

Today it got worse.  Republican Senator Mike Braun of Indiana claimed, multiple times,that he felt that case was decided wrongly and states should be able to ban marriage on the basis of race. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

In the eternal fashion of politicians caught voicing their id, he claimed to have been
either misquoted or to have misunderstood the question.  The quote seems pretty clear, and
if he couldn't understand a clear question when repeated multiple times in variant
forms&hellip; well, then he's not smart enough to tie his own shoes, let alone be a
US Senator.  

He went on to claim _Griswold v Connecticut_ was decided wrongly: that states should be
able to make birth control illegal!  He not only doesn't want my type of marriage to
exist, he worries about condoms in the hands of the wrong people.  

And of _course_ he wants states to legislate over every uterus, since he's opposed to _Roe
v Wade_ legalizing abortion.  

In an attempt to be fair, there _has_ been some backlash in Indiana.  A little.  While I
have family connections to Indiana, it's clear this a difficult place to be if the citizenry can
attempt to shrug this off.  I mean, the guy said he's not racist, he _just_ wants states to
be able to abolish interracial marriage, right?  

Jamelle Bouie, whom [we have quoted favorably here before]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccine-waste/#scare-headlines-from-the-mathematically-illiterate), has the right of the matter, at the _NYT:_
why _are_ we still debating interracial marriage in 2022?!  Gotta say: Bouie kept his temper
better than I've kept mine.  His summary:  

> Senator Braun's mistake was not that he misunderstood the question; it's that he
> understood it all too well. The world he and his colleagues are working toward is one in
> which the national government defers the question of civil and political rights to the
> states. And it is in the states, free from federal oversight, where people like Braun
> can exercise real control over what you might do, how you might live and who you might
> love. __It's freedom for some and obedience for the rest.__  

States don't get to legislate civil rights.  _Nobody_ gets to legislate against rights!
Anything that can be controlled by a legislature is not a right: it's a _privilege_,
subject to retraction by majority whim.  Rights are what _resists_ that kind of attack.  


## Ok, but that's just one weird guy, right?  

No, it's not _just_ some gormless twit who happened to blurt out his true thoughts in
public.  It's "endemic", to use a word the right doesn't seem to grok either.

Here by way of immediate example the same day is a minor Republican, one Robert Foster of
Mississippi, caught saying the quiet part out loud. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> He's
already against civil rights for trans people.  He also doesn't seem to be able to
distinguish between a trans person and a child sex predator, accusing them all of
"grooming" school-age children for sexual abuse.

(This is not uncommon among conservatives.  Yesterday Q-anon lunatic US Representative
Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia warned US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigeige and
his husband to "stay out of our girl's bathrooms".  <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
She not only can't tell the difference
between a married gay couple vs pedophiles, but she somehow thinks they have an
inexplicable interest in girls, underage ones at that.  This is a _florid_ display of
ignorance and paranoia, regrettably typical of modern Republicans.)  

Foster's proposed remedy: have trans people and their supporters _murdered_ by firing squads.  

He has a number of other positions that are equally charming.  

Now, here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend we're an interracial marriage _and_ we support full
civil rights for all sorts of people.  So now the American conservatives not only want to
annul our marriage, but then _murder_ us?  And they say this _openly?_  

We're not the ones who need to learn civility, here.  Or learn how to be decent human
beings, for that matter.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Look, if you're still a Republican, just face it: this is your party's brand now.
They're fascist, racist, homophobic, sexist, anti-intellectual, and authoritarians who
tried to subvert a US presidential election.  

Get out while you still can.
