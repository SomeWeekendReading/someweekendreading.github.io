[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) what I thought of ZDogg's
explanation of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant.  My first thought was "ZDogg _who?_  Is that a
rapper or something?"  My final thought was that the guy's eminently reasonable, eloquent,
and kind.  


## Getting past the name "ZDogg"  

ZDogg?  Really?  Isn't that some rapper?  Why should I listen to a rapper's opinions about
COVID-19?  (Nothing against rap itself: it's not to my taste, but then it's not _trying_ to
be to my taste.  If it's to your taste, then by all means enjoy.)  My first thought
here was: there is little point into listening to this, unless it's just for the surrealism
of it all.  

And I'm a sucker for surrealism.  

So I watched the esteemed ZDoggMD's treatment of the Delta variant of 
SARS-CoV-2. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

And I am _delighted_ to report that I was utterly wrong!  (That's when you learn things,
when you admit you were wrong.)  The gentleman in question, one Zubin Damania MD, is a
former hospitalist at Stanford who occasionally makes videos about what _really_ goes on
in healthcare and several other subjects.  

I haven't plumbed the depths of his YouTube channel, but I'm very favorably impressed by
his analysis of the Delta variant: calm, evidence-based, thinking like a scientist&hellip;
and just a bit of sarcasm.  (And occasionally more than a bit profane: that's a generational thing
where I'm more sensitive to language than the youngs.  So just never mind me on that subject.)

As to my prejudice (and let's face it, my reaction was prejudice) about his chosen 
_nom de Tube_: I'm old, he's young, and elders have been grumping about youngsters
forever.  For example:  

> "Times are bad. Children no longer obey their parents, and everyone is writing a book."  
>  
> &mdash; attributed to [Marcus Tullius Cicero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero) in 43BCE, but
> almost certainly apocryphally so, as nobody cites a particular source, and some give
> other authors dating improbably back to 4000BCE. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  
>  
> Still&hellip; style points for quality snark?  

While it's doubtful Cicero ever said that, being the curmudgeon that he was, he probably
would have said it if he'd thought about it.  So I promise to stop being a curmudgeon
about ZDoggMD and listen to what he has to say.  


## So, ZDogg, whatta ya got for me?

Some thoughts about the video:  
- From the summary: "Delta variant&hellip; explained by a doctor with precisely 97.5% less
  drama".  Oh, yeah.  I'm in already!  
- "Man, every time I think I get to stop talking about COVID, they keep pulling me back
  in."  I haven't seen [_The Godfather_ part anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNQHhD-cdEY), 
  but&hellip; yeah.  I'm tired of COVID, tired of writing about COVID, tired of the
  knuckleheadery around COVID, and want to write about _almost anything but COVID_.
  Starting to like this guy ZDogg.  
- Then he does a nice 2 paragraph explanation of what Delta (aka B.1.617.2) is, how
  evolution works, and why you should care.  Masterful public science communication.  
- The most important bit: "First of all, you shouldn’t panic about Delta, period. &hellip;
  So you’re talking like 88%, 94% against hospitalization, with Delta variant and Pfizer
  &hellip;".  Yes: _if you're vaccinated._  Which you should be.  
- "Are you gonna die or be hospitalized? And the answer is, probably not. In fact, with
  the vaccine, there’s a, it’s really unlikely. Most of the people who are hospitalized
  and dying currently are unvaccinated&hellip;" _Absolutely!_  So&hellip; _get
  vaccinated!_  Please don't die.  
- "&hellip; but here is the bottom line about what to think about Delta. Don’t think about
  it if you’re vaccinated."  Yes: the sheer mental stress relief alone is worth the
  vaccination, but the part about _not dying_ is a nice little bonus, no?  
- "Any adult who can be vaccinated, in my mind, should be, but if you have your own
  reasons for not being, I don’t think anyone should shame you or force you."  Ok, gonna
  disagree here.  People who have medical reasons for not being vaccinated are exceptions,
  and all the rest of us should care for them to preserve their lives.  But if shaming
  people who are unvaccinated for reasons of superstition, ignorance, or conspiracy
  theories  gets them vaccinated, then that _saves a life._  And since 
  [_pikuach nefesh_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh), literally "watching
  over a soul", is the highest principle in my personal version of my religion, shaming is
  an appropriate tool here if it _saves a life._  
- __The summary:__ "Variants, shmariants, get your vaccine, and relax.  Or don’t, and
  decide whether you wanna relax or not.  But I don’t wanna hear about it anymore, okay?"
  I literally could not have said it better myself.  
  
So: ok, a couple points of disagreement, but that's normal.  He's a very sensible fellow!

Let's see what he's got to say about his decision to get his family vaccinated.  Short
&amp; sweet, to the point, and&hellip; a bit profane in spots.  But I'm an old guy, so
ignore me on that.  Pay attention to the rest.  

Again, yeah: thumbs up from me.  Enough to make me subscribe to his channel, anyway.
We'll see how the rest of his stuff goes down.
