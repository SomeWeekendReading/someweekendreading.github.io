So&hellip; the 4th of July, here in the US?  


## American Independence Day, Chez Weekend  

[Yes, I'm posting the next day.  Just deal with it, ok?]  

Chez Weekend, we didn't make too big a deal out of the holiday.  Too many of our friends
were out of town to invite people over, so it was just us and the cats.

### _In hydrangeae, veritas_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-04-2024-Jul-04-globe-1.jpg" width="400" height="422" alt="Larson @ Globe: Why it's been a remarkable year for hydrangeas in New England" title="Larson @ Globe: Why it's been a remarkable year for hydrangeas in New England" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-04-2024-Jul-04-globe-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-04-2024-Jul-04-globe-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="266" alt="Larson/Tlumacki @ Globe: Spectacular hydrangeas in front of J Random Law Firm" title="Larson/Tlumacki @ Globe: Spectacular hydrangeas in front of J Random Law Firm" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
It appears that this is a _monster_ year for hydrangeas in New England.  There are _so
many_ flowers, though mostly of moderate size.  The venerable _Globe_ has taken
Official Notice <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, and explained that it is due to the mild
winter last year.  (The pictures in the article are worth your time, so by all means click
through the reference below.  The 2nd photo shown here &ndash; click to embiggen &ndash;
is not a botanical display or gardening club; it's just some a planting in front of J
Random Law Firm.)   

Apparently hydrangeas, in a fit of ill-planned reproductive exuberance, set buds in the
autumn.  Only the ones that survive winter get to bloom the next summer.  Now, in some
respects, last winter was a _complete disaster_ here, with almost no snow at all and
obscenely warm.  (Yes, climate change is coming for us all.)  This means most of the
hydrangea buds survived, making a fantastic display this summer.  (Though, as is my wont,
I mutter darkly about what _other_ ecological changes are less visible and far less
pretty.)

The word comes from Greek _hydros_ + _angos_ = water jar; no idea what to make of that
other than that they need a lot of water.  Victorian "flower language" was pretty
negative: they were "boastful", or symbolized the "romantically frigid".  (_Victorians!_
Whaddaya gonna do?)  

Japanese, on the other hand, associate them with apologies and gratitude for forgiveness,
which is a bit better.  There's apparently some legend, which I am too lazy to track down,
that some emperor or other gave hydrangeas (_ajisai_) to the family of a woman he loved
but had neglected.  Still kinda not a happy flower?  

But let us put aside other people's weird ideas about flowers, and contemplate our very
own weird ideas about flowers!  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-04-2024-Jul-04-weekend-hydrangeae.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-04-2024-Jul-04-weekend-hydrangeae-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="The Weekend Hydrangeae" title="The Weekend Hydrangeae" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The Weekend Hydrangea Team, shown here, agrees firmly.  Here they are growing in a
right-angled formation next to the neighbor's garage, making a little corner into which one
can nestle amongst the flowers and&hellip; well, _blog._  

It's enough to make me think of Tennyson's poem _The Lady of Shalott_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
in which the titular Lady is surrounded by flowers (though without the four gray walls and
four gray towers of a keep):  

> Four gray walls, and four gray towers  
> Overlook a space of flowers,  
> And the silent isle imbowers  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lady of Shalott.  
> &mdash; Tennyson, __The Lady of Shalott__ (1832), Part I, ll. 15 &ndash; 18.  

Then again, the Lady in that poem dies almost immediately, so perhaps I should be content
with an analogy which is _partial_ at best.  (As an aging cis-het male nerd, my credentials
to be called "Lady" are quite dubious, anyway.)  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DgaEd5hIxzI?si=kseVYXJnp59o6xV6" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
Loreena McKennitt has a spectacular setting of that poem to music.  I still recall the
first time I heard it on the radio (yes, Boston had folk/Celtic radio in those days).  It
absolutely hit me like a ton of bricks, pinning me to my bed when I was supposed to be
dressing to go somewhere.  It very much captures the mournful atmosphere.  We often think
of Arthuriana as adventurous, but it's often more tragic than the surface gives
appearance.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/The_Lady_of_Shalott_by_William_Holman_Hunt,_c._1890-1905,_oil_on_canvas_-_Wadsworth_Atheneum_-_Hartford,_CT_-_DSC05541.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/The_Lady_of_Shalott_by_William_Holman_Hunt,_c._1890-1905,_oil_on_canvas_-_Wadsworth_Atheneum_-_Hartford,_CT_-_DSC05541-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="509" alt="Wm Holman Hunt: The Lady of Shalott, Wadsworth Atheneum via Wikipedia" title="Wm Holman Hunt: The Lady of Shalott, Wadsworth Atheneum via Wikipedia" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Speaking of being hit by tons of bricks, there's an absolutely gorgeous painting inspired
by the poem by the pre-Raphaelite painter William Holman Hunt, shown
here. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> (Actually there are several, this just happens to
be my particular ton of bricks.  Apparently my education involved standing underneath
rather a _lot_ of bricks.)  

I remember first encountering it in poster-form in a bookstore in the late 1970s.  Of
course I bought a copy, and just sat there for hours, wondering
_what in the world is going on here?_  (I mean, really: that's the only question that ever
matters, right?)  There's just so much: the hair flying in the air, some
bird wrapping yarn around her, the wearing of Japanese wooden sandals (indoors!), the
cracked mirror, the inexplicable samovar, the tapestry, the astronomical and religious wall
art, &hellip;  I could make up story after story about it, and I _loved_ that.  

I was also (momentarily) quite angry when, years later, a musicologist I was then dating
sagely but inadvisably told me the story of the Tennyson poem!  All those lovely
imaginative stories collapsed like a house of burning tissues, leaving only the One True
Canonical Arthurian reference.  It was like the scene in JB Cabell's _Something About
Eve_, [chapter 37](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69779/pg69779-images.html#ch37:~:text=For%20one%20matter%2C%20after,to%20those%20lights%20alone.) <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>
on demolishing one's beautiful ideas about the world with actual cruel observation:  

> For one matter, after dark, Antan always displayed eight lights, six of them grouped
> together in the middle of the vista with the general effect of a cross, and the other two
> showing much farther off to the northwest. About those never-varying huge lights Gerald
> had formed at least twenty delightful theories, all plausible as long as you remained upon
> Mispec Moor, whereas if you went to Antan not more at most than one of these theories
> could prove true.  
> 
> To go to Antan thus meant the destruction of no less than nineteen rather beautiful ideas
> as to those lights alone.  

(This attitude, while poetic, is of course the _opposite_ of the attitude of a true
scientist.  We must _always_ acknowledge the superiority of experimental fact over
theoretical model, no matter how beautiful.  And tragic.)  

The painting is currently in the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford CT (apparently the oldest
art museum in the US).  Purely by a coincidence some quarter century ago, the Weekend
Editrix and I were on a short vacation and happened into the Atheneum.  I recall turning a
corner and this giant _thing_ hit me in the face, _again._ It's quite large, in addition
to being artistically striking.  (I recall it being in a stairwell, of all places, but
that can't possibly be correct.  Please, any Atheneum folk who read this, say it ain't
so!)  I stopped suddenly, actually lost my balance from the impact, and had to sit down
for a minute.  I kinda got stuck there for a while, until the Weekend Editrix pulled me
out.  


### Food!  

Ok, enough woolgathering inspired by flowers.  July 4th in the US, while ostensibly about
independence, is also about food.  Specifically, grilled/barbecued food in the part of the
US where I grew up.  

We kept it pretty simple: a steak, a salad, Japanese rice, and a puff pastry fruit tart.  

Well, _mostly_ that simple:  
- We spent literally 5 hours cleaning the grill, removing the weather cover and degreasing
  it from neglecting cleanings last year.  It's a serious disincentive to using a grill;
  why are they all made difficult to clean, with grease in inconvenient spots, heavy parts
  to move, and a lot of bending over or kneeling by elderly bodies?  
- I did a New York steak in the _sous vide_ for some hours, after dry-brining with
  aji-no-moto (MSG), garlic powder, fresh black pepper.  Oh, and some butter, too.
  - Then it went on the newly cleaned grill for a quick sear (except I forgot how long the
    grill takes to warm up).  
  - I made a quick pan sauce: cooking some fresh mashed garlic in butter, deglazed with
    some cooking sake and the _sous vide_ liquid, added some black pepper and Japanese
    shoyu, thickenes very slightly with some cornstarch and chicken broth.  (We were out of
    beef broth, to my disappointment.)  
  - Slice, sauce, and serve.  
- The salad and rice were about what you imagine.  
- The dessert consisted of blind-baking some frozen puff pastry with an egg wash and
  coarse decorating sugar, then later  filling with a Bavarian cr&ecirc;me constructed by the
  Weekend Editrix and topped with thinly sliced, _very_ ripe mangoes, peaches, and blueberries.  

All told: quite satisfactory.  But&hellip; a bit more work than our aging bodies want to
do just for ourselves.  We really needed guests to provide motivation!  

### The ironically proper symbolism of fireworks  

Later in the evening, we adjourned to the condo of some friends who have a Boston condo
with a spectacular view of the Esplanade, where the Pops concert and the fireworks display
happen.  

For those uninitiated in Boston lore: in summer, the Boston Symphony Orchestra divides
itself &ndash; somehow &ndash; into some players who decamp for Tanglewood, and others who
become the Boston Pops, so yclept because they play more "popular" music.  (As do those at
Tangle wood; no, none of this makes much sense.)  The Pops traditionally does a July 4th
concert on the Esplanade at the Hatch Shell, beside the Charles River in Boston.  The
program is a selection of popular music, with famous visiting performers, and a few bits of
light classical music.  

It always ends with a big, flashy performance of Tchaikovsky's _1812 Overture_.  (Yes,
that's about Russians pushing the Napoleonic army out of Moscow in 1812, not anything to
do with the US in 1776.  See above, about how "none of this makes sense".  It is
spectacular anyway, in the sense of "spectacle.")  By "big, flashy" performance, I mean it
involves actual cannon fire, followed by a gargantuan fireworks display which is somewhat
coordinated with the music.  

This is a _big deal:_ [the latest estimate was 400,000 people in attendance](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/boston-pops-july-4th-fireworks-esplanade/#:~:text=Celebrating%2050th%20year&text=Now%20for%20five%20decades%20strong,epic%20night%20celebrating%20our%20country.) on both sides of the river.
So if you're not crowd-tolerant, this is not for you.  (When I was in grad school, we'd
just climb up the stairs to the roof of our dorm to watch, which was ok.)

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-04-fireworks-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-04-fireworks-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Boston Pops fireworks, as seen from friends' balcony nearby" title="Boston Pops fireworks, as seen from friends' balcony nearby" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
This year, we repaired to the balcony of our friends with their spectacular condo and its
spectacular view.  Even so, we had to think carefully about how to get there in time,
given the need to get through 400,000 of our closest neighbors!  

The picture here shows just one smallish firework, because it's difficult to capture both
the dynamic range of lighting with a camera, not to mention the guttural "boom!" felt in
one's chest.  The hotel to the lower left had LED lights displaying a red/white/blue
chaser, which we presume to be in honor of the French tricolor for Bastille day coming up
in a couple weeks, no?  It also had a crowd on the roof, apparently operating a drone
which was doing crazy stuff like flying into the fireworks; I'd really like to see the
video of that &ndash; I've seen it done, but I always wonder how the drone survives.  

Photos of course do this an injustice: the shock of bright colors at night followed by a
boom reverberating in one's rib cage is difficult to convey in pixels.  Indeed, the origin
of the choice to use fireworks (a Chinese invention long ago) to celebrate important
occasions.  Indeed, the American National Anthem commemorates the 1814 Battle of Baltimore
against the British at Fort McHenry, noting the Congreve rockets <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
being fired.  (This all gets tangled up in the American mind with the Revolution, but the
fireworks celebrate survival in both cases.)  

Congreve rockets were, by modern standards, essentially terror weapons: they couldn't be
aimed very much, and were good mostly for tasks like "blow up something vaguely over
_there,_ I don't care exactly what."  They must have been, indeed, terrifying: they could
deliver from 20 - 300 pounds of explosive as far as 2000 yards (though the precise
targeting was doubtful).  They had no range advantage over artillery, but could
be fired faster.  

They remind me of the HAMAS rockets used as terror weapons with no guidance systems
against Israel, i.e., "break stuff and kill people over there, not particular about
exactly what").  

So fireworks are a proper re-imagining of a terror weapon: changing its memory from at
murderous terror weapon to an occasion for celebration.  I can live with that!  (Especially
if we could learn to skip the war part, and just move on to the celebration part.)  

The Swiss do it better!  In their Sonderbundskrieg <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>, some
Catholic cantons banded together ("Sonderbund" is something like "separate alliance") and
attempted to secede from Switzerland in 1847.  This war lasted all of 26 days, with
victory to the united Swiss forces.  The casualty rate was exceptionally low, around 100
&ndash; 120 dead all totaled.

Notably, General Guillaume Henri Dufour, leading the Swiss Federal Army, _refused_ the
offer of Congreve rockets, as he intended to:  

> &hellip;avoid as far as possible to give this war a violent character which cannot but
> harm our cause.  

Dufour _understood the necessity of restraint,_ avoiding terror weapons against his brothers
and sisters who would soon enough become once again his fellow citizens.  

That, ladies and gentlemen, is _how it is done!_  

### Some wise words of advice from the past  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-04-2024-Jul-04-Frederick-Douglass-in-1852.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-07-04-2024-Jul-04-Frederick-Douglass-in-1852-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="554" alt="Frederick Douglass in 1852" title="Frederick Douglass in 1852" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
In the US, we like to yell a lot about freedom and patriotism on the 4th.  It's good,
therefore, to remember that our history in granting freedom to all of our people has been
patchy at best.  Racial minorities, sexual minorities, ethnic minorities, most women,
people who are poor&hellip; all these have faced struggles.  We've gotten better over
time, but right now we face an ascendant right/fascist fashion who seek to take all that
back.  

So as a remedy, let's listen to [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass),
a Black American who escaped slavery and demonstrated great intellectual and social
prowess by becoming a social reformer, abolitionist, orator, writer, and statesman.  

On 1852-Jul-05, he was asked to address his then hometown, Rochester New York on the
subject of the meaning of the 4th of July to the slave and the former
slave. <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  The whole address is worth your time.  After
acknowledging that Americans chafed under the unjust rule of the Crown, he points out
forcefully that enslaved people also chafe under unjust rule of slavers.  His
condemnation reminds me of the first chapter of Isaiah:  

> What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July? I answer: a day that reveals to him,
> more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the
> constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy
> license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty
> and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass fronted impudence; your shouts of
> liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers and hymns, your sermons and
> thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast,
> fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy &ndash; a thin veil to cover up crimes which would
> disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices,
> more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very
> hour.  

Like Isaiah 1, Douglass also believes in redemption.  We can become reacquainted with
our better natures.  We can learn to do better for each other.  

_That_ passion for the freedom of _everyone_ is a something we should revere, even as it
accuses us, and we repent.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

We note with some interest that the UK had their election on July 4th (American
Independence Day) while the American election will be on Guy Fawkes Day (a British holiday
commemorating the _failure_ of a plan to blow up Parliament).  

They have checked their descent into right-wing madness; let us hope that we do the same, as well.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/king-charles-absolute-monarch-beheaded.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/king-charles-absolute-monarch-beheaded-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="534" alt="Charles I: beheaded 10 days after asserting kingly right to make war on parliament" title="Charles I: beheaded 10 days after asserting kingly right to make war on parliament" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
We're wrestling in the US with a right wing, now ensconced in our Supreme Court, that
wishes their views to be above the law.  They have conjured out of airy nothing an
absolute immunity that makes it maddeningly difficult to convict Trump of his obvious
crimes.  

This week I saw (somewhere!) the image here, portraying the British King 
[Charles I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England).  He
was a fan of the divine right of kings, and eventually made war on Parliament in the
English Civil War.  He was defeated, and tried for this crime.  His lawyers asserted that
as king, he had absolute sovereign immunity, and could not be tried for anything, ever.  Parliament
and the court disagreed with sufficient vehemence that he was convicted, sentenced to death, and
beheaded.  

The Republican extremists argue about absolute immunity for Trump.  These arguments are,
as we see from history, as dangerous as they are stupid.  

Do I really need to add this?  Cato the Elder kept at it until Carthage was destroyed, so
apparently the answer is 'yes': [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)
