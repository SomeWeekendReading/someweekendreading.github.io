Good news: the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, aka 'Spikevax', is now fully FDA-approved!  


## Full FDA approval  

[Last August, we noted with full approval]({{ site.baseurl }}/pfizer-vaccine-approved/) the full approval of Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, which we are apparently supposed to call comirnaty/tozinameran.

Today came the very welcome news that the US FDA has granted full approval for the BLA
of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine! <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

So probably we should stop calling it "the Moderna vaccine" and instead start using its
names?  Because everything medical in the US has to be complicated, it has two: the
generic name is elasomeran, and the commercial copyrighted name owned by Moderna is simply
marvelous: [Spikevax]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccine-names/#trade-names-for-covid-19-vaccines)!  

(Here at Chez Weekend, we also approve.  Though there's no reason for you to care about
that.)  

We had 
[previously wondered](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/covid-vaccine-full-approval/#the-weekend-conclusion)
what the long delay in approval was, since Pfizer had filed the application in May, and
Moderna had done so in June.  Apparently the answer is the required 6 months of follow-up
safety data for Pfizer, and even more for Moderna, for no discerible reason.  Still, the
trial started last summer, so it's been a year and a half.  There's something about why it
took 12 months to get the 6 months of safety data that we obviously don't understand.
Especially why it took 6 months _longer_ for Moderna; perhaps Pfizer, being a big pharma
company, just knows better how to massage the FDA?  

Incidentally, this is the _very first approval_ for a Moderna drug.  (And I can say "drug"
now, not "compound", or "candidate", or &hellip;  And it frees up a lot of insurance
bureaucracy around reimbursement.)  

Some interesting facts and possible consequences:  
- Moderna still hasn't been approved for people under 18 years of age.  They applied for
  approval last June, but the FDA told them to take a deeper look at myocarditis and
  pericarditis risks.  
- Moderna is delaying their filing for ages 6 - 11, pending the FDA evaluation of the
  myocarditis results in ages 12 - 18.  
- Given that a good fraction of the
  [10 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses given]({{ site.baseurl }}/ten-billionth-dose/)
  are Moderna, can we reduce vaccine "hesitancy" among the less lunatic fraction of the
  unvaccinated?    We can start having intelligent conversations about vaccine mandates,
  _of approved vaccines,_ in schools, universities, workplaces, and so on.  

Approved.  That's a good word, isn't it?
