Good news: the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, aka 'Spikevax', is now fully FDA-approved!  


## Full FDA approval  

[Last August, we noted our Full Weekend Approval]({{ site.baseurl }}/pfizer-vaccine-approved/) of the full FDA approval of Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, which we are apparently supposed to call comirnaty/tozinameran.

Today came the very welcome news that the US FDA has granted full approval for the BLA
of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine! <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

So probably we should stop calling it "the Moderna vaccine" and instead start using its
names?  Because everything medical in the US has to be complicated, it has two: the
generic name is elasomeran, and the commercial copyrighted name owned by Moderna is simply
marvelous: [Spikevax]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccine-names/#trade-names-for-covid-19-vaccines)!  

(Here at Chez Weekend, we also approve.  Though there's no reason for you to care about
that.)  

We had 
[previously wondered](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/covid-vaccine-full-approval/#the-weekend-conclusion)
what the long delay in approval was, since Pfizer had filed the application in May, and
Moderna had done so in June.  Apparently the answer is the required 6 months of follow-up
safety data for Pfizer, and even more for Moderna, for no discerible reason.  Still, the
trial started last summer, so it's been a year and a half.  There's something about why it
took 12 months to get the 6 months of safety data that we obviously don't understand.
Especially why it took 6 months _longer_ for Moderna; perhaps Pfizer, being a big pharma
company, just knows better how to massage the FDA?  

Incidentally, this is the _very first approval_ for a Moderna drug.  (And I can say "drug"
now, not "compound", or "candidate", or &hellip;  And it frees up a lot of insurance
bureaucracy around reimbursement.)  

Some interesting facts and possible consequences:  
- Moderna still hasn't been approved for people under 18 years of age.  They applied for
  approval last June, but the FDA told them to take a deeper look at myocarditis and
  pericarditis risks.  
- Moderna is delaying their filing for ages 6 - 11, pending the FDA evaluation of the
  myocarditis results in ages 12 - 18.  
- Given that a good fraction of the
  [10 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses given]({{ site.baseurl }}/ten-billionth-dose/)
  are Moderna, can we reduce vaccine "hesitancy" among the less lunatic fraction of the
  unvaccinated?    We can start having intelligent conversations about vaccine mandates,
  _of approved vaccines,_ in schools, universities, workplaces, and so on.  

'Approved'.  That's a good word, isn't it?  


## Addendum 2022-Feb-05: CDC also approves  

In an interesting display of speed, just 4 days later _Reuters_ reports that the CDC's
Advisory Committee on Immunization Policy (ACIP) met and also voted full approval for
Spikevax in clinical use for individuals over age 18. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
The details and slide presentations to the ACIP are public, and somewhat interesting
reading. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

So now we have 2 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer's comirnaty and Moderna's spikevax) that are (a)
stupendously effective, (b) massively safe, (c) have been dosed in _billions_ of people,
(d) are fully FDA approved, and (e) fully CDC recommended for practitioners.  

If you haven't yet been vaccinated: this is your signal that _everything_ has been done to
prove that these are some of the safest and most effective medicines in human history.
Don't you think it's time you get yourself some of that?
