I can't say I entirely approve of this.  But I _do_ understand the desire to inconvenience the Russian government given the Ukraine invasion, and the humor involved in the chosen method.

From _BoingBoing_ comes some bizarre news <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, even by the already amiably bizarre standards of _BoingBoing_.  

Some wags use the amusing cognomen of ["Obfuscated Dreams of Scheherezade" (@ringringrussia on Twitter)](https://twitter.com/ringringrussia), by which they apparently mean to spin amusing stories without being caught.  Fair enough.  

They have (somehow!) a database of thousands of phone numbers of Russian employees of the Duma, mid-level administrators, high-level politicians, and the people at the Ministry of War and Economy (interesting that "war" and "economy" go together in the Russian government, no?).  So far, so good.  

But these latter-day followers of [_Till Eulenspiegel_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Till_Eulenspiegel) provide a web site with single-click ability to call 2 of those numbers simultaneously, and then drop out of the call.  From the point of view of the 2 hapless Russian bureaucrats, they have apparently called each other.  They will then, in Frauenfelder's words, "waste precious government time asking each other what the hell is going on".  

It's pure _schadenfreude_ (though without [the requisite pie, _apologiae ad familiam Scalzi_](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2006/09/26/how-to-make-a-schadenfreude-pie/)).  I'm also sure it's illegal, if only for the reason that somebody is always trying to make everything illegal.  

But it _is_ hilarious.  

I won't link to it directly, though I do smile in their general direction.
