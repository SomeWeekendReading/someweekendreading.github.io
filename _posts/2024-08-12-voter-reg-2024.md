Republican voter suppression and other electoral mischief is already starting.  It's time
now to check your registration, and keep checking it until November.  


## Republican Rules of Elections: Calvinball!  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Calvinball.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/Calvinball-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="498" alt="Watterson's Calvinball: an incoherent gemische of rules, changed to give momentary advantage" title="Watterson's Calvinball: an incoherent gemische of rules, changed to give momentary advantage" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
It seems like Republicans think elections are run not just by moving the goalposts, but by
the rules of [Calvinball](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Calvinball).  

For those who are not _cognoscenti_ of American comics, there used to be a strip by Bill
Watterson, called Calvin and Hobbes.  It chronicled the exploits of a young boy named
Calvin, and his imaginary friend Hobbes (who was actually a stuffed tiger when anyone else
was present).  They would periodically play a game they called "Calvinball", of with the
strip shown here is representative.  

The rules were a _gemisch_ of every possible game, involving flags, balls, decks of
cards, songs, and anything else you can imagine along with a good deal that you cannot
imagine.  The rules changed wildly from moment to moment, to benefit one player or
another.  

And so it is here: Republicans keep re-imagining the rules in ways that are wildly at
variance both with their clear legal meaning and even common sense.  Somehow, each
variation is to advantage Republicans: voter de-registration and voter suppression to
prevent voting, threats not to certify a Harris win so the system literally cannot
function, actual death threats to the nice retired little old ladies who are election
workers, and so on.  


## Mass De-Registration of Voters  

What got my goat today is the mass de-registration of voters, without notice, in the red states.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-12-voter-reg-2024-cd-1.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="BeMiller @ Columbus Dispatch: 155,000 Ohio voters de-registered" title="BeMiller @ Columbus Dispatch: 155,000 Ohio voters de-registered" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
For example, Ohio has deregistered about 155,000 voters. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
Initially officials published a list of 158,857 voters as "eligible for cancellation",
based on some criterion or other that didn't seem to matter until now, on the eve of
election season.  Then 3862 people woke up and protested, demanding to be kept on the
registry.  So in the end, 154,995 voters were removed.  

Still, it's a numbers game: that means almost 97.5% of those "eligible for cancellation"
were in fact eventually de-registered.  In theory, if they realize it in time, they can
re-register before the election, but there are deadlines coming on apace.  

(We should also note that Ohio officials claim, but offer no evidence, that they found 499
non-citizens registered.  This is a _very_ tiny fraction even of the allegedly problematic
registrations: 499 / 154,995 = 0.32%.)  

Ohio officials have also pulled out of the Election Registration Information Center (ERIC), the
multi-state program that lets states share information.  This makes it easier for Ohio
Republicans to wreak local havoc, not being more broadly detectable by linkages to
scrutiny in other states.  

It's just really, really ugly.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-12-voter-reg-2024-dmn-1.jpg" width="400" height="144" alt="Bahari @ Dallas Morning News: Texas suspends 2.1 million voters" title="Bahari @ Dallas Morning News: Texas suspends 2.1 million voters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
"Everything is bigger in Texas", as the saying goes.  So too is what looks like dirty tricks around
their elections: they have suspended 2.1 million voters out of a total of 18 million, or about
12% of their entire voting population! <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

It appears that "suspended" in Texas means they need to confirm your address, though it's
suspicious that this need for confirmation comes up so suddenly right before an election.
It still puts an additional hurdle between voters and voting.  

It's _extremely_ hard to believe that they _just now noticed_ that 12% of their voters
have suspicious addresses!  


## How Your Humble Weekend Editor Checked Registration  

Here in Massachusetts, I'm not particularly worried about Republican skulduggery, since
there are so few of them and they are so easily identifiable.  However, stuff happens.
I've had occasion to correspond with my Town Clerk, and found her to be quite competent,
happy to answer questions, and a generally pleasant person.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-12-voter-reg-2024-ballot.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-12-voter-reg-2024-ballot-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="162" alt="Fall Democratic primary ballot mailed in and accepted pending counting" title="Fall Democratic primary ballot mailed in and accepted pending counting" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
In spite of that, I checked my registration in the most direct way: by actually mail-in
voting in a Democratic primary to be held on 2024-Sep-03.  (A largely pointless Democratic
primary, it must be said.  All the races were unopposed the Democratic party, with the
exception of the delegate to the Governor's Council.  Like everybody else, I have no idea
what that is.)  

As you can see here, my ballot was mailed to me on 2024-Jul-25 and received back safe in
the arms of the Town Clerk on 2024-Jul-30.  The "Accepted" status means it's been
received, passes all the checks, and is ready to be counted on the appointed day.  

That's good, but I'll keep checking my registration periodically to make sure no mishaps
occur between now and the election.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-12-voter-reg-2024-vote-dot-org.jpg" width="400" height="245" alt="Vote.org: how to find your state's registry of voters and check your registration" title="Vote.org: how to find your state's registry of voters and check your registration" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
If you're an eligible US voter, you should check yours, too.  

But beware of scam sites: there are apparently a lot that if you say you're a Trump voter,
they send you to the real registration site, but if not they just collect all your data
and then do _not_ help you register!  (No, I will _not_ supply a link to an example.)  

The right way to do this is via the nonprofit, nonpartisan vote.org web site.  If you
visit their ['Am I registered to vote?'](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/)
page, a simple form will figure out what to do, starting with your name and address.
Typically, it will forward you to a page run by the secretary of state for your state,
where you can fully, formally, and legally register.  


## Further Mischief  

As [we opined after the last election]({{ site.baseurl }}/unsatisfactory-election/), the
baroque US election system has many pain points where it can be brought to a halt.  The
founders never anticipated anyone like Trump and the way he has corrupted an entire
party.  Their willingness to burn down the system was just&hellip; epochal:  
- they sued in every relevant state (and lost every time),  
- they obstructed the certification process (trying, e.g., to remove Detroit and only
  count the rest of Michigan),  
- they created slates of false electors to subvert the Electoral College (many of those
  fake electors now criminally indicted),  
- they engaged in violent insurrection to prevent Congress from tabulating the Electoral
  College votes (many insurrectionists, though not enough, now incarcerated).

Aaaaaaaand&hellip; they're gearing up now to do it again, this time with more competent
lawyers and more deeply embedded election deniers.  

This video, which I highly recommend, is from a series called "Talking Feds" run by
[Harry Litman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Litman),
a former US Attorney and Deputy Assistant Attorney General, now a law professor and
political commentator. I've enjoyed his explanations of exactly what's going on (or not!)
with Trump's federal criminal trials.  Here he's interviewing
[Marc Elias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Elias), a lawyer who
litigates around voting rights, gerrymandering, and election fairness issues.  He runs a
series called "Democracy Docket", which is also worth your attention.  

They outline some of the ways Republicans are planting legal land mines to prevent a fair
election.  This includes strategies right down the the county level, where a Republican
election commissioner just digs in and refuses to certify the count.  That encumbers the
state election certification, which then cripples the Electoral College.  That would throw
the election into the House, where basically each state gets 1 vote, ensuring a Trump
win.  

That is, they have _plans in place to ignore the election and install Trump no matter
what._  

Sure, people like Litman and Elias (and the Democratic leadership generally) are
preparing.  At the individual level, we can help most by (a) ensuring nobody tampers with
our voter registration, (b) voting Democratic up and down the ticket, and (c) getting
acquainted with our local election officials.  

Only if it's an absolute landslide will they back off trying to subvert it all for Trump.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-12-voter-reg-2024-the-boys-keep-watch.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-12-voter-reg-2024-the-boys-keep-watch-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="The Boys are keeping watch until November" title="The Boys are keeping watch until November" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
As you can see from this photo of the Weekend Publisher and the Assistant Weekend
Publisher, the boys are on the lookout for any nefarious dealings in our vicinity.  Your
humble Weekend Editor will do the same, checking registration every 2 weeks or so between
now and November.  

You should do the same, especially if you live in a red state or even in a county where
the people running the election are Republicans.  When it comes to defending democracy,
try to be at least as vigilant as my cats, ok?  

And then _use_ that registration: vote!  
- Please do not under any circumstances vote for any Republican, not for any conceivable
  office, not under any imaginable circumstance.  
- Do not fail to vote.  Do not vote 3rd party. Those don't send a message beyond "I don't
  care".  They are half a vote for Trump.  
- You must vote Democratic, up and down the ticket, starting with Harris/Walz at the top.  

Then we can get back to the serious business of dealing with Trump in the proper fashion
which he has worked so hard to earn:  [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)  

## Addendum 2024-Aug-12: _The Bulwark_ on Republicans Refusing to Certify Elections  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-12-voter-reg-2024-bulwark-1.jpg" width="400" height="186" alt="Stoddard @ Bulwark: Republican strategies to refuse to certify the election" title="Stoddard @ Bulwark: Republican strategies to refuse to certify the election" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Someone just pointed me to an article at _The Bulwark_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, a
nominally conservative site which gives some more details on the Republican strategy to
refuse to certify the election.  

> An [investigation by __Rolling Stone__](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-swing-state-officials-election-deniers-1235069692/) identified “in the swing states of Arizona, Georgia,
> Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania . . . at least 70 pro-Trump election
> conspiracists currently working as county election officials who have questioned the
> validity of elections or delayed or refused to certify results.” Of those 70, 22 of them
> already have “refused or delayed certification” in recent past elections. Nationwide,
> Republicans have refused to certify results at least 25 times since 2020, in eight
> states—the most in Georgia.  

Again, it's hard for me to accept that our media is in such a state of collapse that
_Rolling Stone_ is a source of good political reporting&hellip; but here we are.  (Other
sources are, of course, used in the _RS_ article: _Justia_, US government archives, the
Brennan Center for Justice, the _Wasington Post,_ CBS, and so on.)  

Republicans are aleady identifying voters in each county who could serve as plaintiffs for
the tsunami of election anti-certification lawsuits.  Apparently even President Biden, speaking
to CBS, is "not confident at all" that the transfer of power will be peaceful if Trump loses.  

Yes, it's ugly out there now.  But Republicans are about to make it _worse._  

So get off the couch and check your voter registration, ok?
