[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about whether the COVID-19
vaccine could cause infertility.  Wait, what?  


## It's not always the wrong question  

The people who asked me are in a family where the grandparent generation were prescribed 
[diethyl stilbestrol (DES)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethylstilbestrol) to prevent
miscarriage.  While well-intended, that synthetic estrogen drug had effects on female
babies that made them more prone to a number of disorders, including some cancers.  So
it's not _impossible_ that some medical treatments can reach across generations.  

However:  
- the COVID-19 vaccines are _not_ hormones directly affecting the reproductive
  system, like DES.  
- Also, DES was taken off the market _50 years ago:_ we've learned a lot from it (and how
  not to do it again).  
- Also also, episodes like that are so rare they are famous: DES and thalidomide
  come to mind as cautionary tales that _everybody knows and takes precautions to prevent
  their re-creation._  

So let's look into the COVID-19 and infertility thing, but keep in mind we're likely to
find that it's just a paranoid myth, not another DES in the making.  _That's_ the evidence
that might set minds at ease.


## Some Paranoid Myths Around COVID-19 Vaccines  

People say the damndest things.

In spite of all the effort to educate the public, there are a dozen or so superspreaders
of misinformation poisoning the well, telling people that the vaccines _somehow:_  
- Change your DNA, inserting lizard space alien sequences  
- Make you magentic  
- Make you receive 5G signals so the government can reprogram you  
- Make you autistic  
- Make you more submissive to authority  
- Give you COVID-19  
- Insert [a tracking chip](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/variants-vs-vaccines/#what-about-vaccine-resistance) (unlike your cell phone, which _already_ tracks you)  
- Are the [Number of the Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_beast)  
- &hellip; and too many more to catalog without becoming ill.  

They mention every conceivable notion &ndash; and a good many inconceivable ones &ndash;
_except the one that matters:_ the vaccines will make you unlikely to be hospitalized with
COVID-19 or die with COVID-19!  

Today's knuckleheadery, though, is the myth that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines could make you
sterile, allegedly due to some dingbattery about population control variously
attributed to George Soros and Bill Gates.  

Leaving aside the George Soros and Bill Gates stuff which always seems to crop up, let's
just think for a moment:  
- The vaccines have been given to more than 2 billion people; wouldn't we have noticed
  infertility by now?  
- There were clinical trials _specifically on pregnant women_; wouldn't we have noticed
  miscarriages by now?  
- The [CDC _specifically advises_ that pregnant people should get the vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html):  

> __If I am pregnant, can I get a COVID-19 vaccine?__  
>  
> __Yes__, COVID-19 vaccination is recommended for all people 12 years and older, including
> people who are pregnant, breastfeeding, trying to get pregnant now, or might become
> pregnant in the future. You might want to have a conversation with your healthcare
> provider about COVID-19 vaccination. While such a conversation might be helpful, it is
> not required before vaccination. Learn more about vaccination considerations for people
> who are pregnant or breastfeeding.
>
>If you are pregnant and have received a COVID-19 vaccine, we encourage you to enroll in
>v-safe, CDCâ€™s smartphone-based tool that provides personalized health check-ins after
>vaccination. A v-safe pregnancy registry has been established to gather information on
>the health of pregnant people who have received a COVID-19 vaccine.


## The Bad Seed  

Let's dig in a bit deeper, and try to figure out whence this particular paranoid fantasy
came.  These things usually grow from a bad seed somewhere.  

<iframe width="400" height="244" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xlwABLyOwPs" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
First we'll look through this nice bit of public science communication 
<sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> from "ZDoggMD", the pseudonym of 
[Zubin Damania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zubin_Damania), a
Stanford-trained hospitalist, now a clinical assistant professor of medicine at UNLV.  The
high points:  

- Spike protein is alleged to cause miscarriages because of sequence similarity to
  [syncytin-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncytin-1) in the placenta.  In other words,
  they think the spike protein will give you a never-before-seen autoimmune disease where
  antibodies attack the placenta.
  __Factually false:__ using
  [BLASTP](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PROGRAM=blastp&PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch&LINK_LOC=blasthome),
  you can check for yourself.  But I won't bother:  
  - the "similarity" is only 4 amino acids long, while [UniProtKB](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9UQF0) tells me syncytin-1 is 538 AA long,  
  - it's in a non-functional position,  
  - the antibodies don't bind there.  
- __Logical fallacies:__ Natural COVID would also sterilize, if this syncytin-1 theory were true.
  Antibodies from natural immunity and from vaccination are pretty alike.  Natural COVID
  doesn't cause sterility.
- Somehow vaccinated people shed spike protein, to sterilize women around them. ZDoggMD
  described this as "a new low". 
  __Moving the goalposts__ is a  common feature of conspiracy theories.  If you debunk one
  claim, they just retreat to another. If vaccine doesn't do it to you, you'll somehow do
  it to others through "protein shedding" which has _never been observed before._  
- The "expert" being cited is [Sherri Tenpenny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherri_Tenpenny).
  She's a former osteopath, with no training in immunology.  She's now a professional
  anti-vaxxer, and even makes money with a course to train other anti-vaxxers.
  __Fake experts__ is another sign of conspiracy theories.  
- There's no known mechanism for protein shedding.  It has never been seen in any other
  vaccine, nor in protein-based drugs.  It's only present in a small area of your arm
  muscle, not the whole body.  It's only there 24-48 hours and has no way to get out of
  your body and into someone else's.  There's no mechanism to cause sterility.  __Magical thinking__
  like this is another symptom of craziness.  
- __Conspiracy thinking:__ Point to some dark forces that secretly want to harm you:
  sterilize because of something-something Bill Gates, or Big Pharma doesn't want you to know 
  so they can sell you a cure.  (Though that's ironic, because Tenpenny is _literally_ selling
  the conspiracy.)  
- __Cherry-picking data:__ You can always find 1 paper in the literature saying just about
  anything, e.g., here about syncytin-1.  But the consensus of all the rest of the
  literature is "no".  It's all just
  [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias).  

They almost make it too easy, by ticking off all the checkboxes of conspiracy thinking (in
bold above): factually false statements, logical fallacies, moving the goalposts, fake
experts, magical thinking, conspiracy tropes, and cherry-picking data.  Le sigh.  


## What else ya got?  

Ok, that's pretty damning.  And Damania is quite highly experienced and eloquent, but he's
just one guy.  Can we find evidence in the scientific (and other) literature that agrees with him?  

Why, yes.  Yes, we can.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-17-covid-vaccines-infertility-reuters.jpg" width="400" height="251" alt="Reuters Fact Check: vaccines do not target syncytin-1" title="Reuters Fact Check: vaccines do not target syncytin-1" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
A "Fact Check" article on _Reuters_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> confirms that the
root of this conspiracy theory is the alleged link between SARS-CoV2 spike protein and
syncytin-1, which in fact does not exist.  It describes the two proteins as "not very
similar", matching in only 4 amino acids out of the 538 in syncytin-1.  (I wonder what's
the probability of getting a 4AA match between any 2 random proteins?)  Verdict: FALSE.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-17-covid-vaccines-infertility-biolreprod.jpg" width="400" height="120" alt="Functional characterization of syncytin-1" title="Functional characterization of syncytin-1" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
A 2004 review will tell you all you want to know about syncytin-1 and its functional
characteristics.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  Oddly, syncytin-1 is a human
endogenous retrovirus protein itself!  Sometime in the distant past, a primate caught an
endovirus which wrote some of its DNA into said primate.  Our bodies have subsequently
learned to use it.  Biology is _weird._

A more popular-literature article from LifeHacker <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> gives
us the very good news that vaccination is safe, _even while pregnant._  As usual, they
give nice references to the actual scientific literature.  

They first point to a CDC media release officially declaring the COVID-19 vaccines safe for
pregnant people. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> It's much riskier _not_ to vaccinate.
The CDC has, accordingly, updated their official advice recommending COVID-19 vaccination
during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  

A preprint from another study <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> compared miscarriage rates between
vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, and found no difference.

Another study published in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>
followed over 35,000 people.  They found rates of pregnancy loss, premature birth, and small
birth weight were no different from pre-COVID studies, i.e., the vaccines don't hurt
anything.

A very clever study published in the
_American Journal of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology_ <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup> worked
the problem in the other direction: let's assume the vaccine is safe for pregnant people,
so check if it _still works as a vaccine_, i.e., that pregnancy doesn't mess up the
vaccine efficacy.  The answer is cheering: yes, it's effective, and as a bonus the babies
retained some antibodies for SARS-CoV2 after birth.  (This has been seen for other
vaccines.   Many doctors recommend a pertussis shot (TDaP) during pregnancy.)  

So the verdict is very, very clear: vaccines not only do not cause infertility, they are 
_warmly recommended_ by the CDC, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists,
and the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Society.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-08-17-covid-vaccines-infertility-health-in-pictures-cartoon.jpg" width="400" height="475" alt="Health in Pictures: Satirical Vaccine Cartoon from 1930s" title="Health in Pictures: Satirical Vaccine Cartoon from 1930s" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Get vaccinated.  Don't be like these guys, from a political cartoon in the 1930s.
([Snopes says it's real.](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/1930s-cartoon-vaccine-warning/))  

It's a satire from a 1930s pamphlet called "Health in Pictures", though the name of the
artist has been lost.  It was in the context of efforts to eradicate smallpox, earlier in
the 20th century.  They have climbed a cliff of misinformation, and are about to plunge to
their deaths in a sea of smallpox.  

Yeah&hellip; don't be these guys.  I'd like to keep my fantasy that in the intervening
century we may have learned something.  Please don't disabuse me of that.  

Ok?  


## Addendum 2021-Sep-08: Ivermectin and infertility  

Late addendum, I know.  But this is just too good to pass up.

Ivermectin is an antihelminthic medication ("de-wormer") used mostly on horses, cattle and
sheep.  There is a human version for intestinal worms, and a topical version for smearing
on the scalp if you have head lice.  Fair enough, so far.  

For essentially superstitious reasons, the right-wing conspiracy nuts think it's a
"secret" cure for COVID-19 that Big Bad Pharma doesn't want you to know about.  As a
result they've been filling up poison control units by eating doses fit for horses.
They're afraid of real prevention by vaccines because they think they'll become infertile,
but&hellip; it turns out there's an old study that shows ivermectin caused infertility due
to poor sperm quality in 85% of the men who took it (__NB:__ the original tweet seems to
have been deleted as of 2021-09-08 9:00pm;
[Snopes](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ivermectin-sterility-in-men/) says it isn't
