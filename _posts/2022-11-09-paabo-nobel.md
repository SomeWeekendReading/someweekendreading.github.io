The 2022 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to Svante P&auml;&auml;bo.  


## For what?  

(Yes, I am avoiding thinking about the US midterm election results until they're more
final.)

Today I learned, in the newsletter from the International Society for Computational
Biology and then from the Nobel Assembly itself, that Svante P&auml;&auml;bo was awarded
the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> He's shown
here with an old friend.  (Yes, it was more than a month ago.  I don't follow the awards
closely.)  

For what?  You mean, beyond the name?  I mean, the guy's got not just one, not just two,
but _two consecutive umlauts in his name!_  

But his other accomplishments, beyond orthography, are impressive too: he led the team
that sequence the Neanderthal genome!  Additionally, he discovered a previously unknown
hominin clade, the Denisovans.  Either would have been a career capstone; both are just
stupendous.  

The results are amazing all by themselves.  Even more interestingly is the amount of gene
transfer: we have both Neanderthal and Denisovan genes in modern humans.  

I've heard P&auml;&auml;bo speak.  He's famous for having _no bullet points_ on his
slides, and almost no words.  He just shows pictures and equations, and talks about them.
It's a really, _really_ effective technique.  

## The Weekend Conclusion  

A prize well earned!
