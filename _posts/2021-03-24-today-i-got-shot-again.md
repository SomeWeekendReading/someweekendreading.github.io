Today I got shot (again).  In the good sense: the second dose of Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19
vaccine.  


## The vaccine experience  

[Last time]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot/) was a
[Kafkaesque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka) nightmare, both for 
[getting the first dose appointment at all]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot/#getting-an-appointment) 
and then 
[scheduling the second dose]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot/#booking-the-2nd-appointment-for-the-booster).
This time, the appointment having been booked already, I just had to show up and do as I'm told.
("Showing up", I can manage.  "Doing as I'm told" has always been a lifelong struggle.
But if I have to struggle a bit to take on board another dose of 
BNT162b2/PF-07302048 <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, then "struggle" is the order of the day.)

Herein illustrated (again) is your humble Weekend Editor's portside dorsal manipulator
tentacle, again being injected with a lovely dose of BNT162/PF-07302048,
a.k.a. tozinameran/Comirnaty.  

Again, the actual vaccination process &ndash; separate from the sign-up nightmare &ndash;
went quite smoothly.  The Weekend Editrix dropped me at a train station, and I took a
couple of subway rides.  I was early, so I sat in the station happily reading 
[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) on my phone.  

At the appointed time, I took the short health quiz on my phone, went into the large
building, presented my id/appointment/health quiz/vax card and was waved into line.  A few seconds
later, the injection happened.  This time it was an older guy, a sort of gruff no-nonsense
fellow like a drill sergeant.  Friendly enough, though.  And he got the job done.  

The most oddball thing was that somebody next to me fainted, apparently due to a fear of
needles.  Still, that person seemed to get very attentive care from the EMTs who were
standing by, so that was actually kind of good to see.  

Then a boring 15 minutes in the waiting area, to demonstrate that I was not in
anaphylactic shock, and I was done.  The best part: I didn't have to go back to the
absolutely miserable sign-up web site to book any more appointments!  A couple subway
rides later, and I was back in the custody of the Weekend Editrix.  

Maybe in the fall we'll all have to get a booster tuned to the VoCs (variants of
concern).  But until then, it's just waiting for antibody levels to build, and for memory
B-cells to form a grudge against the coronavirus spike protein.  

And _most importantly:_ back to the miserable sign-up web site, to find a slot for the
Weekend Editrix.  In spite of her youth, she has now just become eligible, so&hellip; "once
more into the breach", as I read in an old book somewhere or other.  So tomorrow when the
new appointments drop, I'll be back to madly refreshing 10 browser tabs all morning long,
fishing for an appointment for her.  


## The aftermath  

Tune in tomorrow, to see if there are more exciting sleepwalking adventures&hellip; which
I would gladly trade for a bit of aches &amp; fever instead.  


## Addendum 2021-Mar-25  

My reaction so far has been pretty reasonable: pain at the injection site (upper left arm,
and stronger than with the first dose), fatigue, mild sense of less control over body
temperature, and so on.  Not being able to use my left arm much is slightly annoying, but
other than that, nothing worse than "slightly annoying".  Gratifyingly, no return of the
sleepwalking from the first time.  


### Can we pre-dose with NSAIDs to prevent the after-vaccination blahs?  

This post attracted one of the rare comments this blog occasionally gets (aside
from the daily viagra and college essay 'vendors').  Pablo, one of about 6 people
world-wide who read this crummy little blog, wondered whether pre-dosing with NSAIDs to
blunt the after-vaccination blahs would be ok.  

The answer appears to be: no, please don't do that.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-24-today-i-got-shot-again-ucdavis.jpg" width="400" height="146" alt="UC Davis: don't use OTC pain relievers before COVID-19 vaccination" title="UC Davis: don't use OTC pain relievers before COVID-19 vaccination" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Some public-facing advice from UC Davis Health Center <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
says that it's a bad idea to use NSAIDs before vaccination, but it's ok to do so as needed
_after_ any reaction sets in the next day:  
> Don't medicate with over-the-counter pain relievers before coming in for your shot. We
> don't know yet what impact that might have on your vaccine-induced antibody response.  
> &hellip;  
> After your vaccination, it's OK to take over-the-counter pain relievers if you need them
> for a headache, mild fever or any other discomforts.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-24-today-i-got-shot-again-chen-2.jpg" width="500" height="662" alt="Chen, et al.: NSAIDs impair induction of proinflammatory cytokines" title="Chen, et al.: NSAIDs impair induction of proinflammatory cytokines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
A more formal scientific publication in _Journal of Virology_ by Chen, 
_et al._ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> supports this quantitatively, especially in
Figures 6 &amp; 7:  
> NSAID treatment impairs systemic neutralizing antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2.  
> &hellip;
> NSAID treatment dampens the induction of proinflammatory cytokines that are upregulated
> by SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice.  

They tested both ibuprofen and meloxicam (another NSAID used in arthritis pain), looking
at the response in mouse lung tissues.  It appears that the NSAIDs primarily reduced the
response of the innate immune system (the early, non-specific immune system that tries to
recognize infection generally, not any specific infection).  This was observed both in the
production of IgG and IgM antibodies, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines, verified
statistically by Mann-Whitney ordinal tests and quantitative $t$-tests.  The adaptive
immune response (later, very specific antibodies, was apparently not observed as closely).

This makes sense, as the post-vaccine blahs are mostly a product of innate immunity.  

However, it seems the adaptive immune response (the thing you want) is in part driven by
the innate immune response, as a sort of early warning system.  So you really don't want
to shut this down entirely (pre-dose with NSAIDs).  But once it's already on and the
signal to the adaptive immune system has been sent, NSAIDs would probably be ok.  

__Conclusion:__ Don't pre-dose with NSAIDs.  Take them the next day, as needed, for
side-effects.  

(And remember: your humble Weekend Editor is a doctor, but not a medical doctor, and in
particular not _your_ doctor.  This is intellectual fun, not medical advice.)  

### What about people who don't get much of a reaction?  

Another question, of the [somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe)
variety that keeps cropping up, is whether one should worry if one has no noticeable side
effects.  Did the vaccine fail to work?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-24-today-i-got-shot-again-mayo.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Mayo Clinic: nothing wrong with no reaction" title="Mayo Clinic: nothing wrong with no reaction" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-24-today-i-got-shot-again-npr.jpg" width="400" height="262" alt="NPR: having no reaction is just lucky" title="NPR: having no reaction is just lucky" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-24-today-i-got-shot-again-cleveland-clinic.jpg" width="400" height="88" alt="Cleveland Clinic: no side-effects doesn't mean immune system isn't working" title="Cleveland Clinic: no side-effects doesn't mean immune system isn't working" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
The consensus appears to be: don't worry about it, the vaccine is almost certainly working
and your immune system is probably in the "Goldilocks just right" category of response.  

For example, UCDavis Health (_op. cit._) answers thusly:  
>Yes, it's still working. Everyone reacts a little differently to every vaccine. For some
>people, their reaction is no reaction. But your immune response is still building and the
>COVID-19 vaccine is still working.  

Several physicians at the Mayo Clinic <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> had pretty much the
same reaction to this question:  
> If people have less of a reaction, it does not mean they aren't developing an immune
> response, Dr. [Greg] Poland emphasizes.  
> &hellip;  
> "Each of our bodies releases different amounts of chemicals or immune signals,"
> Dr. Poland explains further. "One body might release more than what's needed, causing
> the physical reactions, and another body might release exactly the right amount of
> immune signals. It's what we've called the 'Goldilocks phenomenon.' Not too much, not
> too little, but just right."  

NPR also interviewed a number of experts from Harvard Med School and the Tufts
University's Department of Infectious Disease and Global Health <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> 
with the same result:  
>&hellip; it's possible to receive a (perfectly administered) vaccine and suffer no symptoms
>whatsoever. Just "consider yourself lucky," says Harvard Medical School physician Abraar
>Karan.  
> &hellip;  
> "The fact that [an individual] did not see a reaction is not a reason to believe that

> Jonathan Runstadler, a professor at Tufts University's Department of Infectious Disease
> and Global Health. Especially, he adds, as our bodies' tendency to react to a vaccine
> "varies a lot between individuals and the individual's circumstances, like where the
> needle went into the [patient's] arm or where in the arm the shot was deposited."

Finally, an interview with physicians from the Cleveland Clinic <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
also got the same answer, with an explanation of innate vs adaptive immunity:  
> The immune system has two distinct responses after you get the vaccine, and side effects
> are only associated with the first, said Dr. James Fernandez, and allergy and immunology
> expert at the Cleveland Clinic.  
>  
> That initial response, known as innate immunity, is the body's first line of defense
> against a virus, bacteria or other pathogens. It kicks in shortly after you get
> vaccinated and can manifest in symptoms like arm pain or flu-like symptoms, Fernandez
> said.  
>  
>Some people may have a very robust response, but most do not, he said.  
>  
> "If you don't have side effects, it doesn't mean your immune system isn't working,"
> Fernandez said. "It might just mean that it's working appropriately and isn't kind of
> overshooting."  
>  
> The second response is adaptive immunity, and that's more important, Fernandez
> said. Adaptive immunity is the body learning to protect itself against pathogens like
> the virus that causes COVID-19. The body learns to recognize the virus and produces
> antibodies that protect it against infection.  
>  
> Adaptive immunity develops over the course of the several weeks after you get each dose
> of vaccine. That's why experts say full protection comes two weeks after your final
> dose.  
>  
>"It's really what the immune system does weeks later that is important," Fernandez
>said. "I wouldn't focus on those early side effects related to the vaccine to judge
>whether you had an [effective] response or not."  

__So the bottom line appears to be:__ don't worry if you didn't get a strong reaction; your
immune system probably has 'Goldilocks-just-right' response and your adaptive immunity is
building over the coming weeks.  If you're _still_ worried about it (why?), then maybe you
can get an antibody test in a couple weeks (antibody, not PCR, not antigen).  That will
tell if your adaptive immune system has gotten the message.
