Today I experienced a sacred moment.  Do you want to know more (homage &agrave; John
Varley's ["Press Enter"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Enter))?  


## A _What_ Moment?  

Yes, I am religious.  (No, I won't be in your face about it.  Nor will I think less of you
for feeling otherwise.  You _also_ are sacred, just as you are.  It's really, _really_ ok
if you disagree with me here.)  

But&hellip; it's a thing about me you need to understand if you want to understand _me._
(Though it's perfectly reasonable and good if you _don't_ want to understand me.  You're
_still_ sacred.)  (Hey&hellip; sincere question: is it weird when I have more things to
say parenthetically than ex-parenthtically?  I'm ok with weird, I just wanna know.  It's
really how I experience thinking; I just ordinarily edit it out.)  

This morning, as I was ensconced in my study engaged in the now-customary universal
doom-scrolling, I happened to glance out the window.  Yes, it's always dangerous to engage
with the world.  No, none of us ever learn not to do that.  It's a thing:  

> "&hellip; there is a law written in the darkest of the Books of Life, and it is this: If
> you look at a thing nine hundred and ninety-nine times, you are perfectly safe; if you
> look at it the thousandth time, you are [Pg 24] in frightful danger of seeing it for the
> first time." &ndash; [G. K. Chesterton, __The Napoleon of Notting Hill__, p. 23-24](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/quotes/#:~:text=%E2%80%9C%E2%80%A6there%20is%20a,p.%2023%2D24.).  

I saw a harmless, beautiful thing: a couple, neighbors whom I love, walked up the street with
their warm winter clothes and their very, _very_ happy dog.  (No, I didn't take a picture.
Yes, it would have made a better blog post&hellip; but it would have violated their privacy.)  

It brought actual tears to my eyes:  
- They were, in extraordinary times, engaged relentlessly in ordinary life.  
- Their "ordinary" life was anything _but_ morally ordinary: they were companionable,
  kind, and just&hellip; something one can expect as a part of being.  
  - My personal vision of a perfect world is one where it's reasonable to _expect_
  kindness as an ordinary condition of life.
- They were together.  They were happy.  (Especially the dog.  But the dog counts, too.)  

This is what matters to me about religion.  A numinous moment broke through into my quotidian
world.  

I witnessed a holy thing.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

It's important to _pay attention_ to the world.  Otherwise we might miss the sacred,
dangerous as it is (as Chesterton warned us, not at all parenthetically).  

And of course, as always: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)

Nope.
