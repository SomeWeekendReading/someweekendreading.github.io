Today the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meets to
review the Pfizer/BioNTech application for 3rd dose boosters of their COVID-19 vaccine.
Opinion is divided, so there will be some arguing.  I'm makin' popcorn.  


## What's the Sitch?  

So&hellip; boosters, huh?  

Last night [somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about my position
on boosters.  Briefly: the evidence is somewhat ambiguous (as 
[Simpson's Paradox]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-simpson/) showed in the Israeli data).  
1. It seems clear that the immunocompromised (immune disease sufferers, those taking
   immunosuppressants for transplants, etc.) should get a booster, since they probably
   never got much of an immune reaction in the first place.  
2. Second, it seems similarly clear that the elderly should also get a booster, since their
   immune systems take a bit longer to respond, and respond more weakly.  (The flu shot I
   just got had the "geezer dose": 4x the dose for the youngs.  Take _that_, kiddos!)
   Where to draw the age line for boosters is of course up for grabs; I'd be surprised if
   it were lower than 65 or higher than 75.  

Basically, a booster won't _hurt_, and will _help_ any given individual.  Whether that's the
best course or not for humanity as a whole is up for debate.  We are probably better off
using those doses to vaccinate the hesitant/resistant/defiant holdouts in the US, and
_everybody else in the world_ to stop the evolution of new variants.  

__That being said, if I'm offered a booster, I'll take it.__  My refusal would (a) be modeling
incorrect behavior for the vaccine hesitant/resistant/defiant, and (b) not guarantee my
dose would go to an unvaccinated person, but instead just that somebody else would get a
booster.  

So that's my prediction, if we're being sensible: boost the immunocompromised, the
elderly, and those at high risk (maybe like healthcare workers?); then concentrate the rest on
the vaccine hesitant/resistant/defiant and the rest of the world.  But as you know, the
right-wing half of the US population cannot be described as anything even vaguely adjacent
to "sensible".  (We used to tell people to "avoid something like the plague", but it turns
out Republicans don't do that.  Who knew?)  


## Today's FDA VRBPAC Meeting on Boosters  

Fortunately for all of us, my opinion is thoroughly irrelevant and about to become even
more so.  Today the FDA's Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee
(VRBPAC) meets to consider the Pfizer/BioNTech application for authorization of 3rd shot
boosters.  Whether rationally concluded or not, that will settle the matter for a while.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-17-fda-covid-boosters-fda-1.jpg" width="400" height="166" alt="FDA announces VRBPAC meeting on Pfizer/BioNTech booster application" title = "FDA announces VRBPAC meeting on Pfizer/BioNTech booster application" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The FDA announced this meeting at the beginning of this month <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, 
so things are moving _very_ fast by their standards.  (Anybody who tells you the FDA is
dragging their feet on COVID-19 vaccines doesn't know how this works!  Let alone _why_ it
works that way.)  Peter Marks, head of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research (CBER), said more or less the expected:  
- The Biden administration announced a plan for acquisition &amp; logistics of booster
  doses this fall, and
- FDA evaluation and approval is a prerequisite for that, and
- A data package submission is a prerequisite for _that_, and
- Pfizer/BioNTech have submitted such a package so they'll be moving it forward.  

Basically: "We're all doin' that thang we're s'pposta do!  Nothin' t'see here kid.  Move 'long."

It is of course being livestreamed direct from the FDA to various news media and
the FDA's own YouTube account (which I've embedded here).  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-17-fda-covid-boosters-fda-2.jpg" width="400" height="119" alt="FDA VRBPAC agenda on Pfizer/BioNTech booster application" title = "FDA VRBPAC agenda on Pfizer/BioNTech booster application" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The meeting agenda <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> looks pretty straightforward, too.  
- Random welcome/roll call/introduction stuff that is _de rigeur_ in these sorts of meetings,  
- FDA backgrounder, CDC summary of the epidemiology of Delta and breakthrough infections,
  some real-world data on vaccine efficacy across the world,  
- Sponsor presentation by Pfizer/BioNTech,  
- FDA presentation giving their independent evaluation of the same data,  
- Lunch (only 25min, so I hope somebody brings them sandwiches!), public hearings (usually
  pretty uninformed, ranty &amp; not worth the time, but legally required),  
- And then the important part: Q&A where the committee grills the submitter followed by
  discussion and voting.  
  
It all looks pretty reasonable, though given the high level of disagreement and tempers
involved, it could get a little heated.  I hope not.  


## The Data Packages  

We _could_ listen to the newsies and their horse-race commentary, who's up &amp; who's down,
how important this or that person is, what the polls will say about politics and Biden's 
policies&hellip; but I just don't have the stomach for that.  I mean, I'll watch a bit of
the expert testimony because those folks actually know what they're talking about.  But the
newsies almost _never_ know what they're talking about, and insist on talking anyway.
(__Notable exception:__ _STAT News_, especially reporters like Helen Branswell &amp;
Matthew Herper.  Below we will be well-guided by their liveblog of today's events.)

So instead we'll look at the documents themselves that were submitted to the FDA.
Nothing like seeing the _primary_ literature:  
- Pfizer/BioNTech submitted a 53 page packet <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, which is
  surprisingly short as these things go.  Interestingly, if you pick apart the PDF file
  the internal timestamps say it was last revised 2 days ago on 2021-Sep-15.  Given that
  Pfizer/BioNTech submitted on 2021-Aug-25 <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, this
  surprised me.  Must be a revised document, part of a "rolling submission".  
- As is customary in these matters, when you submit such a package to the FDA the first
  thing they do is throw away your conclusions and reanalyze the data themselves, using
  the methods specified in the proposal.  _Then_ they compare your answer to theirs, and
  look for any glaring inconsistencies.  Only when they broadly match do you go ahead to
  the committee meeting like today (otherwise you get a sternly worded letter telling you
  to withdraw your application immediately or they'll kill it forever and you won't be
  able to resubmit!).  So the FDA submitted their own 23pp package <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>
  which does exactly that.  
- It looks like there are [7 other presentations](https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/advisory-committee-calendar/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee-september-17-2021-meeting-announcement#event-materials) on:   
  - real-world effectiveness of the vaccines across the world,  
  - the formal licensure application by the FDA,  
  - the FDA's review of the safety and efficacy of boosters,  
  - Pfizer/BioNTech's review of the same thing,  
  - a review of the booster data from the Israeli experience,  
  - a summary of the epidemiology of the Delta variant and its impact on the need for
    boosters,  
  - the supplemental Biologics License Application (BLA), which is somehow different from 
    the formal licensure presentation.  

So&hellip; _lots_ of stuff!  Being on one of these committees is _work_.  


## A Quick Look Through the Pfizer Package &amp; Slides

I didn't scrutinze each of the 53 pages, but it seems they wanted to draw 2 major
conclusions:
1. A Kaiser Permanente of Southern California study showed vaccine efficacy waning (Figure
   1, p. 12, makes this point, but slide CC-13 of their 
   presentation <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> makes the point
   better and is reproduced here: the right plot shows sustained efficacy versus
   hospitalization). I'm glad they honestly say that efficacy against _hospitalization
   and death_ remained high (mostly > 90%).  So that's sort of wanting to have things both
   ways: yes, efficacy against any infection might decline (though they don't seem to be
   aware of Simpson's paradox!), but the efficacy we _care_ about is still robust.  Hmpf.  
2. A 3rd dose does indeed boost the geometric mean titer of antibodies, against both the
   wild-type and B.1.351 (Beta) variants (Figure 2, p. 19, makes this point, but slides
   CC-22 and CC-23 of their presentation make it more graphically, and include Delta).  The rise
   after the 3rd dose is statistically significant, as shown by the confidence intervals.
   The 3rd dose is the rightmost 2 pairs of bars in each group.  Note the vertical scale
   is a _log scale_, so these are really huge differences.  

So&hellip; yeah, it _works_.  But the evidence of _need_ is slightly sketchy.  

The FDA slide deck makes substantially the same points.  <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>
There's some slightly subtle foofraw about noninferiority criteria according to the 97.5%
lower confidence limit of the difference of&hellip; something or other about which you
probably don't care.  While the details here are unlikely to be of broad interest, the
game is to make sure the 3rd dose doesn't _harm_ immunity, and after that it _helps_.  

One thing that stood out to me in the FDA slides is that this was a _small_ study: $N =
23$ in Phase 1 and $N = 306$ in Phase 2/3.  So it's _definitely_ underpowered to detect
rare adverse events like the myocarditis/pericarditis in young males.  Still, one can
perhaps extrapolate from the rates seen in the first 2 shots, and hope the 3rd doesn't
change them for the worse.  


## Is Vaccine Efficacy Really Waning?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2021-08-29-covid-simpson-ve-confidence-intervals-by-age.png" width="400" height="400" alt="Israeli vaccine efficacies with confidence intervals, normalized and age-stratified" title = "Israeli vaccine efficacies with confidence intervals, normalized and age-stratified" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
This is a vexing question.  The initial Israeli data, 
[examined skeptically with Simpson's paradox in mind]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-simpson/),
indicates that efficacy is _not_ waning.  Even on this crummy little blog that nobody
reads, we can calculate vaccine efficacies and their confidence limits properly, to see
that at least in _that_ dataset, waning was not a happening thing.  

However, at today's VRBPAC data saying otherwise was presented by Alroy-Preis &amp; Milo
<sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>, who are between them affiliated with more or less all
the great Israeli research institutions.  Their credentials are as solid as their data is
sobering.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-17-fda-covid-boosters-israel-3.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="Israeli data: waning efficacy stratified by age/time of vaccination" title = "Israeli data: waning efficacy stratified by age/time of vaccination" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

After showing how _bad_ the previous waves were in Israel (hint: very, very bad), and how
fast they got vaccinated (hint: very, very fast), they looked at epidemiology and
breakthrough infections.  
- Slide 8 of their presentation shows that the only strain that matters is Delta, and it's
  just plain _nasty_.  
- Slide 9 shows they're in the midst of a nasty 3rd wave, worse than the others, of all
  Delta infections even with &gt; 60% of the population having received 2 doses.  
  - A couple thoughts from your humble Weekend Editor: Given
    that [Delta seems to have $R_0 \sim 6.7$]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccinations-vs-votes/), 
    that would imply herd immunity at about 85% of the population having immunity
    (vaccination or previous infection).  So 60% just won't do it.  
  - So if less than 25% of unvaccinated Israelis have had COVID-19, this is not out of
    line and may not reflect vaccine efficacy waning, unless it's concentrated among the
    vaccinated (as opposed to the unvaccinated, where we more or less expect it to be).  
- They've addressed some of my concerns about Simpson's paradox by stratifying by age
  (correlated with both time of vaccination and likelihood of hospitalization).  Slide 12
  shows confirmed infections per 1000 people, across 3 broad age groups.  The bars are
  colored by when they were vaccinated, showing higher infection rates for those
  vaccinated longer, after controlling for age.  
  - Still, your humble Weekend Editor wishes to point out that those vaccinated earlier
    were the oldest of the old and the frailest of the frail with complicating
    pre-existing conditions.  You'd _expect_ more breakthroughs there, right?  
  - So while these data are sobering, I'm not utterly convinced they've removed the
    confounding variables that lead to Simpson's paradox.  Maybe I'm just a skeptical
    grizzled old statistician.  (Well, that's literally true.  The question is whether that's
    relevant?)  
- Whatever reservations I may have, they do not share them.  Israel went about giving booster
  vaccinations with admirable enthusiasm.  They did it for their elders first, which makes
  sense, and the 60+ cohort is now mostly triple-vaccinated.  Slide 22 shows the result: a
  dramatic fold reduction in confirmed infection in that most triple-vaccinated cohort.  
- Similarly, a booster gave 10-fold reduction in risk of _severe_ disease, not just
  infection in the 60+ cohort.  That's good, because severe disease, hospitalization, and
  death are the things we care about most, not a mild breakthrough infection.  
- Best of all, the side effects looked comparable to, or even _less than_, what was seen
  in the first 2 doses.  They saw _only 1 case of myocarditis_.  (But that's a problem in
  younger males, and they vaccinated their elderly first, so the low number of events seen
  here may not mean much.)  

We can argue about the _need_ for boosters, but it's inarguably true that it _worked_.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-17-fda-covid-boosters-sterne-1.jpg" width="400" height="243" alt="Sterne: confounding variables correlated with both vaccination and an outcome" title = "Sterne: confounding variables correlated with both vaccination and an outcome" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

The counterpoint was presented by Jonathan Sterne, of the University of Bristol, on the
various confounders <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>, much like age was the confounder of
vaccination and hospitalization in
[the Simpson's paradox example]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-simpson/).  
- On slide 13, he points to 13 studies, examining in-the-wild vaccine efficacy in multiple
  countries where Delta is the dominant strain.  Even the 95% lower confidence limit on
  vaccine efficacy is still usually > 80% (with a few exceptions).  
- On slide 17, he has a beautifully clear graphic, reproduced here, explaining how
  confounders work, like age was a confounder of vaccination status and hospitalization in
  Israel, leading to the Simpson's paradox mislead of waning vaccine efficacy.  
- He then goes through slide after slide of variables that affect people's chances of
  being vaccinated, each of which are plausible or actually known to affect medical
  outcomes (age, BMI, ethnicity, COPD, dementia, &hellip;).  Since we haven't controlled
  for that, we're in Simpson's Paradox Town!  
- _Very_ interestingly on slide 39, he points out that the time of vaccination matters in
  relation to COVID-19 waves.  If you spend unvaccinated time during a lull, but get
  vaccinated right before a wave of infection breaks out, then there's a problem.  The
  relative risk you're exposed to has changed: less risk when you were unvaccinated, but
  more risk after vaccination in the wave of infection.  So that'll make vaccine efficacy
  look awful, when it's actually not.  (Hey, this guy's _good_ &ndash; I hadn't come
  anywhere _near_ thinking of that one!)  
- The title of slide 42 sums it up:  
> The vaccines work brilliantly.  
>  
> But how should we use observational data to guide policy?  

__Summary:__ The Israeli data was quite troubling, but the fact that boosters worked where
they were needed (mostly in the elderly) is incontestable.  Sterne's analysis, like our Simpson's
paradox analysis, does contest whether there's a universal _need_ for boosters.

Sara Oliver of the CDC presented an epidemiology update, particularly about Delta in the 
US. <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup>  Our times are very difficult, but the vaccines
continue to work:  
- On slide 6, she shows us the hospitalization rates in the US over time, stratified by age.  It
  shows the recurring wave structure, as we try again and again to be as stupid as
  possible.  Given the high rates for those in their 60s, this is no time to be
  unvaccinated.  It's dangerous out there.  
- On slide 8, she shows us that the Delta strain is the only SARS-CoV-2 strain that
  matters now.  It's just that _nasty_.  
- On slide 12, she shows us the vaccine penetrance in the US over time, stratified by
  age.  To my deep disappointment, it has reached a plateau in all age groups, at levels
  mostly below herd immunity (say, about 85% for Delta).  The only age cohorts that have
  reached that are the elderly (with almost-ran status for the late middle aged).  This
  should shame all of us in the US.  
- However, there is some good news about vaccines, which she shows us on slide 15.
  Vaccine efficacy _against hospitalization_ (not just against mild infection), has
  remained quite steady over time.  There's barely any change in the last 7 months.  The
  most pessimistic study is still north of 80% efficacy, with the rest around 90%.  That's
  good news indeed, and pretty strong empirical evidence _against_ vaccine efficacy waning
  where it matters: severe disease.  
- On slide 17, she examines apparent vaccine efficacy waning against infection (_not_ just
  severe infection, hospitalization, or death).  Looking at the timing, it seems much more
  likely that this is caused by the introduction of Delta, not by an waning of vaccine
  efficacy.  Not exactly good news (Delta = bad!), but at least 
  _the vaccines continue to work where it matters: preventing hospitalization &amp; death._  

__Summary:__ While infection, hospitalization, and death rates are high, it is mostly
among the unvaccinated.  Vaccines continue to provide robust protection against severe
disease.  Unfortunately, vaccination rates are slowing down, and the defiant few remaining
will require mandates to get vaccinated lest they get sick themselves, spread it to
others, or &ndash; Heaven forbid &ndash; evolve yet another variant.  


## The Question  

The VRBPAC will vote on the following question <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>:  

> Question to the Committee  
>   
> 1. Do the safety and effectiveness data from clinical trial C4591001 support approval of a COMIRNATY booster dose administered at least 6 months after completion of the primary series for use in individuals 16 years of age and older?  
>  
> Please vote Yes or No.  

__NB:__ That question implies no stratification by age, which 
[we already know makes huge differences]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-simpson/),
even on this crummy little blog that nobody reads.  Also, going down to age 16
[tripped them up a bit in the EUA hearings, getting 4 "No" votes](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/pfizer-vaccine-passes-vrbpac-review/#pediatric-patients),
and in any case
[the confidence interval on efficacy in 16-17 year olds was ridiculous](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/pfizer-vaccine-efficacy-confidence-intervals/#but-what-about-efficacies),
as also calculated on this crummy little blog that nobody reads.
Also also, the clinical trial for boosters apparently _did not include any subjects under 18_, so
asking for approval _for an age group you didn't test_ is skating on thin ice.  

You'd think Pfizer/BioNTech would have learned from their EUA experience not to propose
for low-statistics age cohorts&hellip; but here we are.  


## The Old Reliable(s)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-17-fda-covid-boosters-stat.jpg" width="400" height="441" alt="Branswell &amp; Herper: Live-blogging the FDA VRBPAC on COVID-19 boosters" title = "Branswell &amp; Herper: Live-blogging the FDA VRBPAC on COVID-19 boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The livestream video above has the goods in detail.  But for a more summary view, we turn
to the formidably reliable Helen Branswell and Matthew Herper at _STAT News_, who are
apparently live-blogging the affair. <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  

Some important introductory points they make are:  
- Everybody thinks spacing the doses out further than the initial 3-4 weeks would have
  resulted in better immunity, but at the cost of slowing down vaccinations.  So we chose
  faster vaccination in the face of a pandemic, but might want to reconsider that in the
  future.  
- Nobody quite knows what Delta (or it's much-feared hypothetical successor) will do;
  right now it seems to be moving from the upper airway to the lower airway, which is
  _not_ news.  
- We know a boost will _work_; the question is whether that's the best thing to do versus,
  say, vaccinating _everybody else_.  
- There are other vaccines that require 3 or more doses (Hep B, DTaP, Hib, PVC13, IPV&hellip; and
  that's just the examples I could find in 30sec!)  If the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 are
  in that class, "the world needs to know that."  
- __Important detail:__ The VRBPAC's job is to determine _only_ if treatments meet safety
  and efficacy needs.  It is _not_ about how ot roll out that treatment to the
  population.  So the practical logistics of boosters are off the table for today's
  discussion (or supposed to be).  Some of that will happen with the CDC's Advisory
  Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) which meets next Wednesday &amp; Thursday.  

A cute detail: Peter Marks, the head of CBER, uses a screen background of a polar bear
drinking tea.  I might like this guy&hellip;  

Another "elephant in the room", as Branswell put it, is the rare instances of myocarditis
and pericarditis that sometimes happen in young men, and whether a 3rd dose will raise
that frequency.  Nobody knows, because the clinical trial here was too small to be powered
to see such a rare event.  

However, Israel has boosted 1.2 million people and seen exactly 1 case of this sort of
heart inflammation.  So that's potentially a good omen if not exactly the RCT statistic
we'd like to have in the best of all possible worlds.  The acting chair of VRBPAC, Arnold
Monto, cautioned that Israel is doing the oldest first, so their data under-represents
males under 30 who are most at risk for myocarditis/pericarditis.  So&hellip; the risk
_looks_ low, but really nobody knows.  

Another slightly cute detail: Pfizer's presentation ran long, and when they attempted to
review the Israeli data that had already been discussed, the chair cut them off.  I admit
that as a now-retired pharma research scientist, it's a gleeful fantasy of mine to be able
to tell a senior VP of a pharma company to sit down and shut up.  (Perhaps I am a bad
person.  But it's hard to resist the cravings for a teensy slice of
[schadenfreude pie](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2006/09/26/how-to-make-a-schadenfreude-pie/).)  

The public comment period was as crazy a mixed bag as one might expect, including fairly
crazy skeptics who think _all_ COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe.  Le sigh.  Also present in
the public comment period: Paul Alexander, a former Trump administration official who is
skeptical of _all_ the COVID-19 vaccines.  He used to yell at FDA &amp; CDC officials,
[interfere with their reports where they did not meet Trump's fantasies](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/11/exclusive-trump-officials-interfered-with-cdc-reports-on-covid-19-412809),
and today generally ranted about the story of rapper Nicki Minaj's cousin's friend in
Trinidad with the swollen testicles&hellip; 
anything _except_ the subject of the meeting, which is booster safety and efficacy.
Alexander's Trumpian boss Michael Caputo apparently accused scientists of "sedition".  So
imagine the attention paid to their remarks.  

Interestingly, Jonathan Sterne of the University of Bristol presented some data from the UK
noting that there are many confounders with vaccine efficacy.  We explored some of that in
the Israeli data, showing that
[age caused a strong Simpson paradox effect]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-simpson/).  Sterne
showed a number of similar things happened in the UK, and might mislead one to think the
vaccines are fading when they are not.  Herper comments that this was done in such a
_sotto voce_ manner, that people might not have paid attention.  Honestly, do
we really have to scream _all the time?_  

At least in Herper's opinion, the morning failed to resolve definitively 2 important
questions that one would have hoped to have answered:  
- Is vaccine efficacy waning _against hospitalization and death_, not just any infection
  at all?  
- Are there safety issues with a 3rd dose, like myocarditis/pericarditis in young males,
  that would shift the risk vs benefit?  

### First Vote  

At 3:30pm, the vote on [the question above](#the-question) came out _negative_: 3 Yes, 16
No, 0 Abstain.  Interestingly, that's 19 votes out of the 18 committee members!  There was
one accidental vote, apparentlly by a speaker; their choice was unclear, but it could not
have changed the outcome.  (This will be a subject of gossip in the months to come: who
barged in and voted without the right?)  

Now they're discussing changing the question, to see if they can endorse boosters for some
subgroups of people, if not the entire population.  Remember 
[my prediction above](#whats-the-sitch), that this would be the sensible outcome?  Maybe,
just _maybe_&hellip;  

### Second Vote  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VRBPAC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VRBPAC</a> 
    votes unanimously to support recommending authorizing Pfizer boosters for people 65 and 
    older, and people at high risk because of exposures (HCWs) or comorbid conditions. 
    <a href="https://t.co/t3VtRt4BIz">pic.twitter.com/t3VtRt4BIz</a>
  </p>&mdash; Helen Branswell (@HelenBranswell) <a href="https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell/status/1438961816969916423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2021</a>

Right, so now they've rephrased the question, to be whether there should be boosters for
those over 65 and those at high risk of COVID-19 (presumably the immunocompromised and
healthcare workers).  It passed unanimously: 18 Yes, 0 No, 0 Abstain.  (And no "extra"
votes, this time.)  

This will be a recommendation for an Emergency Use Authorization for boosters in those
groups.  Your humble Weekend Editor will be eligible in next week if the interval is 6
months from the 2nd dose; the Weekend Editrix alas, is not eligible as she is under 65
(and thus strong in her own right, so that's not a bad thing).  

That seems eminently sensible to me!  After all, I predicted it this morning at the top
of this post, though I was too cynical to think it would actually happen.  _Mea maxima culpa._  

Next, the ACIP committe of the CDC meets for 2 days next week to figure out what to do
with this recommendation.  People who got Moderna or J&amp;J have yet to get a decision.


## The Weekend Conclusion

Hunh.  Lookitthat.  They went and did The Sensible Thing?!  

Apparently I am a cynical old grouch.  Like you didn't know that already.  

I look forward to my booster dose soon, since 6 months after my second dose will be
exactly 1 week from today!  


## Addendum 2021-Sep-21: ZDoggMD on the FDA VRBPAC Booster Hearing  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odKWcnp6Alk" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
For those who style themselves 'visual learners', here's a video by ZDoggMD (aka Dr. Zubin
Damania) talking about
the FDA booster hearing.  Keep in mind that he's an entertainer, so he has to be a little
ranty and over-the-top to get YouTube views.  However, he's a UCSF-trained doctor, spent
10 years as a hospitalist at Stanford, etc. &ndash; guy knows how the medical system works
(and doesn't work).  

It sounds like he and I are mostly aligned, in that the evidence of the need for boosters
is a little shaky: 
- the Israeli data is full of confounders like age (and Simpson paradox effects), 
- the Pfizer doses were only 3 weeks apart which may not have been enough (though it got
  people vaccinated faster, so there's _that_ trade-off), 
- the efficacy vs severe disease or hospitalization or death is still like 90%, 
- while boosters boost antibodies but those aren't the only measure of immune competence, 

&hellip; and so on.  So boosters make sense for those most at risk: elderly, health care
workers, and other high-risk situations (details to be worked out at the CDC's ACIP meeting).  

Where we differ is mandates.  

He skews more libertarian and wants to try more to persuade the vaccine defiant.  I think
we've done that for almost a year now; I've totally lost patience with them and favor
mandates.  My attitude is hey, if guys like Zubin here can make persuasion _work_ at a
scale to make a dent in the unvaccinated population, then great, they should do that.  But
the empirical result is that it hasn't worked: the vaccine defiant just shrug it off, spit
another conspiracy theory at you, and hork down some horse paste.  Time to try something
more effective.  

Perhaps Zubin is a nicer man than me.  I just want us all to be vaccinated, except for
rare medical exceptions where that's not possible.  


## Addendum 2021-Sep-22: FDA Approves Pfizer Boosters  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-17-fda-covid-boosters-stat-fda-approval.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="STAT: FDA Approves Pfizer/BioNTech Booster for Elders &amp; High Risks" title = "STAT: FDA Approves Pfizer/BioNTech Booster for Elders &amp; High Risks" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Helen Branswell at _STAT News_ is now reporting <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup> that
the FDA has today officially authorized Pfizer's COVID-19 booster for those over 65 or at
high risk.  They don't _have_ to follow the VRBPAC recommendation, but usually do; this
situation turns out to be part of the "usual".  

Per the CDC, there are about 53 million Americans over 65, and 17-20 million are health
care workers (no word on the overlap).  Possibly 100 million have complicating
conditions.  That adds up to about _half_ the US population, so there's going to be some
arguing about what exactly constitutes "high risk".  They're considering health care
workers, teachers, daycare staff, grocery workers, people in homeless shelters or
prisons&hellip; all kinds of people.  

The ACIP meets tomorrow and will vote on whether to advice the CDC to recommend boosters,
and for whom.  The CDC will _probably_ accept that recommendation, but again no
guarantees.  


## Addendum 2021-Sep-23: CDC ACIP Meeting Approves Most Boosters  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-17-fda-covid-boosters-stat-acip-approval.jpg" width="400" height="228" alt="Branswell at STAT: ACIP approves some boosters" title = "Branswell at STAT: ACIP approves some boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I didn't go over the materials in detail, since I'm taking a day off to do other things.  However,
[the meeting presentations are here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2021-09-22-23.html),
for your perusal.  

Also, the redoubtable Helen Branswell has a Twitter thread 
that more or less sums everything up for 
[yesterday's meeting](https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell/status/1440685043551137804) 
and [today's meeting](https://twitter.com/HelenBranswell/status/1441063256924303360).  
Her story is up at _STAT News_. <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup>  

Like the FDA VRBPAC, the CDC ACIP has re-engineered the question into 4 pieces.  Should we
give the Pfizer/BioNTech 3rd shot booster to:  
1. Age > 65yr or LTCF residents? __Passed: 15-0.__  
2. Age 50-64yr with underlying conditions?  __Passed: 13-2.__  
3. Age 18-49yr with underlying conditions?  __Passed: 9-6.__  
4. Age 18-64yr in occupational/institutional high risk setting?  __Failed: 6-9__  

You can see the unanimity degrades as the booster group expands.  


## Addendum 2021-Sep-24: Another Twist 'n' Turn  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-17-fda-covid-boosters-cdc-ruling.jpg" width="400" height="217" alt="CDC Guidance: Boosters all around, more or less?!" title = "CDC Guidance: Boosters all around, more or less?!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Today the CDC issued its official guidance. <sup id="fn15a">[[15]](#fn15)</sup>
Interestingly, it _overruled_ the ACIP committee and said categories 1 &amp; 2 _should_
get boosters, while categories 3 &amp; 4 _may_ get boosters.  In saying so, they've
disagreed with the ACIP verdict of "no" in category 4.  

So basically they _widened_ the categories of people to get boosters beyond what the ACIP
recommended.  

I don't quite know how to feel about this:  
- On the one hand, I think the risk of boosters is very low and the benefit is medium if you
  look across the whole population, so that's probably overall favorable.  
- On the other hand, I don't like the agencies overruling their outside expert advisory
  committees and I'd like to see us putting more effort getting first doses into the
  vaccine resistant.  

So I guess I feel&hellip; a bit of both ways, maybe?  

Gonna get a booster myself, though.  You should too, if you're eligible.  

By my [calculation above](#addendum-2021-sep-22-fda-approves-pfizer-boosters), I think
we're up to a bit over half the US population being eligible, so it's not a stretch that
maybe you're probably eligible.
[Here's the list of qualifying medical conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html),
and it's pretty broad.  Even being overweight but not obese, i.e.,
$25 \le \mathrm{BMI} \e 30 \mathrm{kg}/\mathrm{m}^2$, will do.  (Personal point
of reference: my BMI after 1.5 years of staying at home in a pandemic is 28.9.  If you've
gained a few pounds in the last year and a half, you can put those pounds to ironic use
and get a booster.)  

Strange times we live in.  Strange times.  <sup id="fn16a">[[16]](#fn16)</sup>
