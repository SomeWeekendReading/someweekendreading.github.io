Today the Moderna trial of a bivalent classic/Omicron COVID-19 vaccine read out.  Looks
pretty good, so a regulatory filing with the FDA is pending.  

## Finally: An Omicron-specific vaccine  

We've
[kvetched endlessly on this crummy little blog that nobody reads (CLBTNR) about the lack of a vaccine for _current_ viral variants](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/moderna-2022-q1-earnings-call/)
(now just the Omicron subvariants and nothing else).  It seems silly to keep using a vaccine against
a now-presumably-extinct variant from 2019-2020.

However, today is a Very Good Day: we have some positive results on that front.  The
primary source is of course the Moderna press release. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
Because we hate press releases, we'll supplement with coverage from the always-excellent 
Matt Herpet at _STAT News_. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

The now-classic "Spikevax", whose name we love, was initially know by the id mRNA1273.  (I
still have to suppress my reflex of immediately memorizing compound ids so I'll be able to
understand my colleagues.  Having retired from pharma research, I _don't have to do that
any more!_) The new vaccine is bivalent: it contains both the classic Spikevax mRNA
against the classic Wuhan virus, and an Omicron-specific variant.  It is known as
mRNA1273.214.  

Previous bivalent COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna are now zombies, as they worked against
things like classic + Beta, but Beta is now irrelevant.  The virus was literally evolving
faster than we could get vaccines through clinical trials!  

The clinical endpoint of the trial was that it had to be better than mRNA1273: the
geometric mean titer (GMT) of antibodies had to be greater with mRNA1273.214, and even
more stringently, the lower confidence limit on the geometric mean titer ratio (GMR) had
to be greater than 1.  In other words, "do better than the original vaccine" and be 
_really sure_ about that.  

__Result:__ Antibody levels were 8-fold above baseline (when used as a booster on
previously vaccinated individuals).  
- _Against Omicron:_  GMR = 1.75 (97.5% CL: 1.49 - 2.04).  
- _Against classic D614G:_ GMR = 1.22 (97.5% CL: 1.08 - 1.37).  
- _One month later:_ Neutralizing GMT against both was still stronger for mRNA1273.214
  than for mRNA1273.  
- _All other variants:_ Binding antibody titers were higher, with 95% confidence, against
  Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta as well.  

Note the use of an even tighter confidence limit than is traditional: 97.5% vs 95% may
not seem like much, but it means they're really, really, truly sure about this result.

There was a corporate webcast, but I couldn't bring myself to watch all the
corporate-speak.  I have, however, archived their slide presentation here on this 
CLBTNR. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  Looking quickly through it (only 13 slides
including the usual corporate boilerplate nonsense, so really 10 meaningful slides), we
see it confirms the numbers in the press release with some more detail.  Also, as shown
here on slide 8, it shows us the data behind the GMR result in terms of Omicron
neutralizing titers.

Moderna plans a filing with the FDA "in the coming weeks".  On the other hand, the
[FDA meets on 2022-Jun-28 to discuss which variants ought to go into a new vaccine](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/upcoming-vrbpac/).
This is bitterly ironic: Moderna (and presumably Pfizer/BioNTech) have said there's not
enough time to switch now and expect vaccines available in the fall.  So I hope we
manage not to trip over our own tongues, and go along with mRNA1273.214!  

## The Weeekend Conclusion  

So, yeah: pending seeing the actual technical docs, this sure looks like it's superior to
the classic vaccine.  

I _want_ this thing.  I want it for myself, for my family, for my friends, and for all of
humanity.  We should all live, and not die.
