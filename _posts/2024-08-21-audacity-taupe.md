So, Harris at the convention&hellip; I wonder how that's going?  


## Why, the Audacity! (&hellip; Sorta?)  

Once upon a time, in an age that now feels aeons past,
[Barack Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) was president of the United
States.  While notable in many ways, there are 2 particular ways that bear upon the tilling of 
wiseacreage for today:  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-21-audacity-hope-obama-1.jpg" width="200" height="302" alt="Obama: _The Audacity of Hope_" title="Obama: _The Audacity of Hope_" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
1. As a presidential hopeful in 2006, he wrote a book called
   _The Audacity of Hope_. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  Now, like most books by
   or about politicians, I've more or less ignored it.  They tend to be self-serving, or
   content-free, or just trivia writ large.  I'd like to think Obama rose to the occasion
   and wrote a book of substance, but can't vouch for that personally.  

   I merely note for now that the title is from a sermon by Obama's former pastor 
   [Jeremiah Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Wright), whom Republicans
   attempted to demonize during the 2008 election.  Never understood that, either: I
   watched a couple videos of the "controversial" sermons, and found little to which
   anyone reasonable could object.  
   
   So, yeah: Obama took on that situation with the audacity it was due.  

   <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-21-audacity-taupe-obama-2.jpg" width="200" height="138" alt="News photo from 2014, depicting Obama as accused of sartorial criming with a tan suit" title="News photo from 2014, depicting Obama as accused of sartorial criming with a tan suit" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
2. As further proof of Obama's audacity, he was accused of 
   [the sartorial crime of wearing a tan suit while president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_tan_suit_controversy),
   as shown in this news pic from 2014.  
   
   Now, nobody should even _think_ about taking fashion advice from me.  But, really: I
   have absolutely no comprehension of what his critics were thinking!  Even the direct
   quotes sound like parody; some excerpts from Wikipedia:  
   - The regrettable [Lou Dobbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Dobbs) said it was
     "shocking to a lot of people".  
   - The equally regrettable Rep [Peter King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_King_(American_politician)) &ndash;
     obviously Republican &ndash; said it was "unpresidential" and "There's no way, I don't
     think, any of us can excuse what the president did yesterday. I mean, you have the
     world watching."  

   These are the expected responses of right-wing demagogues who cannot accept that a
   Democrat is legitimately president, and who are sufficiently racist that they 
   _absolutely will not_ acknowledge the authority of a Black man.  Including his choice
   of clothing, conservative though it may have been.  

Women, of course, are _always_ criticized for their appearance and clothing.  Now, I don't
know if it's just chance or the wry humor of a campaign genius, but Harris,
possibly relating to Obama in echo of this, wore a tan suit to the Convention:  

<a href="https://x.com/Timodc/status/1825703477739221216"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-21-audacity-taupe-harris-1.jpg" width="550" height="530" alt="Harris at Democratic Convention, in a tan suit" title="Harris at Democratic Convention, in a tan suit" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

The best summaries were riffs on Obama's "Yes, we can!" and "The Audacity of Hope":  
- "Yes, we tan!", and  
- "The Audacity of Taupe"  

Perfect.  10/10.  No notes.  

(That's it.  That's the whole joke.  It doesn't get better with scrutiny.  Just go with it.)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-21-audacity-taupe-the-two-gentlemen.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-21-audacity-taupe-the-two-gentlemen.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="The Two Gentlemen: perfectly comfortable with taupe" title="The Two Gentlemen: perfectly comfortable with taupe" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

As is clear from this picture of the Weekend Publisher (bottom) and the Assistant Weekend
Publisher (top), the Two Gentlemen are perfectly comfortable with taupe, even to the
extent of nominating it as one of their favorite lounging spots.  

However, unlike the Two Gentlemen, we cannot simply rest comfortably.  It is incumbent on
us (eligible American voters, anyway), in the words last night of Michelle Obama, to "do
something about it".  The something we should all do is:  

- Check our voter registrations, probably weekly if you're in a red state or even a red
  county.  
- Vote, preferably early.  If by mail, _drop off your ballot_ with your local elections
  clerk.  There was too much skulduggery in the Post Office delaying mailed ballots last
  time.  
- Vote Democratic, all up and down the ticket.  We need a trifecta (Presidency, Senate,
  and House) in order to do anything.  Republicans will block _everything_ otherwise.  
- Emphatically _do not fail to vote_ and _do not vote 3rd party_.  The only "message"
  you're sending is "I don't care", and giving half a vote for Trump and fascism.  Don't
  do that.
