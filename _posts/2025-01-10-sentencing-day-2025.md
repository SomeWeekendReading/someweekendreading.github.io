So&hellip; Trump Sentencing Day, eh?  


## The Definition of Anti-Climax  

We've in the past written about Trump's criminal
[Indictment Day]({{ site.baseurl }}/indictment-day-2023/), his 
[Arraignment Day]({{site.baseurl }}/arraignment-day-2023/), his
[Conviction Day]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-guilty-nyc/), and hoped for his Sentencing Day.  

Alas, those should have come out in triplets: the NYC hush money case, the federal
insurrection case, and the illegal possession of secret documents case.  The last two have
been stymied by his obstruction of justice and the packed Supreme Court.  However the
first of them is a New York state case, and cannot be obstructed by federal judges.  

However, Trump has managed obstruction of justice to such an extent that there is no
practical sentence than can be meaningfully given, since barring heart attacks he will be
President in another 10 days.  However, it's important to _finish out the process_ so that
he will be fully, and finally, convicted.  

So today Judge Merchan sentenced him, though the only practical sentence was regrettably
unconditional discharge.  On the bright side, it means he is actually a felon, and will
have some impact from that.  

I wonder who will be the first to go after the liquor licenses at Mar A Lago and
Bedminster?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Not the way I thought it would play out.  As it happens, fascists are _extremely_ good at
obstruction of justice.

So now, more than ever: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)
