Does more education help in prying people loose from antisemitism?  Frustratingly, "it
depends."  


## Education _vs_ Antisemitism  

Back when I was just a wee child, I never thought much about antisemitism.  That's partly
because in a small, semi-rural midwestern town there were only a few Jews, all of whom
were culturally indistinguishable from everybody else.  Also, in those days, it was
permissible to think that antisemitism was mostly an issue of the past, largely settle in
World War II with the defeat of the Nazis.  In my na&iuml;vet&eacute; I thought
antisemitism an thing largely of the past or of the stubbornly uneducated.  

It was much in the same sense as we thought of racism: in a mostly-white small town,
racism was not a daily issue for whites, and could be regarded as having been settled by
the Civil War.  

We were, of course, wrong about both.  Racism, post the Civil Rights Act and the Voting
Rights Act, was no longer a _de jure_ matter, but it was most certainly and
viciously present. 

So too with antisemitism.  And, right on time, the Republicans are spouting some deeply
antisemitic rhetoric.

So we might ask the usual questions we liberals ask: isn't just a little bit more
information, a little bit more education, the answer to our problems?  We _always_ ask
this, but sadly trip over multiple obstacles:  
- The [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
  means that the ignorant are full of unearned confidence in their opinions, often
  feeling no need for further information.  
- The [Backfire effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_perseverance) often means
  people are _threatened_ by information that might change their beliefs, and instead dig
  in deeper and tighter in their ignorant positions.  
  
So it might go either way: does education help or hurt the anti-antisemitism project?  


## What the Data Says

The inspiration for today's post comes from an article in
_Research &amp; Politics_  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> that discusses exactly this.  

They study a level of antisemitism in a sample of people, by responses to a survey that
gauge how often (bad) stereotypes about Jews are confirmed.  However, there's a twist:
1. They do this world-wide in over 100 countries, stratifying the antisemitism results by
   country.  
2. Then they  note for each country whether it had endorsed UN resolutions
   condemning Holocaust denial ([UN General Assembly, Session 61, agenda item 44, on Holocaust denial, 2007-Jan-23](https://undocs.org/en/A/61/L.53))
   and condemning antisemitism ([UN General Assembly: Joint Statement against Antisemitism, 2015-Jan-22](https://embassies.gov.il/MFA/InternatlOrgs/Issues/Pages/UN-General-Assembly-Joint-Statement-against-Antisemitism-22-Jan-2015.aspx)).  

It turned out that the effect of education on antisemitism depended strongly on the
national context, getting better in countries that signed on to the antisemitism
resolutions and worse in those that did not (__emphasis__ added):

I'm not going to go through all their data cleaning and modeling, because, frankly, they
did not supply any information to support that.  Their entire paper, including the
supplement, contain not even a single equation!  I just don't get why people think they
can get away with that.  _Sigh._  

So, we have little recourse than to trust, provisionally, the analysis they did and which
they described in a barrage of word salad that I decline to attempt to decrypt.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-17-education-and-antisemitism-rp-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-08-17-education-and-antisemitism-rp-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="134" alt="Figure 1: Stereotype endorsement by education and country support for statements against antisemitism" title="Figure 1: Stereotype endorsement by education and country support for statements against antisemitism" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here's their Figure 1, showing their main result:  
- The leftmost graph is for countries that rejected both resolutions (the most antisemitic
  nations), the middle for those that supported only one, and the right for the countries
  that supported both (the least antisemitic nations).  For our purposes, let's just look
  at the leftmost and rightmost graphs, to get an idea of the range of the effect of
  antisemitism in the host culture.  
- The horizontal axes are age at final year of education, so less educated people are on
  the left of each graph, and more educated people on the right.  
- There are 3 curves: red for people who think the antisemitic stereotypes are mostly
  true, green for those who think they're probably false, and blue for those who don't
  have a clue.  

Let's state our Null Hypothesis (since the authors failed to do so!).  In an ideal world
  where education discouraged antisemitism, we'd expect to see:  
- the red curves fall (agreement with antisemitism falls with education),  
- green curves rise (disagreement with antisemitism rises with education), and  
- blue curves fall (ignorance decreases with education).  

Now, what do we _actually_ see?  
- This is the situation we see on the right.  In countries whose cultures do _not_ encourage
  antisemitism, education works.  
- However, it is _not_ the situation we see on the left, in the countries with antisemitic
  cultures.  While the blue curve does fall (ignorance of the issues decreases), the green
  curve is flat (disagreement with antisemitism not influenced by education), and the red
  curve _rises_ (more education leads to more antisemitism).  

In other words, _education in an antisemitic culture __confirms__ the antisemitic beliefs of
those being educated._  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

It's enough to make me despair.  (Though, to be honest, given the state of the world, that
doesn't take much.)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/teach-arabic-numerals.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/teach-arabic-numerals.jpg" width="400" height="343" alt="Humorous tweet about ignorant American prejudices about 'Arabic numerals'" title="Humorous tweet about ignorant American prejudices about 'Arabic numerals'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
And it's not as though we're immune to this effect in the Western, developed, somewhat
less antisemitic nations.  This tweet humorously summarizes
[a survey by _Civic Science_ from 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/opinion/arabic-numerals.html)
showing the allergic reaction Americans had to the phrase "Arabic numerals" to describe 0,
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  

And lest anyone think this sort of conclusion-jumping is only on the right (though maybe
it's _mostly_ on the right?), a similar prejudice was expressed against the "creation
theories" of the French priest Lema&icirc;tre.  That phrasing is full of bait to make one
suspect the usual conservative religious creation theory crap; in fact
[Georges Lema&icirc;tre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Lema%C3%AEtre),
while genuinely a French priest, was also a physicist involved in the application of
General Relativity to the theory of an expanding universe and ultimately the Big Bang.  It
doesn't get any more respectable than that.  So the suspicion was just my tribe's deep,
and well-earned suspicion of religious nuts messing with education.  

It's as though some part of our minds, mired in the Dark Ages, wishes to use the Dark Arts
of persuasion to inflict the prejudices of our forebears on our offspring.  

Maybe try very hard _not_ to do that?
