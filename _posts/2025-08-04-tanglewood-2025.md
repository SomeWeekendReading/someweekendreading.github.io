We haven't been to Tanglewood in&hellip; approximately forever?  Ok, not for at least a decade.
Last weekend, some friends helped us remedy that whole situation.  


## Arts Reviews on This Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR)  

Apparently, here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, we put up on this CLBTNR about one arts-related
review post per year:  

- For 2024: [the Spectrum Singers finale concert for John Ehrlich]({{ site.baseurl }}/spectrum-singers-2024/).  
- For 2023: [a trip to Symphony Hall to brood over music and the state of the world]({{ site.baseurl }}/symphony-thoughts/).  
- For 2022: [some thoughts about sculptures on the Charles Bridge in Prague]({{ site.baseurl }}/spirit-of-complicated-people/).
  (Also for 2022: [our first return to the BSO in years]({{ site.baseurl }}/return-to-bso/).)  
- For 2021: [about a crazy Finn who makes ephemeral winter sculptures]({{ site.baseurl }}/winter-beauty/).  
- For 2020: [an expedition to western Massachusetts in the autumn (and the seasonally _de rigeur_ pumpkin trebuchet)]({{ site.baseurl }}/in-autumn-in-new-england-thoughts-turn-to/).  

There's nothing deliberate about any of that happening on an approximately annual basis,
and indeed a closer inspection of this CLBTNR, with a charitable eye, might reveal more
arts content.  

But still, here we are.  It's about time for 2025, isn't it?  

_Caveat lector:_  This is a post about a classical music performance.  I am a barbarian in
these matters.  So what you will read here, like the posts above, is more about my
wandering mind's woolgathering, than about the music itself.  For the latter, you must
consult an expert, not me.  

I recognize that in my barbaric capacity, I am a temporary guest at Tanglewood of the
upper class and the culturally sophisticated class.  I may chafe a bit at the former, but
will address the latter respectfully.  

I may not know much about the music, but will do my best to find inspiration of other
worthy topics.  


## Tanglewood _Prolegomena_

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-pool-view-2.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="A pool containing a Weekend Editor, thoroughly swaddled against sun" title="A pool containing a Weekend Editor, thoroughly swaddled against sun" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
First, let us set the stage.  

We have the great good fortune, Chez Weekend, to count as friends a couple who have a
magnificent home [in the Berkshires in western Massachusetts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshires).
Persistently incorrigible habitual readers of this CLBTNR may have noted some grateful episodes in
the past, with beautiful photographs taken from their home.  

Last weekend, they again very generously offered a several-day stay with some other
friends for a weekend of cooking, conversation, swimming, and so on.  You can see the pool
here, with the magnificent view of the hills just over the border in New York.  

It was a lovely time: I brought some Yeats to read, and did a lot of walking in the pool
to exercise my compromised knee without pain.  If you squint carefully, the second picture
shows your humble Weekend Editor in the pool, with a ridiculous amount of sun armor:
Tilley hat, sunglasses, rashguard shirt, and so on.  (That's what happens to you at the
confluence of age and having worked in cancer research for many years: you get a bit
skittish about melanoma.)  

The reading I was doing before and during the trip will set the stage for my
mind-wandering below.  

First, for a variety of reasons, I'd been woolgathering over a favorite passage from
Virgil's [_Aeneid_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid) (Book 6, ll 126ff):  

> &hellip; facilis descensus Averno;  
> noctes atque dies patet atri ianua Ditis;  
> sed revocare gradum superasque evadere ad auras,  
> hoc opus, hic labor est.  
> 
> The descent to hell is easy;  
> Night and day the door of black Dis is open.  
> But to retrace steps and escape into the air,  
> That is the task, this is the hard work.  

Or, as I sarcastically like to translate it (using "damn" not as a vulgar intensifier,
but in its technical theological meaning):  

> Any damn fool can climb down into Hell.  
> Now, getting back out&hellip; __that's__ the hard part!  

I've been known to put that at the front of large-ish software systems, to warn those
about to read themselves into a project: are you _sure_ you want to go down this path?
Alas, that's roughly how I feel about the US right now: possibly on a descent to Hell, but
unlike the son of Anchises, likely to get stuck there.  

Second, because whatever your religion or lack thereof, the notion of Hell is a sticky
one.  We all want to believe in an ultimate moral justice, but the idea of applying that to
ourselves is, or at least _should_ be, a solemn moment.  Consider
[Mephistopheles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephistopheles) in
[Marlowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe)'s play
[_Faustus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Faustus_(play)).  He's "out of Hell" to
tempt Faustus, but "always in Hell" because of his nature and his memories of Heaven:  

   > __Faust.__ How comes it then that thou art out of hell?  
   >  
   > __Meph.__ [Why this is hell, nor am I out of it.](https://www.bartleby.com/lit-hub/hc/dr-faustus/scene-iii/#:~:text=Meph.Why,of%20everlasting%20bliss%3F)  
   > &nbsp;&nbsp; Think’st thou that I who saw the face of God,  
   > &nbsp;&nbsp; And tasted the eternal joys of Heaven,  
   > &nbsp;&nbsp; Am not tormented with ten thousand hells,  
   > &nbsp;&nbsp; In being depriv’d of everlasting bliss?  

I keep telling myself to listen to the voice in the back of my head that sounds like ol'
[GK Chesterton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton): the essential lesson here
is not so much that Mephistopheles remembers hell, but that he remembers _heaven._  

I _hope_ that's the lesson the US will draw after it emerges from a possible
conflagration.  But we've managed to avoid learning it for a couple centuries, now.

Just before we got ready to go to Tanglewood, I'd finished reading the
[WB Yeats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._B._Yeats) poem, 
["The Stolen Child"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stolen_Child), with the refrain
echoing
[the amazing musical setting of this poem by Loreena McKennitt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM0mPtn4uKY):  

> Come away, O human child!  
> To the waters and the wild  
> With a faery, hand in hand,  
> For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.  

Pretty clearly some part of me is thinking about being out of the world.  That was sort of
my mental context: an old man, thinking about the end of life, and what faces the possible
end of democracy in my country.  

(Yes, this is pretty dark, or dark-adjacent material.  But (a) it's _&agrave; propos_ for
the times, and (b) the really hardcore stuff for me is Byron's _Manfred_, which you should
never permit me to read again, ever.)  


## Tanglewood Impressions  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-berkshire-botanical-garden-pond.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-berkshire-botanical-garden-pond-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Berkshire Botanical Garden: calming pond" title="Berkshire Botanical Garden: calming pond" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Tanglewood is like a temple: it hits pretty hard on the symbolic level, starting with the
landscaping.  

If I ignore my theology and let my imagination run wild, I imagine the prologue to an
afterlife as a garden.  It's arranged in a series of "rooms", bordered by hedges and
flowers, perhaps arranged in the shape of
[the 13th century Labyrinth at the Cath&eacute;dral de Chartres](https://www.cathedrale-chartres.org/en/cathedrale/monument/the-labyrinth/).

In each room in  my dream, one can pause to consider the shortcomings of one's life, and what manner of
_tikkun_ is required to repair it.  Perhaps each room features a psychoactive tea
from the plants growing there, [empathogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entactogen) or
[entheogenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entheogen) in their effects.  At
the center of the labyrinth, we eventually reach&hellip; _something._  

This is what I think about in formal gardens.  (Yes, I am peculiar; feel free to laugh, if
you like.  Go ahead, I'll wait.) The garden shown here is at the 
[Berkshire Botanical Garden](https://www.berkshirebotanical.org/), also worth a visit
should you ever find yourself in the Berkshires with some part of eternity to spare and
want to walk some garden rooms to assess yourself.  

Of course, no formal garden is completely free of topiary madness, as one can see here.
(Who's gonna sit in that giant hedge-chair?!) I don't quite know why this is always the
case, but I suspect it's for the same reason I have Lewis Carroll in a place of honor on my
bookshelf.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-topiary-madness-with-trees.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Tanglewood: topiary madness with trees" title="Tanglewood: topiary madness with trees" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
But at Tanglewood, the gardeners take surreal formal gardening quite a few steps further,
apparently engaging in topiary madness with actual, full-sized _trees._  

I'm sure there's some "explanation" of the right-angle madness with which this tree has
been trained, and I'm curious to know what it is.  In the meantime, we'll just enjoy the
ambiguity and dream of the reasons, as
[Cabell wrote in _Something About Eve: A Comedy of Fig-Leaves_](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/69779):  

> After dark, Antan always displayed eight lights, six of them grouped together in the
> middle of the vista with the general effect of a cross, and the other two showing much
> farther off to the northwest. About those never-varying lights Gerald had formed at
> least twenty delightful theories, all plausible as long as you remained upon Mispec
> Moor, whereas if you went to Antan not more at most than one of these theories could
> prove true.  
>  
> To go to Antan thus meant the destruction of no less than nineteen rather beautiful
> ideas as to those lights alone.  
> &ndash; [JB Cabell, _Something About Eve_, Chapter 37](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69779/pg69779-images.html#ch37:~:text=For%20one%20matter%2C%20after,to%20those%20lights%20alone.)  

Absent a formal garden tour, we'll just have to enjoy the topiary ambiguity.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-seiji-ozawa.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Tanglewood bust of Seiji Ozawa" title="Tanglewood bust of Seiji Ozawa" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Other sights include monuments to musical stars of the BSO and Tanglewood, such as Seiji
Ozawa, seen here.  He was unquestionably a giant of classical music in Boston, having
been the BSO music director for 29 years.  He preferred to be called "Seiji", rather than
the usual "maestro".  

However, what I've read of him described his leadership style as being on the "autocratic"
and "erratic" style.  In particular, there was apparently
[quite a deep conflict with the faculty at Tanglewood](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/05/arts/tanglewood-is-divided-over-moves-by-ozawa.html),
so it's ironic to see his bust displayed so prominently here.  

Perhaps both sides forgave each other.  Or so one can hope.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-moonlight.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="Tanglewood on the half-moon" title="Tanglewood on the half-moon" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Since it was a midsummer's night &ndash; though without Puck &ndash; it was nice to see a
summer half-moon.  I believe
[the name for the August full moon is the "Sturgeon Moon"](https://astrobackyard.com/full-moon-names/),
so we are attending Tanglewood Under the Half-Sturgeon Moon&hellip; which is somewhat
lacking, poetically, rhetorically, and astronomically.  (Though it would be fun to
fantasize that it's named after [Ted Sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Sturgeon).)
So let's just go with a beautiful moonlit midsummer's eve, and let the Shakespearean echoes
rattle about us.  

There's a great deal more to be seen on the Tanglewood grounds, but we lacked time and
daylight to capture much more.  In particular, there are a couple of interesting mansions
and a formal garden.  (And now you know how I react to formal gardens, so you understand
why I want to see that sometime during the daylight!)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-welcome.jpg" width="400" height="573" alt="Tanglewood welcome: no discrimination or harassment" title="Tanglewood welcome: no discrimination or harassment" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
In these degenerate days, diversity/equity/inclusion (DEI) and wokeness (awareness of, and
intent to do something about, _structural_ racism) have been turned into rage-spittle epithets
by American Republicans.  

So it's nice to see, as shown here, that Tanglewood has not yet bent the knee to
Gadianton.  This sign, right after "Welcome to Tanglewood" is one of the first things that
greets you: discrimination or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.  (Though I'm
not sure what the lion's all about?)  

It's also nice to see a public acknowledgment of the idea of a _commons,_ here in the
claim that "music belongs to everyone".  Let us hope we are not about to re-enact the
[_Tragedy of the Commons_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons#:~:text=The%20tragedy%20of%20the%20commons,up%20destroying%20its%20value%20altogether.).  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-sothebys.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tanglewood: pre-concert advertisement for Sotheby's real estate; we are DEFINITELY guests of the upper class!" title="Tanglewood: pre-concert advertisement for Sotheby's real estate; we are DEFINITELY guests of the upper class!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Still&hellip; it's very much a class thing.  When the giant video monitors start
advertising Sotheby's international realty business, you know you're among the 1%.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-shed.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tanglewood: The 'Shed'" title="Tanglewood: The 'Shed'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-lawn.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Tanglewood: The 'Lawn'" title="Tanglewood: The 'Lawn'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
To some extent, this is reflected in the seating arrangements. 
- At higher cost, you can purchase 'shed' tickets, which are under the roof of an open-air
  facility.  It is yclept 'the shed' with the _faux_ modesty of yesteryear's upper class.
  In fact, it is an engineering marvel of acoustics which manages to be echo-free,
  amplifying and focusing the sound from the stage both within the shed itself as well as
  pushing out significant sound to the lawn.  
- At more ordinary cost, there are 'lawn' tickets.  The beautifully manicured lawn around
  the shed is used as a picnic space before concerts, and as a blanketed spectator space
  during the concerts.  This area also has its subtle technological marvels:
  - The acoustics are some mix of speakers and direct sound from within the shed whose
    nature I didn't divine: they managed to make coherent sound over a large area without
    distortions, delays, or echos.  
	
	If you've ever had 2 Zoom calls in the same room, you know how difficult that is!  
  - The screens show you what's going on at the stage, with various views from either a shed
    spectator's or the musician's point of view.  What's interesting about that is that,
    while they can be seen clearly after dark, they can _also_ be seen before sunset, when
    they are in full sunlight.  Have a look at that Sotheby's advertisement above: that
    picture was taken of a a western-facing monitor _in full sunlight,_ but still bright enough
    that it can be seen!  
	
	This is&hellip; extraordinary.  I wonder how long it's been that good?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-altar.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Some people take the lawn picnic VERY seriously" title="Some people take the lawn picnic VERY seriously" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Our hosts, who are about as down-to-earth as one can get, have the usual social class
stories one encounters at Tanglewood.  Once they were wheeling in their picnic cart (yes,
people have "picnic baskets" that require wheeled carts, example shown here).  A couple of
"blue-haired old ladies" were overheard to say, "Oh, look!  The _lawn people_ are here."  

So&hellip; yeah.  We're the _lawn people._ And proud of it.  

Remember the picnic baskets that required something the sizes of a shopping cart to move
about?  Some people take this _really seriously_, complete with candelabra.  Shown here is
one such construct, strongly resembling a religious altar.  It was conspicuous enough to
be useful to me as a navigational beacon in the dark, upon returning from the restroom.
In a way, it _was_ an altar, to a refined culture.  Yes, Tanglewood is a mixed message
about class, but it also teaches very high cultural tastes. (Yes, I know that is very
non-postmodern of me.  I am, in fact, very much non-postmodern; mild but unreconstructed
fan of structuralism, in some ways.)  


## The Music  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-program.jpg" width="400" height="594" alt="Tanglewood Program 2025-Aug-01: Korngold &amp; Rachmaninoff" title="Tanglewood Program 2025-Aug-01: Korngold &amp; Rachmaninoff" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Here's the program for the evening's revels.  

There were 2 rather big pieces performed:  
- [Erich Korngold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Wolfgang_Korngold)'s 
  [Violin Concerto in D, Opus 35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_Concerto_(Korngold)).

  I knew nothing of Korngold (let alone this particular piece), and didn't want to be That
  Guy reading the program notes by the light of my phone instead of listening.  Nor will I
  pretend to know what I'm talking about after reading a couple Wikipedia articles.
  Suffice to say that it was good, though I'm unlikely to have appreciated much of the
  nuance, being a barbarian.  
  
  I do note, however, that Korngold was born in 1897, composed this in 1937 at about
  age 40.  This will be interesting momentarily.  
- [Sergei Rachmaninoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Rachmaninoff)'s 
  [Symphony No. 2 in E Minor, Opus 27](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._2_(Rachmaninoff)).

  I've at least _heard_ of Rachmaninoff, to the extent that I can even spell his name, in
  some Romanization or other of the Cyrillic original.  Again, it was a pleasant
  experience, but my barbarian limitations prevent me from having much of anything useful
  to say about it.  

  Again I note that Rachmaninoff was born in 1873, composed this piece in 1906-1907 at
  about age 33-34.  Hold onto that fact, too.  
- The guest conductor for the evening was [Elim Chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elim_Chan).

  Again, I knew nothing of her before this, because&hellip; you know, barbarian here.  Her
  biography says something like "born in Hong Kong, went to Smith, conducted here, and
  here, and here, and here, &hellip;" and so on.  In other words, she's conducted just
  about _every_ major world orchestra.  You don't get invited to do that without having
  _something_ going on, so I kind of wanted to see what it was (_q.v.)._  

  She was born in 1986, and was 38 years old on the night of the concert.  

Society often thinks of classical music as something like "music for old rich people".  

But note the ages here: Korngold composing at age 40, Rachmaninoff composing at age 33-34,
and Chan conducting at age 38.  All in their mid to late 30s (very mildly stretching a
point for Korngold), _they are each of comparably young ages!_ Sure, this is adult
music, but it was composed, conducted, and to an extent performed by young-ish adult
people.  

So the "music for old rich people" thing is another shibboleth to let go.  


## The Experience (Through Barbarian Eyes)  

Perhaps in my capacity as Guest Barbarian, I may point out some side aspects to the
concert that those of you who are more musically baptized did not see?  

### The Players  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-down-jacket.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Someone in the first violins is _technically_ in compliance with the dress code&hellip;" title="Someone in the first violins is _technically_ in compliance with the dress code&hellip;" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
It gets cold(ish) at night in the Berkshires.  At least, according to the Weekend Editrix.
According to me, 60-65&deg;F is quite comfortable.  But, apparently this is a minority opinion.  

For musicians, this is an issue: like athletes, they must keep their muscles
warm to perform properly.  So check out the violinist, in technical compliance with the
dress code colors, wearing a down jacket.  In August, but she knows what she's doing!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-percussion-brass-war.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Bulletproof shields between brass and tympanis?" title="Bulletproof shields between brass and tympanis?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Next, note the plastic barrier behind the heads of the brass players, in front of the tympani.
Probably it's to prevent going home with a headache from having your head inside a tympani
all day.  

But&hellip; my over-active imagination demands a better reason:  

> In the eternal war between percussionists and brass, the tympanists occasionally express
> their disapproval with small arms fire.  This was brought to an end with a treaty
> establishing a light bulletproof screen.  Should the tympanists violate this treaty, the
> brass players will reach under their seats to pull out the __bazookaphone,__ an instrument
> usually reserved for the Boston Pops 4th of July concert on the Esplanade, in the artillery
> movement of the 1812 Overture.  

There.  Isn't that more fun than "don't go home feeling like you're 
[that guy inside the drum in _The 5000 Fingers of Doctor T"_](https://scifiwright.com/2016/03/the-debaculous-fiasco-of-dr-seuss/#:~:text=I%20saw%20about%C2%A0to%20the%20scene%C2%A0where%20a%20drummer%20is%20being%20tortured%20forever%20inside%20a%20giant%20drum%2C%20and%20the%20orchestra%20is%20playing%20bizarre%20instruments%20only%20Dr.%20Seuss%20could%20dream%20up%2C%20including%20a%20cymbal%20worked%20by%20a%20man%20on%20the%20flying%20trapeze.)
(which is what my childhood musical education was like)?  

### The Conductor  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-chan-1.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Conductor Elim Chan: tiny woman, on platform, in heels" title="Conductor Elim Chan: tiny woman, on platform, in heels" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
First, we must note that Elim Chan is a _tiny person._  

Here we see her on the stand behind the podium, wearing heels.  (Those are thick heels,
like the Cuban heels of my long-ago youth, because she will be jumping about quite a
bit. Stiletto heels would pose a danger to her and to all nearby.)  

Note that, with both of those effects, she is still shorter than Leonidas Kavakos, the
violin soloist.  When they embraced at the end of the piece (which I unfortunately did not
capture, because I am a _terrible_ photographer), he was _still_ taller than her.  

I think being tiny has made her feel she must prove herself physically, leading to a very
kinetic conducting style that's fun for the audience to watch.  (The musicians seemed pretty
ok with it, as well.)

She also wears her hair in a ponytail, which is in full fling, flying about as she
conducts as you can see here.  I'm pretty sure this is a deliberate, choreographed effect
she employs to have a larger physical presence.  

Honestly, she reminds me of Natalie Merchant in her long-ago _10,000 Maniacs_ days.  She
would dance while she sang, and fling her hair about in a _completely_ captivating way.
Here's an example singing "Don't Talk"
[from her YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ75F_MdJYc).  (If the music
isn't entirely to your taste, just briefly consider her dancing at 1:30.)  It's so _clear_ she's
having an absolutely wonderful time, you can't help but feel the same.  

Chan is, I believe perhaps consciously, attempting to convey that same joy and enthusiasm
by &ndash; _almost_ &ndash; turning her conducting into a dance performance.
Understanding whether she's dancing for the musicians or for the listeners is above my pay
grade.

Occasionally, the camera from the viewpoint of the musicians catches here in an intense
look, like the one shown here.  You'd do what she asked too, if she looked at you like
that!  There were several other moments which I failed to capture photographically (again
because I'm awful with a camera):  
- At one point, she grinned at the horns just after a particularly showy passage.  I
  imagined her congratulating them, saying:  
  
  > Yeah, you just did that.  I heard it.  __Everybody__ heard it!  You're cool.  
  
- She apparently does not use a baton, or at least did not for this performance.  She has
  at least 10 batons, called "fingers".  

  At the beginning of one movement, we saw her grin at the musicians, and tug up each
  sleeve, in the classic "nothing up my sleeves" move beloved of stage magicians.  I imagined
  her saying:  

  > See?  Nothing up my sleeves.  No baton!  I don't __need__ a magic wand to work magic
  > on you.  I can squeeze Rachmaninoff out of you with the strength of my __bare hands!__  

One (minor) odd note: With a conducting style that kinetic, she
has to raise her arms quickly many times, leading to her otherwise lovely silk blouse
becoming untucked from her nice long black skirt.  So she conspicuously tucked it back in,
at the end of every movement.  Someone get this woman a tunic!  She needs a top that does
something like cinch at the waist, but then flow over the skirt, perhaps even with a
weighted border (as [the British royals are rumo(u)red to do with skirts and kilts](https://www.womansworld.com/entertainment/royals/weird-royal-fashion-hacks#:~:text=Queen%20Elizabeth%20used%20curtain%20weights%20to%20keep%20her%20dresses%20in%20place.)).  

But fine; we might as well tell her, "If you're gonna be this interesting to watch, then
tuck all you want.  We'll wait."  I could watch her conduct a _pretend_ orchestra with no
sound, just for the choreography.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-04-tanglewood-2025-publishers-in-box-seats.jpg" width="400" height="533" alt="The Weekend Publisher and the Assistant Weekend Publisher, in their customary box seats" title="The Weekend Publisher and the Assistant Weekend Publisher, in their customary box seats" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The true _aristoi_ Chez Weekend are, of course, the Weekend Publisher and the Assistant
Weekend Publisher, shown here.  

Not for them the plebeian lawn seats!  Oh, no: they are seen here ensconced in their
customary box seats from which they may survey and judge the _hoi polloi_, who are both
physically beneath them and socially _infra dig._  

In case you're curious about the sound track backing the writing of this post, start with, e.g.,
[Michelle McLaughlin, "Middle Way", from _The Beginning of Forever_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLsAnrcwgW8)
and variations suggested by one of my Pandora channels.  

Not really the same, of course, as what we heard at Tanglewood.  But sometimes this sort
of ambient piano music puts me in a spiritual frame of mind.  

Sort of like a formal garden. :-)  

So that was our trip to Tanglewood, with lovely friends.  Or at least, it's what I can
perceive in my musical barbarian state.

Nope.
