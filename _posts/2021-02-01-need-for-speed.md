Vaccine rollouts worldwide, with very few exceptions, have been slow &amp; bungled.  But
we face a cruel equation: delay = death.  Why do we tolerate this?  

The longer we take to vaccinate _the entire world_, the more people die from COVID
classic, and the more potential vaccine resistance mutations show up in the SARS-CoV-2
virus.  Indeed, slow vaccination is the _ideal situation_ for creating resistance
mutations: maximal selective pressure on the virus to mutate, and lots of new people to infect 
always available.  

So why are we bungling it world-wide?  


## COVID fatigue and needless death rates  

Remember [about a month ago, we reported on this blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/youre-scaring-me/#not-just-your-body-your-choice-you-live-with-the-rest-of-us) 
that there was evidence of COVID fatigue in France among the 20-somethings leading to
massive infections and deaths in the elderly?

    A fascinating graph, showing the dynamics of the second wave in France. <br><br>

    Things were fine in July, but the 20-29 year olds starting relaxing.<br><br>

    Over time, they contaminated older generations until infection rates were high for all. <br><br>

    How will the reverse movement proceed?

Now [Guillaume Pressiat, writing on his blog alt-R native](https://guillaumepressiat.github.io/blog/2021/01/covidview-si-dep-echarts4r)
(which I discovered via [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)), presents us with
an [R/Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app that's kept up to date with data from
[Sant&eacute; Publique France](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/taux-dincidence-de-lepidemie-de-covid-19/).
Things really haven't gotten much better for the French elderly, as you can see.  The US
is probably similar, but we don't have organized ways to make the data available with each
state (and sometimes county!) being a separate fiefdom.  

If you find yourself in the 20-something demographic and are for some reason reading this
blog (Why?!  Please tell me in the comments, because I'm really curious about you!), I
have a message for you from your elders.  

We elders understand that you need to hang with
your friends, and sometimes get a little rowdy.  It's a time-of-life thing.  We did it
too, long ago.  So honest, we understand your need and are prepared to be reasonably
sympathetic.  But please: hold off on the wild parties until we all get vaccinated, ok?
Because those are Granny Murder Parties, and your grammas don't wanna die.
("Morituri&hellip; nolumus mori", in the immortal words of the regrettably mortal
[Terry Pratchett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett).)  

Once we're all vaccinated, then you can cut loose with our blessing.  I mean, sure, I'm still
gonna shake my fist and yell 
["You kids get off my lawn"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_kids_get_off_my_lawn!), 
and you'll still reply ["OK, boomer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_boomer)&hellip; 
but we'll both be doing it _ironically_.  We'll both still be alive to say that, and
happily so.  It'll be a good time for both of us.  Promise.  Just hang on a little longer.  


## Vaccinating all of humanity  

Here's the thing about vaccines in the modern world: unless you vaccinate pretty much _all
of humanity_, you've left a reservoir of susceptible people where the virus can multiply
and mutate.  Sooner or later, that will develop a vaccine resistance mutation and it will
come back to bite us.  So, look: first, good care for everybody is just the right thing to
do; second, it's also the only sensible thing to keep the vaccinated population safe.  

That's why this tweet a few weeks ago from Amy Maxmen, who reports for _Nature_, was so
disheartening:

We're replicating the structural discrimination of colonialism, and creating reservoirs of
unvaccinated people where the virus can continue to mutate.  This is both wrong
fundamentally in the way the rich treat the poor, but it's also rotten strategy even for
the rich to keep themselves safe.  

Israel is proof that this can be done.  They're vaccinating everybody, there's an orderly
system that tells you when &amp; where to show up, and there's a plan for unused doses at
the end of the day.  (Basically: nurses go out into the street and yell for anybody who
wants a vaccine to _come here right now_.  I've even heard of nurses yelling, "Hey, pizza guy: want
a vaccine?" to delivery persons.)  Now Israel has lots and lots of other problems, with
many sorts of structural discrimination against the Palestinians.  But at least in this
instance, they know rapid vaccination leads to declines in infection, hospitalization, and
death rates.  _This is how it's done._

It can even be done here in the US, where sometimes I feel like it's almost impossible to
get anything done right.  Some examples:  
- Some health care workers in Oregon, transporting vaccines, were stuck in snow on a
  highway where a bunch of others got stuck too.  Rather than waste the vaccine, they
  found a doctor among the other drivers to supervise, and offered the vaccine to everyone
  in their cars, while they were waiting for a snowplow. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
   _This is how it's done._
- A freezer failure in Seattle put 1650 doses of the Moderna vaccine in danger late at
  night.  They were split between Seattle University and University of Washington, who put
  out calls on the news for people to come in at 11pm - 2am to get vaccinated.  And people
  did: sometimes in bathrobes. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  All doses were used.
  _This is how it's done._
  
_Vaccinate everybody._  (Yeah, I know: I'm being hopelessly na&iuml;ve about the
anti-vaxers and those with a (sometimes justified) suspicion of Western medicine.   But
the anti-vaxers, at least, are already hopeless.
[Think of it as evolution in action.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_Fealty_(novel)))  


## Resistance ahoy!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-02-01-need-for-speed-nyt-2.jpg" width="400" height="508" alt="NYT: virus mutations will need changed vaccines" title="NYT: virus mutations will need changed vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>

The resistance mutations are already here, both in the B.1.1.7 (UK) and B.1.351 (South
Africa) variants.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  We know they affect vaccine efficacy, 
though for now at least the mRNA vaccines _seem_ to be working. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

As we saw just a couple days ago, the J&amp;J vaccine dips down to an alarmingly low
efficacy of 57% against the South African variant.  Our data on the mRNA vaccines from
Pfizer &amp; Moderna is largely _in vitro_ 
([as we blogged about last month]({{ site.baseurl }}/coronavirus-mutation-vs-vaccine/)).
But since those trials happened before the new
variants got out much, we don't really know their efficacy _in vivo_.  

In some ways, this is the most frightening phase of the whole pandemic.  While we're
applying the vaccine to ourselves, that's applying evolutionary selective pressure on the
virus to find an escape mutation that makes it vaccine resistant.  And because most of
humanity is not yet vaccinated, there are plenty of people for those new variants to
infect, as they are currently doing.  

Vaccinating slowly means we're pressuring the virus to change, and providing plenty of
willing victims into whom it can spread.  Only when substantially everyone (including the
developed world) is vaccinated will there be herd immunity, where the virus can't spread.
Hence: delay = death.  So if you don't want a more virulent and mutated resistant vaccine,
don't delay vaccines!  

Yes, it's true: the mRNA vaccines are made largely by RNA synthesizers, which are
basically machines into which you program the sequence of RNA you want.  BioNTech says
they can spin up a new variant vaccine in about 6 weeks (see the _NYT_ article).  Moderna
is already starting that (see the MedicalXPress article).  That's for the _design_ of a
new vaccine; the actual manufacturing is quite complex and requires facilities that are
already busy, as Derek Lowe explains in a nice little tutorial on mRNA vaccine
manufacturing steps at _In the Pipeline_. <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>

But, there are at least 2 other problems even if we _could_ make lots more vaccines fast:  
1. Everybody would need to get vaccinated _again_, and  
2. Regulatory frameworks would require a new Phase 3 clinical trial, taking maybe 6-9 months.  

So we have to clean up our act in both of those regards for the scientific fact of nimble
mRNA vaccine design to be of benefit to us.  


## Weirdly bungled vaccine rollouts

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-02-01-need-for-speed-bbc.jpg" width="400" height="410" alt="BBC: Why is EU vaccine rollout so slow?" title="BBC: Why is EU vaccine rollout so slow?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-02-01-need-for-speed-stat.jpg" width="400" height="403" alt="STAT News: utter chaos searching for COVID vaccine appointment" title="STAT News: utter chaos searching for COVID vaccine appointment" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
If it's that crucial, why does the rollout seem to be slow and bungled, worldwide?  (Ok,
except for Israel (which is vaccinating fast), and New Zealand (which isolated fast).)  

There seem to be multiple delays in delivery from multiple vaccine vendors in
the European Union. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  Frustratingly, when you drill down
to look at Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, there seem to be different causes for delay
and shortages in each case.  Nonetheless, it's understandably infuriating when _all_ of
them _simultaneously_ slow down deliveries, and that's going to cause considerable
politial anger in the EU.  They're already testing tempers about vaccine exports out of
the EU, and even across borders within the EU.  Hungary has gotten so desparate they've
begun purchasing the Russian Sputnik V vaccine.  

In the US, it's just as chaotic: there's no national plan for vaccine sites, mostly
because Trump didn't think it was his job and pushed it down to the states.  Some states,
like Florida, have gone further and pushed the whole thing down to the county level.  How
much of a budget for mass vaccination do you think county health boards have?  Do you
think there will be a difference between rich and poor counties?  

_STAT News_ has a story of a physician in Phoenix who dived into the chaos, trying to find
vaccination appointments for her mother in California.  <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
It _took her 4 days_, and she's a physician who knows how to work the system.  'Just utter
chaos', indeed.  

This is not an isolated case; it's _typical_ of the state of the US.  We
can't figure out how to get organized enough to get the vaccine into arms.  I hope we'll
get better with time; after all, we've only recently resurrected the very idea of having
an organized national government about 10 days ago.  

## Bizarre resistance to vaccinations

As if that's not enough: a bizarre farrago of anti-vaxers and far-right groups actually
shut down the mass vaccination site at Dodgers Statdium in Los Angeles.
<sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  I&hellip; Just. Can't. Even.  

[PZ Myers had a thought or two on this over at Pharyngula](https://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2021/02/02/facebook-is-irresponsible-zuckerberg-deserves-to-rot-in-hell/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+freethoughtblogs%2Fpharyngula+%28FTB%3A+Pharyngula%29).  Spoiler: he didn't like it either.  

Fortunately, all the doses were given out and no appointments were cancelled.  Lots of
tempers were frayed by the floridly performative stupidity and pointlessness.  


## What to do  

Look, just get vaccinated.  I know it's hard.  Believe me, I've been poking at the
upcoming possibility of vaccination eligibility for myself, so I understand personally.
But just fight through the BS and get it done.  Ask for help if you need it.  

In the meantime, 
[you know what to do to keep safe]({{ site.baseurl }}/youre-scaring-me/#what-you-can-do).
So keep doing that.  If you haven't been doing that, _start now_.  (Ok, the voting part of
that advice is now settled.  But do the rest.)  

Someday soon I'll be able to yell
["You kids get off my lawn"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_kids_get_off_my_lawn!), 
you can give the _de rigeur_ bored riposte ["OK, boomer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK_boomer).
We'll both grin like maniacs because we _lived through COVID_.  That'll be _fun_.  

As Fauci said to the _NYT_ <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>:  
>"If ever there was reason to vaccinate as many people as expeditiously as we possibly can with the vaccine that we have right now, now is the time," Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said in an interview. "Because the less people that get infected, the less chance you’re going to give this particular mutant a chance to become dominant."
