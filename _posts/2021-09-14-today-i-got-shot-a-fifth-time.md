Today I got shot for the _fifth_ time this year.  Again, not guns and not COVID, execrable
as they both are.  Influenza vaccination this time.  


## Flu vaccines: they're for everybody  

As usual, [XKCD #2515 properly summarizes everything](https://xkcd.com/2515/) in just a
few words, and even fewer lines:  
!["XKCD: vaccines actually work"](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/vaccine_research.png "XKCD: vaccines actually work")

Influenza, a.k.a. "the flu", is not trivial.  It's a respiratory virus that in a typical
year infects 5-15% of humanity, with about 3-5 million severe cases annually, and
something around 650,000 deaths world-wide
([according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza)).  We tend to dismiss
it as "just the flu", but numbers like that are nothing to sneeze at.  (Ahem.)  

Also, there's almost certain to be a 4th wave of COVID-19 in the US this winter, as people
in the north go back inside into rooms with limited ventilation, which are also partially
populated by unvaccinated knuckleheads.  Look, at this point you have ony 3 alternatives:  
- either you've already had COVID and are somewhat immune,  
- or you're vaccinated and are pretty well immune,  
- or _you're going to catch the Delta variant_.  

There is no 4th alternative in which you're not already somehow immune and yet you somehow
evade Delta.  None.  

That being the case, you really don't want to show up at a hospital as another febrile
patient with a cough and a fever.  In fact, you don't want to show up at a hospital at
all, especially in the American South and the mountain West: those hospitals are full of
unvaccinated knuckleheads with COVID.  People are being turned away from hospitals, even
with severe injuries, from which they sometimes die because the knuckleheads have clogged
the healthcare system.  


## Everybody includes me  

So, trying to be a reasonably smart boy with a good survival instinct, I got a
flu shot today.  

"Isn't it a bit early in the season?" the Weekend Editrix asked.  Sure, but that's all the
better: give my immune system a chance to build itself up _before_ flu becomes an issue.

I asked the pharmacist if I could take a picture of the box from which my dose came, for this blog.
She said sure, but wanted to get a fresh box so the pharmacy would look better.  So this
isn't _exactly_ the box from which my personal syringe full of not-the-flu came, but it was
probably the one next to it in the freezer.  

The funny word "quadrivalent" means it immunizes against 4 strains of influenza.  Each
year, we have to make a prediction/guess about which strains will make it into our winter
and become a problem.  Sometimes we get it right, sometimes not.  This year it's 4
different strains that look like the mooks we want to avoid.  Every year it's different,
since the flu viruses mutate so fast, jumping from chickens & ducks to pigs to
humans. (Especially in Asia, where integrated agriculture is still common.)  

And do you see that blue box in the upper right, the one that says this is the "geezer
version"?  We elders have typically somewhat weaker immune systems.  So they crank up the
dose given to our immune system, to smack it around a little and make sure the not-the-flu
message gets through.  I am now the happy recipient of _4 times the dose_ given to the youngs!  

It's only been a couple hours and my arm is a little bit sore already; tomorrow promises
to be interesting.  And I mean "interesting" in the sense of "feel a bit crappy and spend
the day on the couch with Netflix" as opposed to remaining unvaccinated and
having an even _more_ "interesting" near-death experience this winter.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

All good.  It took the pharmacists a while to figure out my insurance: they kept
trying to use Medicare Part B instead of Part C, despite my mild-mannered suggestions to
the contrary.  As with most American medicine, insurance is the biggest problem; the
actual care is ok.  

Now the trick will be to convince the Weekend Editrix to get hers.  Wish me luck.  


## Addendum 2021-Sep-15: Side Effects  

Minimal, really.  

Last night I had a sore arm, and was a little bit tired &amp; achy.  Nothing terrible,
just enough to plant my behind on the couch with some tomes of hypergeometric functions.  

Today I felt pretty normal.  That turned out not to be the case, since the exercise &amp;
yoga class in the early evening really exhausted me more than usual.  Still, a couple
hours later&hellip; I'm fine.  

Flu vaccinations: highly recommended.  Get yours, too.
