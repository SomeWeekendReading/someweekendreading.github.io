So, I briefly left the country, and y'all put in a new President.  How's that working out
after 1 week?  


## Return from Japan to Find&hellip;  

Yes, we went to Japan to visit family, about which more later.  

Suffice for now that we arrived back in the US about 8 hours after the inauguration.
Honestly, I was kind of scared.  Yes, we are utterly, completely, and scrupulously legal:  
- I had recently renewed my US passport, so it's got 10 years to go on it.  
- Yes, my spouse had recently renewed here Japanese passport, so it's got about 10 years
  go to on it.  
- Yes, my spouse had recently renewed her green card, _and used it_, so we knew it worked
  and had about 10 years to go on it.  

_Entry to Japan:_ It was pretty easy, actually.  They noted my cane, and with their overly florid
consideration for the elderly, directed me to a priority immigration lane.  Later, I waved
around my phone with the QR code that showed I'd filled out the customs forms ahead of
time.  I think they were a bit shocked to see a _gaijin_ who actually played by their
rules.  So they sent me to the customs lane where nobody was present and I could just walk
right into Japan.  Very easy.  

_Entry to the US:_ This was what had me slightly scared.  Border control officials noted my cane
and directed both of us to a priority line, rather ot my surprise.  They actually sent us
through the _diplomatic_ line, which looked like a dodgy thing to do.  But the official
noted the cane, the recent passports, the recent green card, and just nodded
after the ceremonial photograph.  

Still&hellip; against the lawless, being lawful is a slim defense. And lawlessness appears
to be what now prevails in the US:  
- attempts to ignore the [Impoundment Control Act of 1974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_and_Impoundment_Control_Act_of_1974)
  (and yes, I personally remember Nixon's attempts at this),  
- firing the Inspectors General so they can't report on corruption,  
- mass intimidation and threats to federal employees,  
- attempts to replace career civil employees with illegal political cronies,  
- wildly extreme rhetoric (transition referred to as "genital mutilation", scientific
  grants called "Marxist"),  
- proposed cabinet level appointments of proudly misogynistic and racist scum,  
- absurdly delusional policy decisions (such as the shutdown of almost all medical
  research, including life-critical clinical trials).  

It just never ends.

WH Auden seems to have captured this moment in poetry.  Like his 
["September 1, 1939" which we've used previously on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/greens-asymmetry/#point-the-agony-of-today),
Auden also captured a lot of the nature of our contemptible leaders in the hell-year of 1968:  

>["August 1968"](https://allpoetry.com/August-1968)  
>  
>The Ogre does what ogres can,  
>Deeds quite impossible for Man,  
>But one prize is beyond his reach,  
>The Ogre cannot master Speech:  
>About a subjugated plain,  
>Among its desperate and slain,  
>The Ogre stalks with hands on hips,  
>While drivel gushes from his lips.  
>  
> &ndash;  [WH Auden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._H._Auden)  

The ogre has power.  But the ogre is stupid.  

Is he stupid enough that he can be induced to incapacitate himself?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

We all desperately seek [_phronesis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phronesis)
sufficient for the times.  Auden again:
["undo the folded lie"]({{ site.baseurl }}/greens-asymmetry/#:~:text=a%20voice%0ATo-,undo%20the%20folded%20lie,-%2C%0AThe%20romantic)!  

As long as we're on a late 60s kick with Auden, maybe we should resurrect a slogan from my
youth and re-target it from Nixon to the FFOTUS (First Felon of the United States):  

> _Jail to the chief!_

Nope.
