So, Biden/Trump debate, eh?  


## My Debate Strategy  

Look, I didn't watch it.  

I took a long hot bath and went to bed.  

I've had it up to _here_ with Trump's lies, dishonesty, sociopathy, narcissism, and
neo-Nazism.  Biden wasn't my first choice last time around, either (nor my second, but
he's what the system produced).  And he's been a reasonably effective president,
especially given a Congress full of authoritarian idiots.  

But I just can't bring myself to marinate in the word salad that is the inevitable result
of good presidential debates, and this was in no way a good one.  It's always a gamble,
and I see no point in gambling of almost any sort, let alone important things like this.  

People spend their lives getting good at facts or good at words.  I'm one of the former,
having spent my life in various mathematical and logical or math/logic-adjacent
pursuits. But for no particularly obvious reason, it's always the Word People that
take power.  I have almost no interest in what they _say_, but an intense interest in what
they will _do_.  Debates are a worthless emotional rollercoaster in that regard.  

Also: Trump lies repeatedly, the way real people breathe.  
- A debate happens in real time, where he can't be fact-checked, so his words are
  worthless.  (Sort of like today's generation of AIs, a fountain of BS.)  
- When lying fast over and over is a winning strategy, then _the game is wrong_ and you
  shouldn't be playing it.  

The news this morning informs me Biden stumbled a bit.  Trump started strong, but
degenerated in to the usual shouty nonsense.  

Fine.  Whatever.  

The choice is still clear:  
- Biden, while old, is still sharp, still understand the operation of government, and
  still surrounds himself with competent people and has a humane agenda.  
- Trump, while old, is still an incomprehensible and incompetent sociopathic neo-Nazi who
  surrounds himself with what appear to be _competent_ sociopathic neo-Nazis.  
  
This is not a hard choice.  Vote for Biden.  Vote for Democrats up and down the ticket.  

When we have a Democratic presidency and Congress, we can start repairing the damage.  The
most severe damage is recent, but W did his share and a lot goes all the way back to
Reagan that we need to fix.  

That's the only way to get reasonable economic policy, lots of green energy, coastal
desalination plants, high speed rail, huge expansions of housing and mass transit,
unionization, gun control, voting rights, civil rights, progressive taxation to fund
Social Security and Medicare&hellip; and all the things that used to mean American
democracy.  

You want American democracy back?  Vote for Democrats, up and down the ticket.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The only bright spot (well, dim spot of light in the darkness?) is that Trump is due to be
sentenced in 2 weeks.  

Our adaptation of Cato the Elder is never more apt than now: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion), i.e., "I also think Trump must be incarcerated."

Nope.
