I feel I'm walking a knife-edge between hope and despair.  The news is not helping.  


## On the Knife-Edge

Among war in Ukraine, a continuing pandemic fraught with vaccine refusniks, and the
political pandemic of right-wing fascism, despair is a temptation. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
Although we've tried here, in this crummy little blog that nobody reads (CLBTNR), to find 
[reassons for hope]({{ site.baseurl }}/pessimism-and-optimism/#the-good-news-6-reasons-to-hope),
experience underscores that this is 
[a difficult enterprise requiring persistent efforts]({{ site.baseurl }}/spirit-of-complicated-people/).


And so it is today.  


## The Continuing Necessity of Vaccination  

We have vaccines.  They _work._  Boosters are available.  They _work even better._

Why do we continue to doubt this?  I came across this report from the Arizona Department
of Health Services, documenting _dramatic_ reductions in infection, hospitalization, and
death comparing unvaccinated vs vaccinated &amp; boosted people.  The data comes directly
from Arizona state data reported in January 2022. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
Wouldn't you rather be in the latter group?  Especially since it's easy, free, and safe?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-25-tension-hope-despair-HKvsNZ.jpg" width="400" height="282" alt="Hong Kong vs New Zealand: Case rates &amp; death rates for differing boost rates" title="Hong Kong vs New Zealand: Case rates &amp; death rates for differing boost rates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Consider, for example, Hong Kong and New Zealand:  
- Both populations attempted heavy border controls and a COVID-Zero policy.  
- Both were heavily vaccinated, but _only New Zealand was also heavily boosted._  
- The case rates are indistinguishable; both fell before the onslaught of Omicron
  beginning in February.  
- However, the death rate zoomed in Hong Kong _but not in New Zealand._  

All else being equal, wouldn't you prefer to follow the policy that led to a lower death
rate?  What sort of monster would prefer a generally higher death rate _for any politcal
reason whatsoever?_  


## No, It's Not Over  

Look, I get it: we _all_ want this to be over.  

But what we want _does not matter._  Only the facts about the virus, our vaccination
levels, and our behavior matter.  Everything else is wishful thinking leading to
unnecessary deaths.  Don't wish for needless deaths, ok?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-25-tension-hope-despair-medscape-1.jpg" width="400" height="210" alt="Ellis @ Medscape: US wastewater hints at new COVID wave" title="Ellis @ Medscape: US wastewater hints at new COVID wave" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-25-tension-hope-despair-nyt-1.jpg" width="400" height="624" alt="Mueller @ NYT: Ready for another COVID surge?" title="Mueller @ NYT: Ready for another COVID surge?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Consider the use of wastewater metagenomics, i.e., sequencing for viral RNA in sewage,
which we've used a couple times even here in this CLBTNR ([here]({{ site.baseurl }}/sars-cov2-cryptic/),
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/wastewater-reredux/), [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/wastewater-redux/),
and [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/wastewater-corona-virus-rna-vs-medical-loads/)).  We are _far_
from the only ones to realize that's likely useful; last week came an article in
_Medscape_ foretelling another wave based on wastewater virus levels <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>:  
- 37% of wastewater sites monitored by the CDC from 2022-Feb-24 to 2022-Mar-10 have seen a
  100% or more increase in viral RNA.  
- 30% of them saw increases of 1000% or more.  
- Our analysis said there was [a 7 day lag in hospitalizations and a 19 day lag in deaths]({{ site.baseurl }}/wastewater-reredux/#wave-summary)
  based on wastewater in the Omicron wave, so that's coming up soon.  

Buckle up.  

The _New York Times_ points out something similar, emphasizing our refusal to prepare in
spite of the warning data. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  We've all been relaxing
COVID-19 safety measures, lulling the public into a (likely false) sense that it's over.  

Most importantly, Republicans have _cut_ funding for the federal government to purchase
antivirals like paxlovid or monoclonal antiboy infusions.  We've gutted our ability to
test, and we were never much on reporting test results anyway.  

> But the federal government is warning that pandemic funds are drying up. __Senate
> Republicans have said that they will not approve $15 billion in new coronavirus aid
> without offsetting it by cutting spending elsewhere.__ House Democrats have balked at a

So basically, we're flying blind into storm clouds, hoping for the best.  This is&hellip;
_inadvisable._  

We can even _see it coming_ in the waves of Omicron/BA.2 in Europe, let alone our own
wastewater numbers.  More precisely, we can _look_, but we refuse to _see_ an oncoming
wave that's 30% - 50% more infectious than Omicron, which was a monster in itself.  

The wave should hit sometime between April and early summer.  

For now, we have hospital capacity in most places.  Ask again in April to summer, and
we'll see how _that_ lasts.  

Fortunately, it looks like the evidence for a 4th mRNA vaccine dose (2nd booster) points
toward pretty good efficacy (_q.v._, to be blogged here soonish, where nobody will read
about it).  If a second booster is authorized, you can bet that here at Chez Weekend we'll
be fighting to be at the head of the line.  


## The Malign Influence of Conservative Local Governments  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-25-tension-hope-despair-jama-1.jpg" width="400" height="255" alt="Woolf @ JAMA: Malign influence of local governments on public health in US" title="Woolf @ JAMA: Malign influence of local governments on public health in US" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Since the exit of [The Former Guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump) and the
blessed loss of Republican control of Congress, the Biden administration and the Congress
have at least tried to do the right thing.  But with a razor-thin Senate margin, Manchin
&amp; Sinema have been able to gum up the works for silly reasons of their own.  

This has left lots of freedom for local governments to operate, with deeply unfortunate
consequences for public health as documented last week in _JAMA._ <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  

The US has had lower life expectancy and higher disease rates than other nations for
_decades_, despite conservative delusions that we have the best of everything.  Now it's
not only getting worse on average, but it's getting _much_ worse in the red conservative
states.  The trend toward shorter, more brutal lives in the red states is statistically
significant and _not_ explained by racial differences because it holds within racial
groups between different states as well.  

It _is_ explained by refusal to expand Medicaid under Obamacare, refusal to tolerate any
form of gun control, refusal to implement even basic workplace safety, refusal to even
obey environmental law, and so on.  They won't even do basic nutritional labelling on
food.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-25-tension-hope-despair-jama-2.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-25-tension-hope-despair-jama-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="183" alt="Usher @ JAMA: Weekly excess per capita death rates in US: 3 red states vs 3 blue states" title="Usher @ JAMA: Weekly excess per capita death rates in US: 3 red states vs 3 blue states" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
COVID-19 has made this even more blatantly obvious.  Consider the figure from _JAMA_ shown
here, exhibiting the weekly excess per capita death rates in 3 red states (Florida,
Georgia, and Texas) vs 3 blue states (California, New Jersey, and New York).  It is
_blatantly obvious_ that it is simply less safe to live in the red states.  The article
goes on to point out controls showing this is not due to racial or demographic factors,
but due to bad policy factors in the red states.  

Florida had _triple_ the excess deaths vs New York, even though both states have similar
populations.  Why is triple the death rate even vaguely acceptable?  Why is DeSantis not
impeached over this?  If you want to know why we blue staters keep calling the Republicans
a "death cult", remember this evidence.  

Of course, with Republicans speaking lovingly of Putin and Russia, it's fitting to mention
that a _truly_ efficient right-wing police force looks something like this:  
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

(The first woman held up a sign which said in Russian: "two words".  Nothing more.
Apparently that's current Russian street slang for "no war", and it got her arrested
_that fast._)  

These days, that's what Republicans look like to the rest of us.  


## Some Few Reasons to Hope  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-03-25-tension-hope-despair-lancet-1.jpg" width="400" height="158" alt="Usher @ Lancet: 100-day vaccine 'moonshot'" title="Usher @ Lancet: 100-day vaccine 'moonshot'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
In the _The Lancet_ comes a report about the _Center for Epidemic Preparedness_ and its
effort to bring vaccine development times down to _100 days!_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  

Think about that: it used to be it took a _decade_; then with the mRNA vaccines we went
from knowledge of the viral sequence to a vaccine candidate 2 weeks later and a successful
clinical trial 6 months later!  Going from 10 years to 0.5 years is a 20-fold improvement,
and we should all be grateful that this capacity was unleashed at _precisely_ the correct
moment to save much of humanity in the COVID-19 pandemic.  

However, we've been struggling a bit with getting variant vaccines as fast as the virus
can mutate.  If we'd had 100-day vaccine capability, vaccines would have been available in
2020-April, rather than late 2020 or early 2021.  Think of the difference that could have
made!  

CEPI has raised \$1.5 billion (yes, with a "b") for this effort.  This is worthy of
applause.  

Or problems are largely not technical or medical.  They are problems of equity (supply
chains, availability for the poor, availability world-wide, eliminating strutural racism
that blocks access, &hellip;) and combating disinformation that leads to vaccine hesitancy
and superstitious defiance.   I'd really like to see some work on where all the vaccine
disinformation came from. (Is it grass-roots, or deliberately inflicted by a few bad
actors?  Anything we can do about them, now or in the future?)

Finally, let's marinate in a few words of encouragement from the (Internet-)famous
VlogBrothers, Hank Green and John Green.  Yes, they're "internet influencers", but I think
I've largely overcome my aversion to that and forgiven them for it because they are
relentlessly focused on making sense while making the world better ("reducing world suck",
in their terms).  

Hank Green on "When You Can't Fix Everything&hellip;":  
- "There aren't really any problems that aren't connected to the other problems."  So when
  you work on one problem, you're indirectly working on them all.  
- Focus on "making the world better... not perfect, but better!"  

Hank Green "Is it all hopeless?":  
- There's a lot of existential despair in the world, for understandable reasons.  
- "This is a hard moment.  And obviously different scales of bad for different people."  

John Green "Motivation in Hard Times":  
- "When times suck, it is hard to know when they will ever change"  
- Resentment, anger, and fear motivate you, but you don't end up feeling any better.  "It
  burns bright, but it _does_ burn dirty."  
- Speaking of his love for writing itself, for his readers, and for his publishers: "Love
  is the fuel that burns both bright and clean."  
- "Love is&hellip; also forged in surviving and turning around the bad times, together."  
- "It is winter, my friends.  And it has been winter for a long time.  It may be winter
  for a while longer.  But spring is coming."  I've never seen _Game of Thrones_, but this
  seems a brilliant turn of the tables on "Winter is coming."  
- His traditional farewell "Hank, I'll see you on Friday" was near tearful, as was I.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Let's finish with a few more theological thoughts from [the quotes page]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/)
of this CLBTNB.  

The first is a brilliant _misquote_ of the Talmud, somewhat mangling the sources but with
such a brilliant result I cannot but think the authors would agree:  

> "Do not be daunted by the enormity of the world’s grief. Do justly, now. Love mercy,
> now. Walk humbly, now. You are not obligated to complete the work, but neither are you
> free to abandon it."  
>  
> &mdash; Rabbi Tarfon, 
> [Pirkei Avot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirkei_Avot) 
> [2:16](https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en), 
> [Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud) (This popularized version rather mangles
> the original; it appears to be 
> [from a mix of sources](https://merrimackvalleyhavurah.wordpress.com/2018/06/23/fake-news-fake-quotes/)
> including the book of Micah 6:8, the Pirkei Avot 2:16, and 
> [a modern day translation by Rami Shapiro of Pirke Avot](https://smile.amazon.com/Wisdom-Jewish-Sages-Modern-Reading/dp/0517799669/).)  

Yeah, maybe we _can't_ fix everything.  But maybe we can fix just the one thing that's in
front of each of us, now.  

And while we can't perhaps see the end of our work, and we can't quite make sense of it
right now, and we can't do it without each other&hellip; we can still make progress.  This
sentiment was expressed by the theologian Reihhold Nieburh, who first made words like
"faith", "hope", and "charity" make sense to me:  

> "Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime;  
> therefore, we are saved by hope.  
>  
> Nothing true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history;  
> therefore, we are saved by faith.  
>  
> Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone;  
> therefore, we are saved by love."  
>  
> &mdash; [Reinhold Niebuhr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhold_Niebuhr)  

We got work to do.
