[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about the style of argument
used when discussing the Talmud, a centuries-long rabbinical dialog on Jewish Law.  The
style involves not so much _winning_ (though there is that), but mostly about
_understanding_ multiple points of view.  Sound like something the world could use about
now?  

It's an unusual question, since neither my friend nor I are Jews.  I am, though, religious with as
much affection for Judaism as an outsider can reasonably have&hellip; so maybe not _completely_
unusual.  


## On having deeper conversations  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-11-29-we-need-talmudic-arguments-brooks.jpg" width="400" height="239" alt="Brooks: Deeper Conversations" title="Brooks: Deeper Conversations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
My friend was reacting to a _New York Times_ piece by
[David Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brooks_(commentator)) <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
on having "deeper conversations", particularly this bit:
> __Find the disagreement under the disagreement.__ In the Talmudic tradition when two people disagree about something, it's because there is some deeper philosophical or moral disagreement undergirding it. Conversation then becomes a shared process of trying to dig down to the underlying disagreement and then the underlying disagreement below that. There is no end. Conflict creates cooperative effort. As neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett writes <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2), "Being curious about your friend's experience is more important than being right."  

Now, normally I don't have time for guys like Brooks.  I am made ill by the delusions of
conservative pundits.  I am enraged by the ones that call themselves "centrists", with
their banal evil and false  neutrality of both-siderism <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> to 
avoid naming and shaming the right-wing shenanigans.  

But this time&hellip; I gotta admit, this is a bit of all right.  My friend described his
reaction thusly:
> I found this paragraph fascinating in ways I am still carefully unwrapping, as I would delicately unfold tissue paper holding an object of great value that belongs to history and not to me&hellip;  

How might it have come to pass that Jews have learned the art of learned argument from a
viewpoint of mutual respect, and how might their example teach the rest of us?  


## Architecture of a Talmud page  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-11-29-we-need-talmudic-arguments-kremer.jpg" width="400" height="278" alt="Kremer: Why is the Talmud popular?" title="Kremer: Why is the Talmud popular?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
The Talmud appears, to this non-Jew, to be something of an artifact _engineered_ to do
exactly this.  Unlike the Torah, with its magisterial pronouncements, the Talmud is a
series of arguments in conversation with each other over the centuries &ndash; mixed
with no small amount of stories and jokes.  An excellent _BBC News_ article by William 
Kremer <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4) illustrates this with the anatomy of a typical page:

![Talmud page architecture]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-11-29-we-need-talmudic-arguments-talmud-page.jpg "Talmud page architecture")

- First, of course, is the law: the Torah, or Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament as Christians
  like to call it.  This is preserved in several forms, whether via the 
  [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint), or the
  [Masoretic text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretic_Text), or other sources.  
- The [Talmud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud) is an attempt to preserve the oral
  tradition (what the Law _means_ in terms of daily living) during the Roman occupation of
  Judea, starting around the second century with
  [Judah ha-Nasi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ha-Nasi) and successors.  This is
  roughly the Mishnah, in the center of the page (colored pink in the illustration).  
- The next part is the Gemara, indicated in yellow in the illustration just below the
  Mishnah.  It's a series of discussions, amplifications, and arguments about the Mishnah,
  the Torah, and other sources.  It has thesis statements, questions, responses,
  discussions, &hellip; which rarely finally settle anything.  
- Next, in blue in the illustration wrapped around the Mishnah &amp; Gemara to the upper
  right, is the commentary of [Rashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi), an 11th
  century French rabbi.  It's rendered in a special font (Rashi text).  You know you're
  beginning to be A Bit of a Big Deal when you get your own commentary area on each page
  of the Talmud, and people invent a font just for you.  
- Finally, wrapped around everything else on the left, bottom, and right is commentary and
  glosses from everybody else (show green in the illustration).  These are mostly 10th
  century rabbis, but there can also be modern interpretations especially about language.
  There are a lot of cross-references to other passages with similar topics or similar
  language, or where legal rulings in medieval Jewish law are relevant.  
  
Kremer consults Gila Fine, editor-in-chief of Maggid Books in Jerusalem on her experience
as a woman studying Talmud (usually restricted to men among the more Orthodox):  

> Unlike the lofty, magisterial prose of the Torah, she found the Talmud to have "all the imperfections, the trivialities, the multiplicity of voices, the wild associations - everything that characterises human conversation."  
>  
>But Fine eventually fell in love with the book and is now overseeing the publication of a new edition. She relates in particular to the Aggadah, the folkloric stories in the Talmud, which rub shoulders with the dense, legalistic Halakha text, and seem sometimes to subvert it.  
>  
>"You have stories of women who criticise men, of non-Jews who put Jews to shame, of poor simple folk who make a mockery out of rabbis - there's something very liberated and liberating about Aggadah," she says.  


## On arguments to sharpen our (mutual) understanding  

So the Talmud encourges argument because it _is_ an argument in some ways: the very page
layout tells you this.  It is conducted over millennia, via commentaries written by the
deepest scholars of the Law, with lots of stories and jokes along the way&hellip; and
you're invited to join.  Because it's a little more speculative, sometimes crazy, it
invites discussion in a way that the majesty of the Torah does not.  

It's a _respectful_ argument because the goal is not to dominate all the other viewpoints,
but to _understand_ all the other viewpoints in their full complexity and multiplicity.
None of the predecessor commentaries came to universal agreement, so why should you?  Your
partner is not _wrong_; you're just trying to _add_ another aspect to your mutual
understanding.  The world is, after all, not simple, so neither is our spiritual
understanding of it.  

(With all the cross-references, one might argue that it is an example of early attempts at
hypertext.  I've also heard this claim made about Thomas à Kempis's 15th century book, _De
Imitatione Christi_ <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>: each chapter is 1 page on 1 topic,
with cross-references to many other chapters.  In fact, my introduction to _De Imitatione
Christi_ was via [Hypercard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard) in the late 80s.)  


## On humor  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-11-29-we-need-talmudic-arguments-unsong.jpg" width="400" height="90" alt="UNSONG" title="UNSONG" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Ok, if we're going to mention the folklore and jokes in the Talmud, we have to talk about
Scott Alexander's novel, _Unsong_. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  It takes ideas from
the Talmud and asks, "What if the world was _literally_ like that?"  

As a science fiction novel, it's brilliant: 
- Uriel, the nerd sysadmin angel, trying to keep reality running  
- Silicon Valley full of "big theonomy" companies trying to copyright the Names of G-d from kaballah used for spells  
- Unitarian Universalist underground cells doing _samizdat_ kaballah  
- a battle in which the Lubavitcher Rebbe turns the Statue of Liberty into a golem and rides it into battle saving the day  
- loads of puns involving Torah stories and whales (example: "Baleen Shem Tov")  
- trying to explain knock-knock jokes to an angel  
- why [Elisha Ben Abuyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisha_ben_Abuyah) is always referred to as "the other one" in the Talumd  

&hellip; and a _lot_ of even crazier stuff.  (Uriel says: "PLEASE DO NOT BLOW UP MOUNTAINS.  IT NEVER
HELPS.")  

Scott's a psychiatrist, and said the free associations used in kaballah are very like the
free associations some of his stranger patients had.  Their world views not only made
sense to them, they made _perfect_ sense.  More sense than reality should make.  

Trust me: if you're interested in Jewish thinking, it's _utterly hilarious_.  Even if
you'e not, it's still pretty funny.  


## What does that say about American politics?  

Of course, to have a properly respectful dialog as in the Talmudic tradition, it takes
both sides being committed to that attitude.  You can't have Talmudic dialog with a
fanatic who denies your right to exist, or the fundamental legitimacy of your ideas.  That
would be like the Israelis attempting Talmudic dialog with Hezbollah, for example:
respectful dialog is the wrong response to someone who denies your right to exist.  I see
nothing but venom, rage, and contempt coming from the American Republican right at the
moment; respectful dialog is not even remotely the correct response to Trump.  

This is why I'm so frustrated with the mindless both-siderism of people like Brooks: his
article makes an excellent point, but one which is of no applicability when attempting to
talk to Republicans.  The time for respectful dialog will come, when there is mutual
respect.  Though probably not with this version of the Republican party.  

We should all live so long.  (No, really: we should.)
