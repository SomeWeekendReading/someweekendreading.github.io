Winter is the best time of the year.  Do not attempt to correct me on ths.  


## Winter Beauty  

Here at Ch&aacute;teau Weekend, we love winter.  

Well, more accurately: 1/3rd of us do.  The Weekend Editrix _despises_ winter, a position
with which I sympathize but do not understand.  The Weekend Publisher doesn't care much
for it, mostly because we take down his tent on the deck and he has to confine his outdoor
stalking activities to a little canvas hunting blind (a.k.a. "pet playpen").

Dear as those two are to your humble Weekend Editor, they are mistaken.  New evidence of the
aesthetic error of insufficient affection for winter comes from an _Associated Press_ article a mad
architect in Finland, where they do winter _professionally._ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>

The mad architect in question, Pasi Widgren, took to the shores of Lake Pitkajarvi north
of Helsinki on 2021-Dec-04.  His instrument of artistic expression?  The noble snow
shovel.  (Though I suspect GPS was involved, as well.)  

The result is shown here in 3 photos from the AP (click to embiggen) of an arctic fox
which is 90m from side to side.  To get some idea of that scale, note in the second photo
there is a human walking on the ice in the upper left.  Basically: _big_, high-precision
snow shovel work here.  

The whole thing took, astonishingly, only about 4hr to complete.  After that, he climbed
to the top of some 45m cliffs to look at the result.  (I'm almost surprised there's that
much daylight in Finland this time of year.  He must have started in the early morning!)  

This is his 6th year of [_theia mania_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_madness) artwork.
He offered the explanation that he hopes it will:  

> &hellip;make people happy and encourage them to go out to hike in a beautiful nature.  

Make people happy.  Appreciate the beauty around them.  

Now, _that's_ a version of the [Divine Madness]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#TheDivineMadness).  

May we all aspire to the same.
