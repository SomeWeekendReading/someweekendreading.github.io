Winter is the best time of the year.  Do not attempt to correct me on this matter.  


## Winter Beauty  

Here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, we love winter.

Well, more accurately: 1/3rd of us love winter.  
- The Weekend Editrix _despises_ winter, a position with which I sympathize but do not
  understand.   _Comme d'habitude._  
- The Weekend Publisher doesn't care much for it either, mostly because we take down his
  summer tent on the deck.  He then has to confine his winter backyard stalking activities to
  a little canvas hunting blind (a.k.a. "pet playpen").  (Perhaps he will be happier when
  we build him a solarium on the deck?)

Dear as those two are to your humble Weekend Editor, they are both mistaken.  New evidence of the
aesthetic error of having insufficient affection for winter comes from an _Associated
Press_ article about a mad architect in Finland  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  (where
they do winter _professionally._)  

The mad architect in question, one Pasi Widgren, took to the shores of Lake Pitkajarvi north
of Helsinki on 2021-Dec-04.  His instrument of artistic expression?  The noble snow
shovel.  (The particular snow shovel in question is shown in the 3rd photo here.  Though I
suspect GPS was involved, as well.)  

The result is shown in 3 photos from the AP (click to embiggen) of an arctic fox
which is 90m tall.  To get some idea of that scale, note in the second photo
there is a human walking away on the ice in the upper left.  Basically: _big_, high-precision
snow shovel work here.  

The whole thing took, astonishingly, only about 4hr to complete.  After that, Widgren climbed
to the top of some 45m cliffs to look at the result.  (I'm _almost_ surprised there's that
much daylight in Finland this time of year.  He must have started in the early morning!)  

This is his 6th year of [_theia mania_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_madness)
artwork.  

In a way, it reminds me of
[Japanese rice paddy art](https://www.google.com/search?q=japanese+rice+paddy+art&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS504US504&source=lnms&tbm=isch),
a more summerish sport pursued by Japanese rice farmers who are intelligent but bored, and
in possession of multiple strains of rice, programmable planting machinery, and GPS.  I
love the fact that nobody would have predicted either form of ephemeral art.  Both of them
are beautiful&hellip; and hilarious.  

Wigdren offered the explanation that he hopes his art will:  

> &hellip;make people happy and encourage them to go out to hike in a beautiful nature.  

Make people happy.  Appreciate the beauty around them.  

Now, _that's_ a version of the [Divine Madness]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#TheDivineMadness).  

May we all aspire to the same?  Please?
