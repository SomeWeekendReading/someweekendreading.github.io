So, in the US today it's Father's Day.  


## Why do I have an opinion about Father's Day?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-18-fathers-day-2023-weekend-publisher-hammock.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-18-fathers-day-2023-weekend-publisher-hammock-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="The Weekend Publisher, stationed in his hammock to surveil the household" title="The Weekend Publisher, stationed in his hammock to surveil the household" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
I'm not, to the best of my knowledge, anyone's father.  And, given the biology involved,
I'm pretty sure about that knowledge.  Thing like that, I'm almost certain I would
remember.  

I mean, you could stretch a point and say that, as a male caregiver, I am the "father" of
the Weekend Publisher, shown here surveying the world from his lofty hammock.  But not
"father" in the way cats do it, because that's just crazy.  So I'm sort of were-human
cat-father? <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

No, today I just want to share with you the best Father's Day spirit I have thus far
observed:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/mcnees/status/1293947447954341901"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-18-fathers-day-2023-flashlight.jpg" width="550" height="271" alt="McNees @ Twitter: How to con your kid into reading by changing batteries" title="McNees @ Twitter: How to con your kid into reading by changing batteries" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

McNees is a physicist (of which we firmly approve) though he does quantum gravity (which
we can forgive).  He encourages his kid to keep reading rebelliously under the covers at
night, by surreptitiously changing the batteries in her flashlight.  

This is How It Is Done, I think.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  But I wish I'd had
this sort of experience as a kid growing up!  

Bravo.  

Contrary to the advice from everybody everywhere, I also read the comments.  Some are
pretty good, even years later:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/tomgauld/status/1660223035616514050"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-18-fathers-day-2023-dad-too.jpg" width="550" height="526" alt="Tom Gauld: Dad joins kid reading under the covers" title="Tom Gauld: Dad joins kid reading under the covers" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Yep, nothing like a little solidarity from the Parental Units to bolster a kid.  

<a href="https://twitter.com/rachelwmartin/status/1294128072673771520"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-06-18-fathers-day-2023-temptation.jpg" width="550" height="236" alt="Martin @ Twitter: Temptation to science!" title="Martin @ Twitter: Temptation to science!" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Yes, indeed: temptation works both ways.  The light side of The Force  underutilizes it.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Kids these days! You have long-lived LED flashlights.  

Back in my day, all we had D cells that were always dying, and crummy little bulbs that
were always burning out.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
