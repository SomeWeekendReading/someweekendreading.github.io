Two NYPD transit cops forcibly ejected a citizen from a Manhattan subway station.  His
crime?  Pointing out that the cops were not wearing masks, in contravention of a statewide
mask mandate, and, for that matter simple common sense and courtesy.  


## NYPD transit cops did _what_, now?

The story from _BoingBoing_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, confirmed by the
_New York Daily News_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, is that Andy Gilbert saw 2 cops on
a subway platform not wearing masks.  As of 2020-Sep, there's a \$50 fine for not wearing
a mask on the subay, so it's reasonable to ask the cops what they're doing.  

Apparently one officer mockingly said he couldn't hear Gilbert through his mask.  The
badge ids identified the officers as Joseph Vincent and Grace Rosero Tapia.  Then Vincent
declared that Gilbert was 'disruptive', and the two of them angrily shoved Gilbert out the
emergency gate, as captured by video from another passenger shown in the NYDN article.  

Gilbert said:  

> I’ve had police threaten me a few times for asking them why they’re parked in bike
> lanes, but I’ve never had any cop physically assault me.  Cops don’t care about the
> law.  They just do whatever they want and there’s no accountability.  

That's pretty much the definition of _bad cop._  

Fortunately, there are people taking video of police actions, which is a citizen right
supported by the
[Supreme Court decision Glik v Cunniffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glik_v._Cunniffe).
Indeed, there's a whole Twitter account devoted to this:
[@Copwatch\_CPU, whose slogan is "Exposing Dirty Cops in NYC"](https://twitter.com/Copwatch_CPU).
The @Copwatch\_CPU folks published video taken by a commuter documenting the affair from
another viewpoint:

Reaction was swift, and universally negative.  For example,
Prof PZ Myers <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> pointed out that cops are always asking for
more equipment, viewing themselves as an occupying army against citizens.  It's
unsurprising that citizens resist this.  

Of course we understand that cops feel threatened.  They are just _massively confused_
about what the real threat is: while their unions are busy resisting mask mandates, the
main cause of police deaths is COVID-19.  More than gunshot, more than anything.
Resisting vaccination and resisting masks is just _stupid_.  Resisting even talking to a
citizen who asks them about masks is _vicious and stupid_.  

Yes, "not all cops".  But the good ones need to reign in the rest.  If they don't, they're
complicit.

NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea described this as "absolutely inexcusable", and Mayor de
Blasio said it was completely "unacceptable" <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>:  

> We’ve given this instruction a thousand times — if you’re going to be in law
> enforcement, you actually have to participate in following the law.  

Unfortunately, the 'discipline' imposed could cost officers Vincent and Tapia 'up to' 10
vacation days.  What do you want to bet that 'up to' means 'actually 0'?  I can't see a
police department in the US with their paramilitary culture taking this seriously.  

What I would _like_ to see is these 2 jokers fired and banned from police or military work
for life.  I will, of course, not get what I want here.


## Cops understandably feel threatened, but are confused about the _actual_ threat  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-22-cops-vs-masks-vs-us-cnn.jpg" width="400" height="78" alt="CNN: Cops risk of COVID death is 5 times that of gunshot" title="CNN: Cops risk of COVID death is 5 times that of gunshot" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

Meanwhile, CNN reports almost simultaneously <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> that the
risk to cops from COVID-19 is _slightly more than 5 times the risk from guns._  The
numbers:  

$$
\begin{align*}
\mbox{COVID-19 to guns risk ratio} &= \frac{476 \mbox{ COVID-19 deaths}}{94\mbox{ gun deaths}} \\
                                   &= 5.064\mbox{ COVID-19 deaths/gun death}
\end{align*}
$$

So: if you're a cop, you're entitled to worry about your safety, but why then does your
union resist vaccination mandates and masking against COVID-19 when
_that's clearly the thing that is most likely to kill you?!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-22-cops-vs-masks-vs-us-reuters.jpg" width="400" height="205" alt="Reuters: Cops not vaxed by Nov 30 put on unpaid leave" title="Reuters: Cops not vaxed by Nov 30 put on unpaid leave" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">

How can we do better?  

Look no further than our wonderful neighbor to the north, Canada.  Reuters reports that
Toronto police who are unvaccinated by November 30 will be placed on unpaid 
leave. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  _That's_ how civilized peoples behave.  

A fantasy thought: could we subcontract our policing to Canada?  I mean, yeah, probably not&hellip;
but let me dream for a moment here, ok?  


## A less realistic response  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pa6BlJlrL-k" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
There are, of course, alternatives for dealing with people who won't wear masks, won't get
vaccinated, and generally won't behave like anything other than selfish barbarians.  For
example, from the _YouTube_ channel "Sufficiently Advanced" (Clarke's 3rd law, anyone?)
comes a gun that shoots masks onto people's faces.  <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  

In their words:  
> I made a mask launcher and brought it to Huntington Beach, which is one of the most
> anti-mask cities in southern California. What could possibly go wrong?  

Well, quite a few things, maybe?  

I mean&hellip; sure, it's brilliant and hilarious.  Also probably felony assault to use it on an
unwilling subject.  And, given the hyper-military, hair-trigger police you're likely to
encounter (good cops aside, of course), attempting to use it on a cop is likely to get you
_shot dead_.  

Another wonderful fantasy.  That's 3 fantasies in this post: firing NYPD cops who won't mask
and react violently to being questioned, outsourcing policing to Canada, and now a mask
gun.  It's fantasy day here at Chez Weekend, apparently.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d-7o9xYp7eE" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>

My maxim for dealing with police in the last few years has been to avoid them whenever
possible.  Yes, there are good cops.  I know some of them.  Some of them are even in my
family.  But for a random cop, I can't tell the good ones from the bad ones, and the cost
of interacting with a bad one is life-threatening.  So&hellip; consider seriously the
advice of law Prof. James Duane from some years ago: don't talk to
cops.  <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  Pretty much no good can come from it.  Cooperate
where you _must_, but no more.  

Maybe American policing will change for the better.  I hope so.  But in the meantime,
avoid them like you'd avoid soldiers of an occupying army, because that's how many of them
think of themselves.
