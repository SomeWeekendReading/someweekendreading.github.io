I am slowly learning _never_ to ask how low Republicans can go in the US.  


## Well, how low CAN they go?  

Think [Mariana Trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench) (10.9 km).  Think
[Kola Superdeep Borehole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole) (12.26 km).
Think [Al Shaheen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Shaheen_Oil_Field#Records) (12.28 km).  Think 
[Dante's _Inferno_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)) (and don't forget the stink).  

Then drill deeper.  _Much_ deeper.  


## Sigh&hellip; what's the background here, again?  

We've [previously written](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/authoritarian-cops/#background-on-authoritarianism)
on some of the background of paranoid authoritarianism in American politics and its deep
historical roots.  This is not some contemporary quirk; they've pretty much _always_ been
this way.  It's just more obvious now, since they feel empowered to speak
straightforwardly.

And that's not just my opinion.  (Though it also _is_ my opinion, not that you have any
reason to care about that.)  The 4 books shown here, in this order, are well-respected
academics and authors giving us the essential foundation to understanding the American
political dilemma. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
<sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  They also explain some
of the world politics, at least in Europe where we share some cultural background features.  

We know some constants.  The features, as we previously wrote, from Adorno and Altemeyer's
books are something like:  

> - __Conventionalism:__ Adherence to conventional values.  
> - __Authoritarian Submission:__ Towards ingroup authority figures.  
> - __Authoritarian Aggression:__ Against people who violate conventional values.  
> - __Anti-Intraception:__ Opposition to subjectivity and imagination.  
> - __Superstition and Stereotypy:__ Belief in individual fate; thinking in rigid categories.  
> - __Power and Toughness:__ Concerned with submission and domination; assertion of strength.  
> - __Destructiveness and Cynicism:__ hostility against human nature.  
> - __Projectivity:__ Perception of the world as dangerous; tendency to project unconscious impulses.  
> - __Sex:__ Overly concerned with modern sexual practices.  

We see this arise in multiple ways:  
- a desperate, hateful, and racist "othering" of some scapegoat group (Feemasons, Jews,
  Blacks, Hispanics, women, immigrants),  
- fetishization of political symbols of tribal loyalty (flags, statues, buildings,
  memorials, weapons),  
- over-reliance on concrete slogans instead of reason,  
- worship of power figures like Trump,  
- extreme concern over anything remotely sexual (abortion, contraception, reproductive
  healthcare in general),  
- understanding the world _only_ in terms of power (hence Republicans think Democrats are
  _inherently_ ineligible for power, so any election saying otherwise must be overturned),  
- extreme reliance on over-simplified superstition and religion,  

&hellip; and so on.  


## Ok, the latest bleats from the right-wing sheep are&hellip;  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-19-gop-demonic-rushmore-park.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="Mount Rushmore" title="Mount Rushmore" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The particular patriotic fetish of concern today is
[Mt Rushmore](https://www.nps.gov/moru/index.htm), the place in the Black Hills of South
Dakota with the sculptures of the heads of presidents Washington, Jefferson, T Roosevelt,
and Lincoln.  

No question that these are interesting American political figures, each worthy of note for
various reasons (good and ill).  Also, no question that the site itself has a long and
somewhat tortured history, especially
[the land dispute with the Lakota Sioux tribe of Native Americans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore#Land_dispute),
who by treaty are supposed to control this land.  Let us summarize by simply noting that
American ability to honor treaties with Native Americans is, at best, indifferent.

That, of course, is not what concerns our Nimrod of the day.  He's busy with much bigger,
more bizarre issues.  An article from _The Hill_ <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> is about
as close as I want to get to the original source.

At least, I'm not getting closer without serious, rad-hard brain protection, a collection
of 10-foot Poles of Poking Things, and
[Gerry Anderson's International Rescue](https://www.gerryanderson.com/international-rescue-origins/)
on speed-dial. Since that version of "International Rescue" is fictional, it just ain't
gonna happen. (Hey: the righties get their paranoid fantasies, so let me have my excitingly humane
fantasy.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-19-gop-demonic-rushmore-donell.jpg" width="100" height="130" alt="Joe Donnell, SD Repub Rep: Rushmore is Freemason shrine and demonic portal of communism" title="Joe Donnell, SD Repub Rep: Rushmore is Freemason shrine and demonic portal of communism" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
What makes me so squeamish?  Buckle up, Buttercup.  

One
[Joe Donnell of the South Dakota legislature](https://sdlegislature.gov/Legislators/Profile/4442/Detail),
shown here, opined that:  
- Mt Rushmore is a "Freemason shrine",  
- and as such it is a "portal for demonic entities to enter and spread communism
  throughout the country."  
  
"Well!"
([As we have previously noted Jack Benny made bank by saying.](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/moderna-vaccine-passes-vrbpac-review/#fn2))
Didn't see that coming, now, did we?  Every time you think you've plumbed the depths of
conservative "thought"&hellip; you fall through a trap-door into something lower.  

Let's just pull the condom over our brains and have a look at the man's own words:  

> What the __Lord has revealed to me__ is that Mount Rushmore has a direct __ley line__ to
> Washington, D.C.  
> &hellip;  
> In order to understand the spiritual realm of what we’re facing, we have to realize that
> in order for __the enemy__ to do anything, it needs the agreement of human beings. In order
> to be empowered to do more damage he needs the agreement of human beings and oftentimes
> that comes in the form of __an altar that acts as a portal for other demonic things.__ What
> we’re really dealing with in that __portal is communism.__ That __witchcraft,__ altar, those
> things that are happening in the Black Hills, what we’re dealing with is communism. It’s
> the ideology and all the demonic entities and spirits behind that.  

It is unclear what he thinks are the connections between Freemasons, portals, demons,
communism, and witchcraft.  I'm pretty sure I don't want to hear any further
'clarification', if I can avoid it.  

But just _look_ at all the boxes he ticks in just a few words:
- Fetishization of a patriotic symbol (Mt Rushmore).  
- Extreme, but highly suspect religiousity ("altar" imagery and personal revelations from
  G-d, not just for himself, but which he wishes to impose upon others).   
- Invocation of weird superstitious thinking ([Ley lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ley_line),
  and magical "portals").  
- Deep fear imagery ("the enemy" is Hebrew Bible code for the devil, as well as invocation
  of concepts like "demon" and "witch").  
- Of course nothing would be complete without the usual conservative bugaboos: Freemasons
  and communists must be behind it all, somehow.  

Reportedly, Donnell is apparently a member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate tribe, which
makes his Christian fundamentalism and superstition an interesting twist.  

I dunno what he _thinks_ is happening in the Black Hills, but&hellip; I'm pretty sure it
ain't _that._  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Ladies and gentlemen, your modern Republican party.  

If you're somehow still a Republican and reasonably sane, remember that _this is how you
look to the entire rest of the world._ Get out now, with as much of your sanity still
intact as you can manage.  I promise it doesn't hurt.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-19-gop-demonic-rushmore-weekend-publisher-barfy.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="The Weekend Publisher, hanging over the table edge, looking barfy" title="The Weekend Publisher, hanging over the table edge, looking barfy" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I just couldn't stand the idea of leaving the taste of that kind of powerful idiot in our
minds.  So I consulted the Weekend Publisher, a.k.a. "my cat", about what to do.  He
didn't say much (not even
[in French, as he sometimes does]({{ site.baseurl }}/misbranding-chatgpt-french/)).  He
just leaned over the edge of the table and looked kind of barfy.  

Barfy: that does sort of sum up the situation, doesn't it?  

Now, I have to admit: he's not the brightest cat.  But even with a brain the size of a
walnut, he knows better than to have anything to do with Republicans.  

If you won't listen to me, at least listen to the cat.  

He knows what's barfy and what's not.
