[Texas passed an abortion ban at 6 weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/05/us/anti-abortion-movement-texas-law.html), 
in defiance of Federal rulings that they cannot do this before 
[fetal viability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability) (about 25weeks).  How did
that happen?   


## Well&hellip; it _is_ Texas, after all  

Here in much of the US when people say we're crazy, we point at the American South.  In the South
when people tell them they're crazy, they point at Texas.  (And occasionally Florida.)  

Periodically the red states pass abortion bans in defiance of the Constitution and federal
law, which the Supreme Court then strikes down.  It's a sort of political theatre.  

What's different here is that the Texas law does not require state officials to enforce
it.  Instead, it allows private citizens to sue anybody who provides an abortion beyond 6
weeks (before most women know they're pregnant), or anyone who helps (nurses,
receptionists, ride-share drivers, &hellip;).  There are even bounties offered for tips
leading to successful prosecutions.  This apparently monkey-wrenches federal review, since
there is no visible state official to sue.  The Supreme Court refused to review it on
those grounds, saying it had to be enforced and the victim had to appeal/sue before they could
do anything.  (And given the extreme conservative bias of the current Court, the result
there would be doubtful anyway.)  

It looks to me like an invitation to vigilantes, or even the "informer" culture of the
East German Stasi.  But then, I'm just some liberal with firm opinions and a blog.  What
do actual historians think?  

Consider [Joshua Zeitz](http://www.joshuamzeitz.com/info): PhD from Brown, former
professor at Harvard, Princeton, and University of Cambridge; contributing editor at
_Politico_ and the _New York Times_.  Not exactly the "firm opinions + blog" type; more
like somebody to whom it's worth listening.  He had this to say:  

!["Joshua Zeitz: Texas law and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850"]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-08-vigilante-madness.jpg "Joshua Zeitz: Texas law and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850")

Required legal action on the say-so of a single random person, perverse financial
incentives like bounties, turning people into objects to manipulate, compulsory
participation in state brutality, a violent history&hellip; it sure ticks all the boxes
doesn't it?  

One consequence: [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/), a prominent quantum
complexity theorist formerly of MIT and now of UT Austin, said that it's difficult now to
recruit _anybody_ to come join the faculty at UT Austin, especially women.  He 
compared it to trying to recruit for Kabul University in 
Afghanistan. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

The [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850)
is described in _Wikipedia_ as "arguably the most hated and openly violated piece of
federal legislation in the nation's history".  

And so it seems to be here.  

## Addendeum: A legal strategy  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-09-08-vigilante-madness-tribe-rosenberg.jpg" width="400" height="185" alt="Tribe &amp; Rosenberg: Using anti-KKK law to fight Texas abortion vigilantes" title = "Tribe &amp; Rosenberg: Using anti-KKK law to fight Texas abortion vigilantes" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Today in the venerable _Globe_ came an article by even more venerable law professors
Laurence Tribe and David Rosenberg. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
- The Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 was formulated to prevent vigilante mobs in the South from
  torturing and murdering formerly enslaved Americans.  It outlawed the delegation of
  government power to mobs of random citizens.  Congress enacted this to provide a federal
  judicial remedy for violation of Constitutional rights when the state remedies had been
  crippled.  
- In 1984, the restaurant Grendel's Den wanted a liquor license from the city of Cambridge
  Massachusetts.  There was an obscure law in Mass in those days giving churches veto
  power over liquor licenses within 500 feet, and a church attempted to do so in this
  case.  The lawsuit went to the Supreme Court, since unaccountable private entities
  should not be able to restrict the rights of others for sectarian, partisan,
  ideological, or other reasons that would be illegal if government used them.  Tribe &
  Rosenberg won the case 8-1, using the KKK Act of 1871 to strike down the exercise of
  government power by non-government entities.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> Grendel's
  Den is still in business today (been there; pretty good (ok, not _recently_, during the
  pandemic&hellip;)).  
- In the Texas abortion vigilante case, it's even more extreme.  Instead of just
  abrogating zoning rights, they are abrogating _Constitutionally guaranteed_ rights.
  - None of the bounties or fines go toward damages incurred by the vigilantes, so they
    are all punitive.  The Supreme Court has struck down punitive damages that are too far
    in excess of actual damages. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  
  - Also, the vigilantes submitting abortion cases are vulnerable to being sued
    themselves, _personally_.  If they are acting under color of law, they are subject to
    being sued for unjusty enforcing it. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  Perhaps the
    possibility of Federal criminal prosecution will discourage vigilantes?  

Their conclusion:  

> Whatever force one attributes to Supreme Court precedent, it must be followed unless and
> until expressly overruled. To turn a blind eye to the blatant departure from its own
> precedent, as the Whole Woman’s Health decision did, is for the court to deny its own
> legitimacy and invite chaos to replace the rule of law. Neither the Justice Department
> nor private litigants can ignore the illegality of granting bounties willy-nilly to
> private individuals for their own benefit, an unconstitutional money-making scheme if
> ever there was one.  

Yes.  More of that, please.  Attorney General Garland, are you listening?
