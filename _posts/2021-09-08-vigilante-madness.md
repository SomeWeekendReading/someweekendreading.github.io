[Texas passed an abortion ban at 6 weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/05/us/anti-abortion-movement-texas-law.html), 
in defiance of Federal rulings that they cannot do this before 
[fetal viability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability) (about 25weeks).  How did
that happen?   


## Well&hellip; Texas  

Here in much of the US when people say we're crazy, we point at the American South.  In the South
when people tell them they're crazy, they point at Texas.  (And occasionally Florida.)  

Periodically the red states pass defiant abortion bans, which the Supreme Court then
strikes down.  It's a sort of political theatre.  

What's different here is that the Texas law does not require state officials to enforce
it.  Instead, it allows private citizens to sue anybody who provides an abortion beyond 6
weeks (before most women know they're pregnant), or anyone who helps (nurses,
receptionists, ride-share drivers, &hellip;).  There are even bounties offered for tips
leading to successful prosecutions.  This apparently monkey-wrenches federal review, since
there is no visible state official to sue.  The Supreme Court refused to review it on
those grounds, saying it had to be enforeced and the victim had to appeal/sue before they could
do anything.  (And given the extreme conservative bias of the current Court, the result
there would be doubtful anyway.)  

It looks to me like an invitation to vigilantes, or even the "informer" culture of the
East German Stasi.  But then, I'm just some liberal with firm opinions and a blog.  What
do actual historians think?  

Consider [Joshua Zeitz](http://www.joshuamzeitz.com/info): PhD from Brown, former
professor at Harvard, Princeton, and University of Cambridge; contributing editor at
_Politico_ and the _New York Times_.  Not exactly the "firm opinions + blog" type; more
like somebody to whom it's worth listening.  He had this to say:

Required legal action on the say-so of a single random person, perverse financial
incentives like bounties, turning people into objects of manipulation, compulsory state
brutality, a violent history&hellip; it sure ticks all the boxes doesn't it?  

One consequence: [Scott Aaronson](https://www.scottaaronson.com/), a prominent quantum
complexity theorist formerly of MIT and now of UT Austin, said that it's difficult now to
recruit _anybody_ to come join the faculty at UT Austin, especially women.  He 
[compared it to trying to recruit for Kabul University in Afghanistan](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=5807). <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

The [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850)
is described in _Wikipedia_ as "arguably the most hated and openly violated piece of
federal legislation in the nation's history".  

And so it seems to be here.
