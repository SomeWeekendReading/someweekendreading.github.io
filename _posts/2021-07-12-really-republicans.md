[_Warning:_ US-centric, lefty political rant.  If you're from outside the US and want to
laugh at us&hellip; well, fair enough: we've earned it.] I mean&hellip; _really_, Republicans?
Do you seriously want to put up with politicians like this?  For what _possible_
reason?  Why would you even want to be in the same party as people like this?  


## The 3 Stooges  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-12-really-republicans-3-stooges.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="The Three Stooges: they just PRETENDED to be that stupid" title="The Three Stooges: they just PRETENDED to be that stupid" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Back in my childhood, there used to be a comedy series by some gentlemen using the stage
names of ["The Three Stooges"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stooges).  They
operated from surprisingly early days: vaudeville in the 1920s, all the way up through the
1970s.  Their shtick was to play utterly stupid characters, drenched with physical farce
and slapstick.  It was actually a bit violent and sufficiently stupid that it was
discouraged by my parents.  

In their defense, I will point out that the Stooges seemed to be decent people in real
life, just actors who _pretended_ to be stupid and somewhat violent for a living.  And
they were pretty good at it!  

I mention this not because anybody cares about the bizarre American entertainments of my
childhood.  (Look, even _I_ don't care about it.  No need for you to look overly closely.)
I mention it instead, because in recent weeks I've seen three _egregiously stupid_
statements from prominent Republicans.  I mean, Republicans have been looking ridiculous
to me starting with Reagan, but this is kind of over the top.  


## The 3 _Republican_ Stooges

First up is Stooge #1: apparent lunatic
[Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene).
She's&hellip; special <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

- She buys into the far-right conspiracy theory [QAnon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAnon), 
  i.e., that Democrats are satanist cannibals running a child sex slavery ring.  
- She thinks Muslims should not be allowed in political office.  
- She's convinced the mass shootings of recent years were staged.   
- She talks about "Zionist supremacists" engineering Muslim migrations to Europe to drive whites to
  extinction.  
- She's said Democratic officials should be _executed._  

One of her more recently uncovered sins against rationality is: the California wildfires
were, in her peculiar opinion, deliberatey started by PG&amp;E in conjuction with the
Rothschild family using _secret Jewish space lasers_ to clear a path for high-speed rail.

Amusingly,
[DissentPins will sell you a shoulder patch for the Secret Jewish Space Laser Corps](https://dissentpins.com/products/secret-jewish-space-laser-corps-goyim-squad-patch), 
because since it's no longer secret you might as well flaunt it.  I thought it was a nice
touch that they have a Goyim Squad so guys like me (_goys_ like me?) can help out on on Shabbat.  

I mean, come on: are forest fires really so hard to believe that you'd prefer that
anti-Semitic, scientifically illiterate pile of crap?  (Apparently she hasn't gotten the
right-wing memo that antisemitic conspiracy theories are supposed to be updated, replacing
the Rothschilds with George Soros.  **Sigh:** it's not even _up to date_ crap!)  

Really, Republicans: why do you vote for people like that?  Why even be in the same party
as others who vote like that?

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-12-really-republicans-lg-move-moon-patch.jpg" width="400" height="424" alt="Louis Gohmert: US Forest Service can move the moon" title="Louis Gohmert: US Forest Service can move the moon" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Our second Stooge is the venerable [Representative Louis Gohmert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Gohmert),
upon whom we can always depend to say something bizarre.  In this _Reuters_ video, he asks
the US Forest Service to _change the orbit of the moon_ to stabilize climate change!  

That is physics illiteracy beyond belief.  Fortunately, should you need a shoulder patch
to tell the world you're on board with the Forest Service's space program, 
[DissentPins has you covered here, too.](https://dissentpins.com/products/u-s-forest-service-lunar-orbit-adjustment-program-patch)  

An article in the _Washington Post_ suggests it's not stupid for the obvious reasons, but
really an attempt at stupidity in another way.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  That is,
he knows we can't move the moon, but he thinks we can't stave off climate change either
unless we do something as drastic as moving the moon.  That's sort of&hellip; 2nd-order
stupidity?  

Just to make it perfect, when he was quoted he wasn't mad about being portrayed as asking
dimwit questions.  No, he was concerned that people would confuse his use of BLM for the
Bureau of Land Management and think he was talking to Black Lives Matter:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/replouiegohmert/status/1402658794182676483"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-12-really-republicans-twitter-1.jpg" width="550" height="863" alt="Gohmert @ Twitter: Worried you'll confuse the Bureau of Land Management with Black Lives Matter" title="Gohmert @ Twitter: Worried you'll confuse the Bureau of Land Management with Black Lives Matter"></a>

Yeah, that's the main worry when people quote you about trying to use the Forest Service
to move the moon: being confused with anti-racists.  (Me, I _want_ people to think I'm
anti-racist, because I want to _be_ anti-raciest.)  

Again, for the second Stooge: Really, Republicans: why do you vote for people like that?  Why even
be in the same party as others who vote like that?

The third Stooge (and I'm stopping at 3 only out of disgust, not because there aren't
more) is: [Representative Madison Cawthorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Cawthorn).
You might think we should cut him some slack, since he's a Congressional newbie just
elected last year in 2020.  And hey, he's only 25 years old, right?  But&hellip; there are
_limits_ to what we can overlook.  

As you may have noticed &mdash; and as we have been harping incessantly here at Chez
Weekend &mdash; the vaccination rate in the US is falling off, and we're not anywhere near
herd immunity country-wide, let alone total vaccination.  Some of that is hardcore
resistance from knuckleheads.  But a good deal is from communities that need some
outreach: maybe they don't speak English, maybe they can't get a day off from work, maybe
they can't travel to a vaccination center, maybe they need to hear from their local
faith community leaders, maybe they want to hear from their doctors, maybe&hellip; well,
lots of things.  So we're _doing those things:_ getting local community leaders to reach
out to their neighbors in low-vaccination areas.  

Seems benign enough, right?  

Ah, but not to this Boy Genius!  Cawthorn was at CPAC (Conservative Political Action
Committee &mdash; not a hopeful starting point) and said in an interview that this was a
plot to confiscate your guns and your Bibles <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>:  

> "The thing about the mechanisms they would have to build to be able to actually execute

<a href="https://twitter.com/RonFilipkowski/status/1413595082238873607"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-12-really-republicans-twitter-2.jpg" width="550" height="567" alt="Filipkowski @ Twitter: Rep Cawthorn says vaccine advocates will confiscate Bibles and guns" title="Filipkowski @ Twitter: Rep Cawthorn says vaccine advocates will confiscate Bibles and guns"></a>

Yeah.  Anything _but_ saving people's lives with vaccinations!  

(So far no guns 'n' Bible grabbin' shoulder patch from DissentPatches.  But it's early
  days yet, on this one.  Give it a few more days.)  

For the third (and last, for now) time: Really, Republicans: why do you vote for people
like that?  Why even be in the same party as others who vote like that?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Honest, I haven't done any cherry picking here, or at least none of which I'm aware.
Those are just the stories that happen to have presented themselves to me.  And if I'm
being honest, pretty much _all_ Congressional Republicans either look to me like the 3
Stooges above, or like Ted Cruz (who is smart, but just looks straight-up _evil_).  The
defense of Trump lunacy and double failure to impeach him is a stain upon all of them.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-12-really-republicans-pastrami.jpg" width="400" height="282" alt="Laser Space Station: Pastrami in the Canteen" title="Laser Space Station: Pastrami in the Canteen" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Look, I grew up Republican.  My family was Republican since there _was_ a Republican
Party.  But I got better.  If you're a Republican, you can too.  I promise it won't
hurt.  Democrats actually _try to make sense_, and that will come as an enormous relief if
you just try it out.  

Besides, the view from the laser space station is _stupendous._  Pretty good pastrami at the
canteen, too.  You might like it?
