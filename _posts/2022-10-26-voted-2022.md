So, today I voted.  


## Yes, Vote By Mail. But Not _By Mail_, By Dropbox.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-26-voted-2022-dropbox.jpg" width="400" height="479" alt="Your humble Weekend Editor dropping off his 2022 mid-term ballot at the town clerk's dropbox" title="Your humble Weekend Editor dropping off his 2022 mid-term ballot at the town clerk's dropbox" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I requested a mail-in ballot, as a way to get a reminder to vote.  However, given the
political mischief with the US Post Office <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, I didn't want
to have to trust them.  

So I deposited it directly in my town clerk's drop-box, as shown here.  

Fortunately, I didn't have to cope with armed idiots wearing tactical BS "guarding" the
dropbox to make sure only the people they liked could vote.  Apparently that's a thing
again, here in the US.  The racist South has infected Republicans in the red states to
attempt voter suppression with guns.  (Here in Massachusetts, we're pretty suspicious of
gun people.)  

I could vote as anti-Republican as I pleased &ndash; and it pleased me a _great_ deal &ndash;
then deposit it securely with my town clerk.  

Go thou and do likewise.  

__Remember:__ _No Republicans!_  Not ever.  Not for any imaginable office.  Not under any
conceivable circumstance.  Never.

Why does [Louis DeJoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_DeJoy) still have a job as
postmaster general?  How hard can it be to fire an obviously corrupt Trump appointee who
crippled postal delivery capability by selectively sabotaging blue districts?  How is that
not seditious conspiracy, as well? [↩](#fn1a)
