So, today I voted.  


## Yes, Vote By Mail. But Not By _Mail_&hellip; By _Dropbox._  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-10-26-voted-2022-dropbox.jpg" width="400" height="479" alt="Your humble Weekend Editor dropping off his 2022 mid-term ballot at the town clerk's dropbox" title="Your humble Weekend Editor dropping off his 2022 mid-term ballot at the town clerk's dropbox" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I requested a mail-in ballot, as a way to get a reminder to vote.  However, given the
political mischief with the US Post Office <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, I didn't want
to have to trust them.  

So I deposited it directly in my town clerk's drop-box, as shown here.  

Fortunately, I didn't have to cope with armed idiots wearing tactical BS "guarding" the
dropbox to make sure only the people they liked could vote.  Apparently that's a thing
again, here in the US.  The racist South has infected Republicans in the red states to
attempt voter suppression with guns.  (Here in Massachusetts, we're pretty suspicious of
gun people.)  

I could vote as anti-Republican as I pleased &ndash; and it pleased me a _great_ deal &ndash;
then deposit it securely with my town clerk.  

Go thou and do likewise.  

__Remember:__ _No Republicans!_  Not ever.  Not for any imaginable office.  Not under any
conceivable circumstance.  Never.


## Addendum 2022-Oct-27: Accepted for Counting

Being the anxious sort that I am, and being suspicious of how organizations work &amp;
don't work, I kept checking the status of my ballot.  The Secretary of the Commonwealth
maintains a web site where you can check the status of your mail-in ballot.  

Mine is shown here, as of now (2022-Oct-27 @ 12:37pm EDT US).  It used to say "not
returned", meaning they'd mailed it to me but I hadn't done anything about it.  (In my
defense, I was in Japan at the time!)  Indeed, it
still said that as of this morning.  But now, as of mid-day, the town clerk workers have
emptied their dropbox, sorted through things, scanned the barcodes, and put my ballot in
the queue to be counted (either now or on election day; I forget which way it goes here).  

So: ballot locked &amp; loaded, ready to be discharged against all Republican candidates
when the time comes.  

It's a great relief!

Why does [Louis DeJoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_DeJoy) still have a job as
postmaster general?  How hard can it be to fire an obviously corrupt Trump appointee who
crippled postal delivery capability by selectively sabotaging blue districts?  How is that
not seditious conspiracy, as well? [↩](#fn1a)
