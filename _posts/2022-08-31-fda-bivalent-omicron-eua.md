Today the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to both Pfizer and Moderna's
bivalent COVID-19 vaccines for classic and Omicron/BA.4/5 variants.  


## Bivalent Classic/Omicron Vaccines EUA'd at FDA  

The redoubtable Helen Branswell and Matthew Herper of _STAT News_ are on the case.
Branswell's tweet first alerted us:

She's pointing to Herper's summary article at _STAT News_. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
A little digging, of course, takes us to the original FDA press release. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
confirming what Branswell &amp; Herper wrote.  Also, the _PBS News Hour_ has a longish (42m55s)
interview with FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and CBER Director Peter Marks being
interviewed by Lauren Gardner, Cheyenne Haslett, Fiona Rutherford, Ferdus Al-Faruque,
Alexander Tin, Michael Erman, and Matthew Herper. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  (I
haven't finished watching it as of this writing; there's a _lot_ of stuff there!)  

Some of the high points:  
- The FDA did _not_ convene the VRBPAC, the committee of outside experts, to pass
  judgment.  Likely that's because,
  [as we've previously blogged, the VRBPAC specified by overwhelming vote this exact formulation on 2022-Jun-28]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-vrbpac-variant-boosters/).
  No need for further review; the FDA just did what they previously said they would do.  
- Both vaccines are _bivalent_, i.e., contain mRNA for the spike protein of the classic
  Wuhan virus as well as the fast-spreading Omicron/BA.4/5 variant.  (Thanks to commenter
  Mike who cut through my post-COVID brain fog to point out in a comment on a previous post that
  [BA.4 and BA.5 variants have high homology in the spike protein]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-1-month-later/#comment-25e11970-240c-11ed-b3ee-e7e3e7269d85),
  sharing mutations at L452R and F486V.)  
- Pfizer/BioNTech is authorized for ages 12 and up.  Moderna is for ages 18 and up.  No
  real idea why the difference, other than path-dependence on previous submissions and
  maybe the fact that Moderna tends to dose higher.  
- More time spent indoors during fall &amp; winter in the US is a good reason to enhance
  COVID-19 immunity, as is the fact that Omicron/BA.4/5 may be 
  [the most contagious disease yet encountered by humanity]({{ site.baseurl }}/most-infectious-disease/).
  Omicron/BA.5 now accounts for about 89% of cases in the US, with the bulk of the rest
  being BA.4.  So a vaccine that hits both of those _and_ the classic strain looks pretty
  much spot on.  
- Pfizer says they'll ship immediately after final QC checks, and they have capacity to
  ship 15 million doses by 2022-Sep-09.  Moderna is also shipping, though I couldn't
  find out how many by when.  Some sites may get doses as soon as this coming Saturday.  
- Some people are complaining that no human clinical trials have been done on this
  particular variant of the COVID-19 vaccine.  However:  
  - Previous trials have been done on the Beta variant, the Gamma variant, and both
    monovalent and bivalent BA.1.  All of them had 3 interesting properties:  
	- They worked, especially well against the variants targeted, but also against
      others.  
	- They were as safe as the original vaccine, i.e., very safe as shown by the original
      clinical trial and now by more than several billion doses given worldwide.  
	- The trials took so long that by the time they were done, the virus had moved on to a
      new variant.  So the trial was a tactical mistake.  
  - New influenza vaccines have a similar problem: very time-sensitive formulations, with
    a limited window for a trial.  Fortunately, we've done a _lot_ of flu vaccines in the
    past, and know how to extrapolate from animal studies without requiring a new human
    trial every year.  That's the strategy being applied here, and I have high confidence
    that it is the proper one: be fast, rely on past experience to guide your safety
    requirements.  

So: it looks like the bivalent classic/Omicron vaccines are safe (based on monovalent
studies and on the bivalent study with BA.1, and based on animal data with the bivalent
BA.4/5 version); it also looks like they are massively effective against the Omicron
variant.  (Unfortunately, I don't have a Kaplan-Meier curve to show you, but the previous
data on classic/BA.1 looked excellent, and we have no reason to think differently here.)  

## Next Steps  

&hellip; because _of course_ there's a next step before this can go into arms, right?  The
CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) has to meet and recommend this
FDA-approved therapy for practice in the US.  The ACIP meets tomorrow and Friday, to
discuss exactly this (see agenda item scheduled for 1pm - 5pm Friday). <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

So probably we'll have the final thumbs up (or maybe down, if something disastrous turns
up) by tomorrow afternoon.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Availability is apparently expected to start in September.  We may have to wait a bit,
since here at Chez Weekend we're just now recovering from a lovely late summer case of
COVID-19.  

But then&hellip; vax us up!  


## Addendum 2022-Aug-31, afternoon  

Eric Topol points out a preprint that dropped on _medR&chi;iv_ today <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Relevant to new BA.5 boosters for people with recent infection &lt; 2 months<br>
    &quot;B-cell responses to booster vaccines are impeded by recent infection&quot;

</blockquote>

So basically recent (&lt; 2 months) COVID-19 infection impairs B-cell responses induced by
the new BA.5 booster.  

That means your humble Weekend Editor &amp; Editrix need to wait a bit, as we just
finished a regrettable COVID-19 infection.  We started testing negative (post-rebound) in
late August, so we should get the new vaccine in late October or early November.  

One presumes the upcoming CDC guidelines to be decided tomorrow will have summat to say on
this subject.  

Annoying, but good to know.  


## Addendum 2022-Sep-01: CDC ACIP Meeting  

Our trusty safari guide, Helen Branswell of _STAT News_, is live-tweeting the meeting of
the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to set practice recommendations for
the bivalent classic/Omicron vaccines:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">

	meeting.<br>

    I will be live tweeting.<br>

    The meeting is being streamed here: <a href="https://t.co/rsFDXVwBUY">https://t.co/rsFDXVwBUY</a>

I'm not gonna trawl through all the primary presentations myself, this time.
(Post-COVID-19 brain fog, you know.  But if you want to make your own deep dive, then top
off your tanks and [go here to get the slide decks](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/slides-2022-09-01-02.html).)  So I'm gonna rely on Helen to be my guide to what's
happening (it took her 62 tweets!).  Seems like a good option for my tired brain.  

Some interesting highlights from her Twitter thread:  

- A few ACIP members _did not bother to show up,_ which is more than a mite peculiar.
  Initially there was confusion because they didn't do the roll call in alphabetical
  order, so it was hard to tell who was there.  But after a bit of back-n-forth, it looks
  like Kevin Ault is the only missing one, so 14/15 voting members are present.  Good enough.  
- We've given 12.6 billion &ndash; "billion" with a "b" &ndash; doses of COVID-19 vaccines
  since late 2020.  (Yeah, that's a lot.  But: Thre are about 8 billion currently living
  humans, so to get everybody double-vaxxed and double-boosted would be about 32 billion.)  
- In the US, it's 609 million doses.  With a bit over 300 million people, that means lots
  of people are unvaxxed, under-vaxxed, or not boosted.  This is why COVID-19 won't go
  away.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="Scobie @ CDC ACIP: Unvaccinated continue to account for most hospitalizations" title="Scobie @ CDC ACIP: Unvaccinated continue to account for most hospitalizations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="236" alt="Scobie @ CDC ACIP: double vaxxed/double boosted have 14x lower death risk" title="Scobie @ CDC ACIP: double vaxxed/double boosted have 14x lower death risk" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Here's a slide from Heather Scobie of the CDC, documenting that the unvaccinated have
  been, and still are, the bulk of hospitalizations.  Also, a second slide from her
  documenting that fully vaxxed and boosted adults have 14x lower death risk than the
  unvaxxed, and that a 2nd booster is 3x better than just 1 booster.  This is unsurprising
  to all except the unvaccinated/unboosted.  
- Antigenic cartography is a pain in the neck to explain to non-statistics people.  
  - It's pretty much like
    [multidimensional scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling),
    except considerably more fancy-pants.  Getting this into biologist and medical brains is
    harder than learning the actual math.  _Comme d'habitude._  
  - But the basic conclusion is that BA.4/5 are _really_ different, both from ancestral
    Wuhan and from other Omicron lineages.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="235" alt="Link-Gelles: Rapid waning efficacy against any symptomatic infection, across age groups" title="Link-Gelles: Rapid waning efficacy against any symptomatic infection, across age groups" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Here's a slide from Ruth Link-Gelles showing how rapidly vaccine efficacy wanes, and
  that this is across all age groups.  I must emphasize, very clearly, that this is
  efficacy _against any symptomatic infection._  Efficacy against severe disease,
  hospitalization, and death is much, much better.  And that's what we should care about,
  not just any old infection.  Your humble Weekend Editor got "just any old infection",
  and thanks to 4 doses of vaccine + paxlovid, it was merely very annoying.  
- Tom Shimabukuro reported on vaccine safety signals, which Helen says he's done "so often
  he could probably do it in his sleep."  While we could all use a nap, what he said
  instead of napping was:  
  - No interesting safety signals went off, including myocarditis in kids
    being kept at a very low level (like, 0 incidence for little guys 6 months to 4 years,
    for both vaccines).  
  - As usual, a little more reactogenicity for Moderna, because of the higher dose.  
  - Nothing else out of the ordinary.  
- They took only 10min for a lunch break, which tells you remote meetings from home can be
  efficient in unexpected ways. :-)  And we'll just step carefully around the land mines
  and avoid the public comment period, ok?  
- For those concerned about the lack of human trials: (a) this is how we do flu vaccine
  updates every year, and (b) Moderna is doing a _post hoc_ clinical trial anyway.
  They've already done additional trials for Beta, Gamma, and Omicron/BA.1.  The trial for
  this vaccine concluded enrollment yesterday: $N = 512$ subjects, probably going for
  50-200 days, which means we'll see the results late this year or sometime next year.
  (That's why we use the flu vaccine rules, to get out _ahead_ of the virus!)  
  - Later: Pfizer, of course, is also doing a similar clinical trial, currently ongoing.  
- I'm obscurely pleased to note that Helen was _also_ confused about the spikes of BA.4 and
  BA.5, as I was a couple days ago.  (Hey, it's not just me and my post-COVID-19 brain
  fog!)  Basically they're
  [identical spike proteins](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01911-2#:~:text=The%20spike%20proteins%20of%20BA,Alpha%20variant%20and%20the%20BA),
  so you get to claim a twofer with BA.4/5.  
- Moderna claims something quite interesting for their bivalent vaccine, namely that the
  __bivalent vaccine strictly dominates the classic vaccine in terms of antibody levels:__  
  - Antibodies levels against the Omicron strain are _superior_ to those from the classic
    vaccine, and  
  - Antibodies against the classic Wuhan virus are _noninferior_ to the classic vaccine.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="227" alt="Swanson/Pfizer @ CDC ACIP: bivalent vaccine better on classic variants than Omicron-only, comparable on Omicron variants" title="Swanson/Pfizer @ CDC ACIP: bivalent vaccine better on classic variants than Omicron-only, comparable on Omicron variants" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Here's a slide from Kena Swanson of Pfizer.  It looks at pseudovirus neutralization
  titers, by fold decrease from BA.1.  It compares the classic vaccine, the Omicron/BA.1
  vaccine, and the new bivalent classic + Omicron/BA.4-5 vaccine.  Result in mice:  
  - as good as the classic vaccine on classic variants, and  
  - as good as the BA.1-only vaccine on Omicron variants.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-5.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-5-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="237" alt="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: Propose simplifications to vaccination series" title="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: Propose simplifications to vaccination series" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Sara Oliver of the CDC is asking if the ACIP wants to simplify the vaccination series
  recommended down to 2 primary shots and 1 bivalent booster.  Seems good to me,
  effectiveness and simplicity are always in short supply.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-6.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-6-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="237" alt="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: little to no evidence of antigenic original sin" title="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: little to no evidence of antigenic original sin" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Also, she presented evidence that there was no immune tolerance (ceasing to respond to
  later boosters), and &ndash; a shown here &ndash; little evidence of antigenic original
  sin where the immune system gets locked into the original response.  Bivalent boosters
  seem to _improve_ the situation, if anything.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-7.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-7-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="237" alt="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: Omicron-driven wave of reinfection is the unmet medical need" title="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: Omicron-driven wave of reinfection is the unmet medical need" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- To illustrate the unmet medical need in the face of Omicron, Oliver presented data on
  reinfection of people who'd previously had COVID-19.  See the big bump in the curve
  starting early 2022?  That's Omicron.  That's why we want an Omicron-specific booster,
  to overdamp that wave.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-8.jpg">
  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-8-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="232" alt="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: Public more favorable to Omicron-updated booster than older boosters" title="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: Public more favorable to Omicron-updated booster than older boosters" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Vaccine uptake is always an issue, like a toothache that just _won't_ stop.  We
  initially had poor uptake of vaccination because of misinformation.  Boosters were even
  worse, with very few of those eligible in the US getting boosted, despite the evidence
  (e.g., above) that boosting _dramatically_ lowers the risk of hospitalization and
  death.  Why should we believe the bivalent boosters will be any different?  As shown
  here, the CDC did a survey, finding 72% of subjects would "definitely" or "probably" get
  an updated booster, which is way better than the old boosters did.  This seems pretty
  mysterious in terms of logic, but if it's true we should pounce on it to get the
  bivalent vaccine into people!  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-9.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-08-31-fda-bivalent-omicron-eua-cdc-9-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="233" alt="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: Benefits if uptake is like flu vaccine (left) or 80% of eligible (right)" title="Oliver @ CDC ACIP: Benefits if uptake is like flu vaccine (left) or 80% of eligible (right)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- CDC also analyzed the medical benefits, as shown in the slide here.  
  - The pessimistic left column is if the bivalent booster uptake is about like annual flu
    shots.  The more optimistic right column is if uptake gets to about 80% of the
    eligible population.  Ranges are 95% "credible interval" (the Bayesian version of a
    confidence limit, and for our purposes more or less the same thing: uncertainty).  
  - So we're looking at saving 100k - 160k lives, 1 - 1.7 million hospitalizations, 24 -
    48 million infections, and averting \$62 - 100 billion dollars in _direct_ medical
    costs.  Looks awfully good to me!  

And, that's it: approval 13-1 with 1 absence, and a reasonable set of practice
guidelines for both vaccines:

Honestly, I was _really_ surprised they worried so much about a human trial,
in spite of the fact that _this very committee_ handles flu vaccine updates every year in
this same way.  I just don't get why that's not a compelling argument.  But the single
"No" vote was from Pablo SÃ¡nchez, a professor of pediatrics at OSU, who really wanted a
clinical trial no matter what the cost of delay.  (It would take until at least late November.)

Still, we seem to have converged to the right place.

off on the committee's recommendation, so it is now A Done Deal.  In a weird turn of
events, that happened so fast I can't find the statement on the CDC web site, though it is
on some news sites.  Our safari guides at _STAT News_ are all over 
it <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>, reporting the CDC Director's statement _faster than
the CDC itself:_

Here at Chez Weekend, we look forward to getting it in late October, once we're 60 days
past our COVID-19 recovery!
