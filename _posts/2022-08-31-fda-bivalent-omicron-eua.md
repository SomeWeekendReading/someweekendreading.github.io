Today the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to both Pfizer and Moderna's
bivalent COVID-19 vaccines for classic and Omicron/BA.4/5 variants.  


## Bivalent Classic/Omicron Vaccines EUA'd at FDA  

The redoubtable Helen Branswell and Matthew Herper of _STAT News_ are on the case.
Branswell's tweet first alerted us:

She's pointing to Herper's summary article at _STAT News_. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
A little digging, of course, takes us to the original FDA press release. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
confirming what Branswell &amp; Herper wrote.  Also, the _PBS News Hour_ has a longish (42m55s)
interview with FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and CBER Director Peter Marks being
interviewed by Lauren Gardner, Cheyenne Haslett, Fiona Rutherford, Ferdus Al-Faruque,
Alexander Tin, Michael Erman, and Matthew Herper. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  (I
haven't finished watching it as of this writing; there's a _lot_ of stuff there!)  

Some of the high points:  
- The FDA did _not_ convene the VRBPAC, the committee of outside experts, to pass
  judgment.  Likely that's because,
  [as we've previously blogged, the VRBPAC specified by overwhelming vote this exact formulation on 2022-Jun-28]({{ site.baseurl }}/fda-vrbpac-variant-boosters/).
  No need for further review; the FDA just did what they previously said they would do.  
- Both vaccines are _bivalent_, i.e., contain mRNA for the spike protein of the classic
  Wuhan virus as well as the fast-spreading Omicron/BA.4/5 variant.  (Thanks to commenter
  Mike who cut through my post-COVID brain fog to point out in a comment on a previous post that
  [BA.4 and BA.5 variants have high homology in the spike protein]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-1-month-later/#comment-25e11970-240c-11ed-b3ee-e7e3e7269d85),
  sharing mutations at L452R and F486V.)  
- Pfizer/BioNTech is authorized for ages 12 and up.  Moderna is for ages 18 and up.  No
  real idea why the difference, other than path-dependence on previous submissions and
  maybe the fact that Moderna tends to dose higher.  
- More time spent indoors during fall &amp; winter in the US is a good reason to enhance
  COVID-19 immunity, as is the fact that Omicron/BA.4/5 may be 
  [the most contagious disease yet encountered by humanity]({{ site.baseurl }}/most-infectious-disease/).
  Omicron/BA.5 now accounts for about 89% of cases in the US, with the bulk of the rest
  being BA.4.  So a vaccine that hits both of those _and_ the classic strain looks pretty
  much spot on.  
- Pfizer says they'll ship immediately after final QC checks, and they have capacity to
  ship 15 million doses by 2022-Sep-09.  Moderna is also shipping, though I couldn't
  find out how many by when.  Some sites may get doses as soon as this coming Saturday.  
- Some people are complaining that no human clinical trials have been done on this
  particular variant of the COVID-19 vaccine.  However:  
  - Previous trials have been done on the Beta variant, the Gamma variant, and both
    monovalent and bivalent BA.1.  All of them had 3 interesting properties:  
	- They worked, especially well against the variants targeted, but also against
      others.  
	- They were as safe as the original vaccine, i.e., very safe as shown by the original
      clinical trial and now by more than several billion doses given worldwide.  
	- The trials took so long that by the time they were done, the virus had moved on to a
      new variant.  So the trial was a tactical mistake.  
  - New influenza vaccines have a similar problem: very time-sensitive formulations, with
    a limited window for a trial.  Fortunately, we've done a _lot_ of flu vaccines in the
    past, and know how to extrapolate from animal studies without requiring a new human
    trial every year.  That's the strategy being applied here, and I have high confidence
    that it is the proper one: be fast, rely on past experience to guide your safety
    requirements.  

So: it looks like the bivalent classic/Omicron vaccines are safe (based on monovalent
studies and on the bivalent study with BA.1, and based on animal data with the bivalent
BA.4/5 version); it also looks like they are massively effective against the Omicron
variant.  (Unfortunately, I don't have a Kaplan-Meier curve to show you, but the previous
data on classic/BA.1 looked excellent, and we have no reason to think differently here.)  

## Next Steps  

&hellip; because _of course_ there's a next step before this can go into arms, right?  The
CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) has to meet and recommend this
FDA-approved therapy for practice in the US.  The ACIP meets tomorrow and Friday, to
discuss exactly this (see agenda item scheduled for 1pm - 5pm Friday). <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

So probably we'll have the final thumbs up (or maybe down, if something disastrous turns
up) by tomorrow afternoon.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Availability is apparently expected to start in September.  We may have to wait a bit,
since here at Chez Weekend we're just now recovering from a lovely late summer case of
COVID-19.  

But then&hellip; vax us up!
