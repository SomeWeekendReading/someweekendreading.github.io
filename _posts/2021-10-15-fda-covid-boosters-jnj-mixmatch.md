Today the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meets to
review the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen application for 3rd dose boosters of their
COVID-19 vaccine.  They will also at least discuss the 3x3 mix-and-match booster study.  


## Kind of not as interested?  

To be honest, the J&amp;J vaccine just doesn't interest me as much.  I wish well to all
those who got it, but it's just a bit outside my sphere of experience.  So I won't be
blogging this hearing in as much detail as for Pfizer and Moderna.

That being said, I'll happily assemble here a bibliography of the meeting materials for
anyone who _does_ care to dig in, and will gratefully read any summary they might write:  
- Helen Branswell &amp; Matt Herper at _STAT News_ are doing their usual live-blogging, so
  that's always a good place to look for callouts of the main 
  points. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  
- The FDA's meeting announcemet page <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, same as for
  yesterday, now has new materials for J&amp;J uploaded.  The rest of the meeting
  materials are available there.  
- The official agenda <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> calls for a decision on the J&amp;J
  booster, then discussion of the mix-and-match trial.  
- The YouTube livestream of the hearings is also available, embedded here for the truly
  compulsive.  (Did I really just say that?)  


## A Glimpse of J&amp;J Efficacy Persistence

The one extract I will highlight from a quick trawl through the 
slides <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> is this one: it
appears J&amp;J efficacy has not waned as much as others.  Nobody really has much of any
idea why this is the case, or even how much to trust the data that says so.  

The situation is less copacetic when you consider just symptomatic COVID-19 efficacy.  It
peaks at about 65% one month after vaccination, and then declines to about 30%, with the
95% confidence interval _not_ bounded away from 0, i.e., there's some chance it has
vanished.  

If for some reason you're interested in the US-only data, it's slightly better: moderate
efficacy, reasonably persistent over time.  (Though, as you can see at the end, the
confidence interval widens out.  That's probably just because there are fewer and fewer
people who have had the vaccine long enough, not that it's fading.)  I have no idea why
this should be better than the previous international data.  

In one sense, this is good news: J&amp;J endures.  In another sense, it weakens the case
for boosters, unless boosters are to get to _even higher_ levels of immunity, comparable
to the mRNA vaccines, or to repair the efficacy against non-severe COVID-19.  People are
starting to say this should be a 2-shot vaccine from the start, maybe with the second dose
at 6 months.  Which is kinda now.  

There does seem to be less clotting risk with the 2nd dose of J&amp;J compared to the
first, so that at least is good.  


## The Discussion Period  

According to Helen Branswell, the discussion was not to J&amp;J's liking.  They want to
remain a 1-dose vaccine because that appeals to some people, and they _don't_ want
heterologous boosters with somebody else's vaccines.  However, the VRBPAC members think
otherwise:  

> __1:25 p.m.:__ This is turning out to be a bad meeting for J&J. It’s clearly the view of a
> lot of VRBPAC members that this vaccine should be a two-dose vaccine. And it’s also
> apparent that the FDA is thinking about whether the boost for the J&J vaccine should be
> another brand of vaccine.  


## The Vote  

At 1:30pm, the vote came down unanimously in favor of allowing boosters: 19 Yes, 0 No, 0
Abstain.  The question implied "at least 2 months" after the first dose, but didn't
exactly specify when.  


## The Mix-and-Match Clinical Trial  

The VRBPAC won't actually vote on this, but they will discuss it, making "general
observations" to the FDA on the heterologous vaccine 
study. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> "Heterologous" is just terminological inflation;
heterologous and homologous just mean "same" and "different" as they're used here.  

Obviously, this was a government-run trial at the NIH/NIAID, since we can never expect
private companies to do trials with their competitors' vaccines!  In fact, during the
J&amp;J presentation, according to Helen Branswell, J Van Hoof of J&amp;J appeared to try
to _block consideration of heterologous boosts_, asserting without proof that their safety
had not been proven as much as J&amp;J boosted with J&amp;J had been.  Was he
unaware of the safety study being presented _this very afternoon?!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-15-fda-covid-boosters-jnj-mixmatch-nih-1.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="NIH: All 9 possible pairwise combinations and orderings of 3 vaccines" title="NIH: All 9 possible pairwise combinations and orderings of 3 vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
This study used all 3 vaccines in combination with each other, in both orders in a 2-dose
scheme.  Imagine the 3x3 grid that makes, and you get 9 combinations including the
controls where you used the same vaccine twice.  It looks like they
did one dose of the first vaccine, then 12 weeks later did the second dose and called that
the "booster".  Seems rational enough to me.  Each of the 9 arms (!) had 50 participants,
so it's kind of small, but good for exploratory purposes.  

For immunogenicity, they measured both pseudovirus neutralization (D614G, with Beta and
Delta still in process) and IgG antibody binding.  So they didn't just measure blood
antibody levels in subjects, which is very good indeed.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-15-fda-covid-boosters-jnj-mixmatch-nih-2.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="NIH: Pseudovirus neutralization for all 9 possible combinations" title="NIH: Pseudovirus neutralization for all 9 possible combinations" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-10-15-fda-covid-boosters-jnj-mixmatch-nih-3.jpg" width="400" height="224" alt="NIH: IgG antibody binding for 9 vax combinations and 3 VoCs" title="NIH: IgG antibody binding for 9 vax combinations and 3 VoCs" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The result seems to be, approximately: hey, it worked.  

The first slide here shows the result for pseudovirus neutralization: bigger is better,
and the vertical axis is on a log scale.  This is for the D614G variant.  It looks like
the mRNA vaccines all do comparably well with whatever booster happens; the J&amp;J does
better with an mRNA boost than with itself.  

The second slide shown here shows the result for IgG antiobody binding on all 9 vax
combinations, this time using 3 variants of concern: WT, Alpha, and Delta.  They all get
better with boosts and time, but J&amp;J boosting itself was the weakest of the lot.  

They also reported safety outcomes, basically saying nothing special happened.  

So it looks to me like the conclusion _should_ be:  
- heterologous vaccines work (so we should do them), and  
- the J&amp;J vaccine boosting itself might be something to avoid (it's probably ok, just
  not as good as the others).  

Too bad the VRBPAC won't be allowed to vote/recommend on this topic, as the data is
somewhat early!  But maybe in the _near_ future.  

&hellip;more updates here as the hearings progress&hellip;  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

1. J&amp;J boosters approved, sort of:  
   - On the one hand, J&amp;J boosters were recommended to the FDA by unanimous vote of
     the entire VRBPAC.  
   - On the other hand, sentiment seems to be that this should have been a 2-dose vaccine from
     the start, and heterologous boosters with another vaccine might be better.  

   So from the J&amp;J viewpoint, they might see this as 1 win and 2 losses.
