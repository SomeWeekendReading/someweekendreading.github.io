There have now been around _10 billion_ COVID-19 vaccine doses given.  What should we make
of that?  


## How many doses, now?

[Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan), astrophysicist and host of popular
science American book and TV show _Cosmos_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
used to describe astronomically large numbers with the phrase "billions and billions".  We
used to joke that there needed to be a new unit in the metric system, the Sagan, with a
value of some multiple of $10^{9}$, for multi-billion quantities.  

In April of 2021, [we noted that the COVID-19 vaccination campaign had given out its billionth dose]({{ site.baseurl }}/billionth-dose/).  Today, [Eric Topol of the Scripps Research Translational Institute](https://drerictopol.com/meet-eric-topol/) reminds us that we mark another order of magnitude progress in the almost exactly 8 months since then:

    10 billion doses in 1 year is really a stunning human achievement<br>
    Yet still much work to do in 2022

## The Weekend Conclusion  

Several thoughts come to my mind:  
- How often is it we get to do 10 billion of _anything,_ at least above the atomic scale?!  
- Anybody who tells you the vaccines are "untested"&hellip; is a fool.  
  - This is, operationally, the largest
    [Phase IV trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_IV)
    of a drug, _ever in humanity's history._  
  - If there had been severe side-effects, they would be seen now; despite the hysterics,
    hyperbole and outright lying on the right, no such effects are seen.  
  - Step outside the Republican propaganda bubble, and at least _try_ to be reality-based
    here.  Try the [litany of Gendlin](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/litany-of-gendlin),
    or the [litany of Tarski](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/litany-of-tarski) maybe.  
- Alas, there are 8 billion people currently sharing the planet.  (By the standard of
  "billions and billions", we have approximately 1 Sagan of living humans.)  
  - Each person needs 3 shots of mRNA with current technology, or 24 billion doses.  
  - So 10 billion doses means we've done only 41% of the job.  
  - We definitely need to pick up the pace for the developing world, especially Africa.  

We still have to save 60% of humanity.  They should live and not die: it's
