Do our commitments of money &amp; time reveal our priorities as a society?  


## Our Priorities  

I've forgotten who told me this, years ago.  It was something like: "Show me where you
spend your money and your time, and I'll tell you what your priorities are."  I both love
and hate that saying.  On the one hand, it invites introspection about how well one lives
ones values.  On the other hand, it _strongly_ invites guilt in someone like me prone to
depression, anxiety, and excessive scrupulosity.  

Still, it seems like we ought to be able to do something like that society-wide: do
our social priorities reveal our values?

This graph <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> was prepared by Mark J Perry, of the American
Enterprise Institute.  Let's get this out of the way first: I _despise_ the American
Enterprise Institute.  They're a hard-right think-tank, issuing mostly propaganda papers
that undermine anything like sensible policies in health care, equality, &hellip; You
name it, if I'm for it they're guaranteed to be against it with some plausible-sounding
reason that facile, glib, and evil.  

I say this so you will take me seriously when I say this graph captures&hellip;
_something_&hellip; important about the American _zeitgeist._  
- The horizontal axis is time in years, 2000-Jan to 2022-Jun, so 22 years.  
- The vertical axis is the relative change in price over that time.  
- Each curve is for a particular type of goods &amp; services.  
- The red curves have increased _more_ than inflation; the blue curves have increased
  less, or even dramatically _decreased._  
  
__NB:__ There's a bit of wool being pulled over your eyes here, sometimes called the
[hedonic treadmill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill).  That says the
nature of goods changes over time, usually for the better.  We become _accustomed_ to that
improvement, and often erroneously project it into the past.  A car from the 2000 model
year is not the same as a care from the 2022 model year!  

Most consumer electronics are like this, due to rapid change.  Other things are like this
too, such as health care: you'd much rather have a cancer diagnosis in 2022 than in 2000,
because we can help you a _lot_ better now!  So you might expect health care to be more
expensive, but then why do you expect consumer electronics to go the other way?  

So we shouldn't take this as absolute truth, and extending it to longer time periods would
probably be even more misleading.  But for 22 years, let's think about where prices
increased with inflation and where they decreased, and why.  

The thing to note is the nature of the goods and services on the red and blue
trajectories.  
- The blue curves &ndash; stuff that's gotten cheaper in real terms &ndash; are mostly
  _physical_ goods, and in some cases luxury goods.  
- The red curves are largely _services,_ like health care, child care, and higher
  education.  

Now, there can be many reasons for that rather dramatic divide.  
- The AEI folk will rant endlessly and senselessly about 'socialism', claiming that
  government intervention in health care caused the price increase.  
  
  This is, of course, pernicious nonsense.  Western European countries are far more
  credibly democratic socialist in their universal health care polices, and they do _not_
  see this kind of price increase while seeing _better_ health care outcomes than the US.
  
  Far more likely is that the price rise is the product of a large number of private
  entities each seeking 'their share' of the large flow of health care money.  Look at an
  itemized health care bill in the US sometime: do you even _recognize_ some of the
  entities demanding a share of your insurance payment?  I often do not!  

- A somewhat more likely interpretation is that the services are mostly not tradeable,
  whereas the physical goods are largely tradeable.  The graph covers a time period when
  there was a lot of relatively tariff-free trade, and thus pricing pressure on
  manufacturers to be at least as good as the imported stuff.  
  
  Of course, in the US we've dismantled that world with the Trumpian tariffs, military
  violence, kidnappings domestic &amp; foreign, and general bombast.  Perhaps in the
  future we will see the blue curves rise sharply with the impairment of international
  trade?  Or will we see all the curves collapse in a deflationary disaster, like the last
  time we shut down global trade in the Great Depression?  
  
- But the most likely interpretation, to my non-economist intuition, is that this chart
  shows us _what we care about the most._  
  
  To our blame:  
  - We value luxury goods like TVs, computers, and cars a lot, but&hellip;  
  - We do _not_ value social goods that improve the lives of all of us, like health care,
    education, child care, clean air & water, and cheap, nutritious food.  
	
  To the extent that this shows us where we spend our time &amp; money making things
  better, this is a moral insight into the flawed nature of our society.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

We _know_ better, but we are sadly reluctant to _do_ better.  

So let us encourage each other to do better.  

I can do better.  So can you.
