[Randall Munroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe), the 
[mad]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#TheDivineMadness) cartoonist behind 
[XKCD](https://xkcd.com/), explains COVID-19 vaccine approvals.  And channels Lord Rutherford.
Simultaneously.  


## Data and its best summary ever  

The Kaplan-Meier curves for COVID-19 infections in the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna trials
are, of course, beautiful:

[XKCD #2400](https://xkcd.com/2400/) has a quick summary of the situation, as always in
the simplest and clearest possible terms.  That's more or less what XKCD is _for_, right?
Absurdly clear explanations of phenomena absurdly trivial and absurdly important.
Sometimes simultaneously.

## Didn't somebody already say that?  

He seems to be channeling Lord Rutherford, according to
[this blog's quotes page]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#the-statistical-ones):

>If your result needs a statistician, then you should design a better experiment. &mdash; [Ernest Rutherford, 1st Baron Rutherford of Nelson, and Nobel Laureate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Rutherford)  

While frustrating to a statistician, he's right: you should _of course_ choose the
experiment design that gives such a clear answer you don't _need_ statistics.  

Statisticians are for the situations where that's not even possible.  Which is most of 
the time.
