Today the FDA is refusing an application for an mRNA flu vaccine, for reasons which are as
deadly as they are astoundingly stupid.  


## They Did _What?!_  

Remember Moderna?  The company that made one of the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19?  

They've had a robust research program numerous clinical development programs for things
other than just COVID-19: several cancer vaccines, some disease vaccines, and in
particular a flu vaccine.  
- Their flu vaccine trial involved 40,000 people, starting 2024-Sept.  
- The trial design was previously accepted by the FDA, and by the medical regulatory
  authorities in _every other nation on the planet_ where it was simultaneously
  submitted.  (That appears to include at least the European Union, Australia, and
  Canada.)  
- It seems to be at least somewhat superior to existing flu vaccines in people over
  age 50.  It was, in fact, 27% more effective _vs_ symptomatic flu, and 49% more effective 
  _vs_ hospitalization.  

That "demonstration of non-inferiority to standard of care" is the gold standard: you
compare against how we'd usually treat a disease, and see if you can do better.  Trials
like this are designed in conjunction with the FDA, who usually give a couple of _years_ of
advice on how to do it the way that's best for them.  It's never a surprise to the FDA
when you submit a clinical trial result, since they helped you design it in the first
place.

So it was with some alarm today that the FDA has refused even to consider the submission
of the Moderna flu vaccine trial results, via an _AP_ article.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>
That was sufficiently alarming to be worth checking to make sure other outlets in and out
of the US news bubble agreed, so here are some pointers to
_The Guardian_ <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> and the "ol' reliables" at _STAT News_,
Matthew Herper and Helen Branswell. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>   

So, ok.  I'm satisfied this is real news.  It is, however, _extremely_ unusual!  

I have _never_ seen a "refusal to review" letter when the agency had previously approved
the trial.  Apparently the object is, in the words of FDA vaccine director Vinay Prasad,
that the trial was not an "adequate and well-controlled trial" because the standard of
comparison wasn't the FDA's preferred flu vaccine.  This is also _extremely_ unusual,
since that was hashed out a couple years ago and the FDA agreed that the control vaccine
used in the trial _was_ ok and gave it the green light.  

The consequences will be absolutely damning, going beyond medical risk to research risk in
not pursuing vaccines in the future.  As _The Guardian_ put it:  

> “This is likely to discourage industry from investing in future influenza vaccines, and
> makes working with the US FDA uncertain and problematic,” said Dorit Reiss, professor of
> law at UC Law San Francisco.  
>  
> “They are refusing to review a new vaccine with a more flexible technology, while
> creating a real risk we will not have traditional vaccines for next year.”  

Future vaccine innovation will almost immediately move overseas.  

Moderna has just announced exactly that, additionally killing projects because the US no
longer makes it possible to break even on their current vaccine candidates for
Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, and shingles virus.  These cures are now lost to
humanity; even when governments change it may take generations to rebuild the capacity now
being destroyed:  

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markhisted.org/post/3mepsgtdo722m"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-11-fda-nixes-mrna-flu-vax-moderna-1.jpg" width="550" height="498" alt="Moderna, quoted on BlueSky: shelving vaccine candidates for Epstein-Barr, herpes simplex, and shingles" title="Moderna, quoted on BlueSky: shelving vaccine candidates for Epstein-Barr, herpes simplex, and shingles" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

And, of course, infectious diseases are not the only things being lost.  There are some
very good cancer vaccines in the pipeline; in fact, immuno-oncology was perhaps the _most_
promising area when I retired from oncology in 2020.  Some of the results are startlingly
good:  

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shoe.bsky.social/post/3mekpnlzvz22q"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-11-fda-nixes-mrna-flu-vax-bsky-1.jpg" width="550" height="218" alt="Poster @ BlueSky: anecdote about participation in a breast cancer mRNA vaccine trial" title="Poster @ BlueSky: anecdote about participation in a breast cancer mRNA vaccine trial" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

&hellip; but, apparently no more.  It seems
[Moloch demands even more lives be sacrificed](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/),
with Republicans trading more lives for power.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-11-fda-nixes-mrna-flu-vax-stat-2.jpg" width="400" height="161" alt="Lawrence @ STAT News: Vinay Prasad overrules FDA science staff to reject mRNA vaccine" title="Lawrence @ STAT News: Vinay Prasad overrules FDA science staff to reject mRNA vaccine" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
It appears <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> that the FDA scientists were fine with
Moderna's trial, but were overruled _personally_ by Trump/Kennedy prot&eacute;g&eacute;
[Vinay Prasad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinay_Prasad), who is
currently the controversial head of the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER).  The Wikipedia page on Prasad, linked here, notes that Prasad tends to push
emotional hot buttons and some of his writing has amounted to fearmongering.  

So&hellip; it's _personal_ with Trump/RFKJr/Prasad, now.  


## The Reaction  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-11-fda-nixes-mrna-flu-vax-lowe-1.jpg" width="400" height="188" alt="Lowe @ In the Pipeline: Infuriating" title="Lowe @ In the Pipeline: Infuriating" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Reaction among scientists has been swift and relentlessly negative, as you might expect.  

And it's not just me: here's an article from renowned med-chem writer Derek Lowe, a man
normally of somewhat conservative/libertarian leanings, who over the last few years has
become as enraged against republicans as your humble Weekend 
Editor. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  

> Last night brought news that the FDA has refused to review Moderna’s application for
> their new mRNA influenza vaccine, and more details have emerged so far today. All of
> them are infuriating.  

Like me, he sees this as _extremely_ unusual, rising to "unheard-of" territory:  

> Right off, let’s just make clear that an outright refusal-to-review rejection like this
> is quite unusual, since biopharma companies (large and small) typically work with the
> FDA during their trials to make sure that things are being run in a way that the agency

> &hellip;  
> It is especially unusual for a vaccine. If there is a prior example like this with the
> FDA, I am unaware of it. Moderna seems baffled by the decision in their public
> statements, and I can’t blame them.  

And it really does seem to be some personal jihad down to Prasad:  

> It appears that the agency - well, Vinay Prasad - told the company that they did not run
> an adequate trial &hellip;  Prasad signed the rejection letter personally, which is also
> something I’ve never heard of before, so draw your own conclusions.  

The controls used by Moderna were absolutely reasonable, and even though the FDA a couple
years ago had some suggestions, they signed off on these controls (GSK's Fluarix
quadrivalent vaccine for adults 50 or older).  

Derek reaches about the same conclusions as me (__emphasis__ added):  

> And let’s get real here: this application is being denied, __personally by Vinay Prasad
> and against the recommendation of the FDA’s remaining experts, because he and the rest
> of the Trump administration are hostile to vaccines in general and to mRNA technology in

> public health measures available to the human race&hellip;__ 
>  
> Like so many of the Trump administration’s actions, this is simultaneously weird,
> dangerous, and profoundly stupid. And we are all going to pay the price for it.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-11-fda-nixes-mrna-flu-vax-wsj-1.jpg" width="400" height="221" alt="WSJ Editorial Board: Prasad damages medical innovation" title="WSJ Editorial Board: Prasad damages medical innovation" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Now, I can already hear the objection that this is just the opinion of some weird, hippy
scientists, and who cares what the longhairs think?  (Though my hair is considerably
longer than Derek's.)  

How about _The Wall Street Journal_?  Is that sufficiently non-hippy to pass your
conservative purity tests?  Because the _WSJ_ coverage <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn5)</sup> points
the finger of blame directly at Prasad, and is subtitled, "Does the White House know the
harm he's doing to public health?"  

It doesn't let up, either, with this opening paragraph:  

> It’s hard to recall a regulator who has done as much damage to medical innovation in as
> little time as Vinay Prasad. In his latest drive-by shooting, the leader of the Food and
> Drug Administration’s vaccine division rejected Moderna’s mRNA flu vaccine without even
> a cursory review. This is arbitrary government at its worst.  

They report that Prasad wanted Moderna to have used a high-dose flu vaccine in the control
arm.  This is _not even possible:_  
- In the US, those are only for seniors over 65.  This trial was about people over 50, for
  whom the high-dose vaccines would have been medically inappropriate.  
- The high-dose vaccines are not even available in Europe, where the trial was largely
  conducted.  
  
So Prasad demands a medically inappropriate &amp; not legally available control vaccine,
thereby making it _impossible_ for the trial to be conducted.  


## But Of Course, We'll Always Have&hellip; _Ivermectin?!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-11-fda-nixes-mrna-flu-vax-stat-3.jpg" width="400" height="291" alt="Pradham @ STAT News: NCI to study ivermectin in cancer, alarming career scientists" title="Pradham @ STAT News: NCI to study ivermectin in cancer, alarming career scientists" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Instead, we are apparently funding a trial of ivermectin in cancer, of all 
things. <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>  

Lots of things kill cancer.  Usually they do so at doses that kill normal tissue, too.
Normal scientists know this.  Trump/RFKJr/Prasad apparently do not, or are willing to
pretend not to know it.  

This is pure political appeasement to the Trump base, who have a superstitious attachment
to ivermectin.  Incorrigibly persistent readers of this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody
Reads (CLBTNR) will recall that, in the past, we've had vehemently negative things to say
about ivermectin. <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup> <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>
<sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup> 
<sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  

Let's be clear about a few things:  
- Ivermectin is a perfectly reasonable drug for treating worm infestations, lice, and
  other invertebrate parasites.  

  If you've got worms, this might be the drug for you.  In the US, worms in humans are
  rare, but it's widely used for veterinary purposes, hence the name "horse paste".  
- Ivermectin does not treat COVID-19, and never has.  

  The hints otherwise came from clinical trials conducted in countries where worm
  infestations were common.  Worm infestations make everything worse.  So if you have
  worms _and_ COVID-19, ivermectin will help a little.  (But what you _really_ need in
  that case is ivermectin _and_ paxlovid, because you have _2 separate problems._)  
- Ivermectin is a "virtue signal" _extremely_ strongly associated with right-wing
  disinformation.  
  
  It's so _hard_ to get people to let go of ivermectin because they don't want to lose
  their entire tribal identity as Trumps or Republicans.  It's difficult to admit you've
  been conned!  

But&hellip; now apparently the knuckleheads want to test ivermectin in cancer.  The linked
article points out that _there is no evidence_ that ivermectin treats cancer.  You will,
of course, be unsurprised to hear that the new head of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is a
Trumper.  

You _do not want_ to be in this clinical trial!  The "treatment" arm is a nonsensical
application of a de-worming drug, so your best bet would be to get in the control arm,
where you'd get standard of care.  Though&hellip; given Prasad's fixation on placebos,
maybe you'd get no treatment at all &ndash; in violation of every medical ethis code.  

Internal NCI scientists have reacted about as you might think:  

> The decision by the world’s premier cancer research institute to study ivermectin as a
> cancer treatment has alarmed career scientists at the agency.  
>  
> “I am shocked and appalled,” one NCI scientist said. “We are moving funds away from so
> much promising research in order to do a preclinical study based on nonscientific
> ideas. It’s absurd.”  

Absurd.  

And for that absurdity, we kill mRNA vaccines for infectious diseases and cancer.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-11-fda-nixes-mrna-flu-vax-viscap-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-11-fda-nixes-mrna-flu-vax-viscap-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="953" alt="Lu @ Visual Capitalist: Country reputation rankings in 2024 and 2025; note dramatic fall of US" title="Lu @ Visual Capitalist: Country reputation rankings in 2024 and 2025; note dramatic fall of US" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The rest of the world looks askance at the utter clownshod goings-on in the US.  Here,
for example, is a visualization from _Visual Capitalist_ <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>
of the relative rankings of countries by reputations, and how they changed from 2024 to
2025, i.e., after the advent of Trump.  
- A couple oddities: Cuba &amp; Venezuela are in the list on the left, but disappear.
  Instead, Taiwan and Kuwait suddenly appear on the right.  Hmmm.  
- The US in recent years has never been terribly highly ranked abroad.  We are too
  violent, too impulsive, too superstitious, and too prone to demagoguery.  
  
  Hence, on the left hand side, you see the US in about the middle at rank 30, between
  Brazil and Ukraine.  So we're not _starting_ from a very reputable place.  
- With the (re-)advent of Trump, our reputation abroad has plunged!  

  We are now at position 48, between Kuwait and Kazakhstan.  
  
  _This_ is how the rest of the world sees us.  Trump in particular, and Republicans in
  general, are _not_ brave visionaries.  They are incompetent, dangerous, and fascist.  

We are ruled by ignorant children.  Their understanding of science just superstition.
Their every other thought is about acquiring &amp; keeping power, regardless of who might
be hurt.  In this case, their performative fear of mRNA vaccines is an attempt to cement
power in their superstitious base.  

By forbidding a potentially superior vaccine while offering the most ignorant of excuses,
they set up a situation where people will die.  But if it's in the service of Republican
power, they probably think that's acceptable.
