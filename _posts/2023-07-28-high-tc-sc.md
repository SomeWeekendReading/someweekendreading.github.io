Last Saturday, 2022-Jun-22, two preprints from Korean physicists dropped on
[_ar$\chi$iv_](https://arxiv.org).  They claim room-temperature, ambient-pressure
superconductivity in a chemically relatively non-exotic material.  Let's see what they've
got.  


## Bearers of the News  

Via Sabine Hossenfelder &amp; Douglas Natelson came the news:  

<a href="https://twitter.com/skdh/status/1683841656704106497"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-hoss-1.jpg" width="550" height="287" alt="Hossenfelder &amp; Natelson @ Twitter: Physicists corralling students into labs to look at high-Tc superconductor paper from Korea" title="Hossenfelder &amp; Natelson @ Twitter: Physicists corralling students into labs to look at high-Tc superconductor paper from Korea" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

Ok, I confess: I had a few twinges from flashbacks to the 80s when the cold fusion via
electrochemistry stuff came out.  I wanted to believe, so _hard._  And it was _painful_ to
see the layers peeled back as Pons &amp; Fleischmann were slowly flayed alive and exposed
as having no clue.  

Still&hellip; "This one looks potentially interesting."  

You can get conned if you're too easily convinced; but nobody should want the boring life
of refusing to hope good things are true.  So let's dive in and see if there's reason to
hope here.  


## A Tiny, Tiny Bit of Background on Superconductivity  

This all gets more comprehensible both as physics and a potentially monumental achievement
if you understand the background a little bit.  

### Ancient (20th Century) Prehistory: Type I and Type II Superconductors

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-Kamerlingh-Onnes.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-Kamerlingh-Onnes-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="245" alt="H. Kamerlingh-Onnes's discovery of superconducting Hg (1911)" title="H. Kamerlingh-Onnes's discovery of superconducting Hg (1911)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The first superconductor discovered was in 1911, by Kamerlingh-Onnes looking at Hg in
liquid He.  At $T_c \sim 4.2\ \mbox{K}$, just a gnat's whisker above absolute zero, the
resistance went to 0 and all magnetic field was expelled.  At various combinations of
current and magnetic field, the new phase of matter "quenched" back to normal.  It's hard
to overemphasize how _weird_ this result was: currents sustained infinitely for no effort,
sudden phase changes for no obvious reason, and even odder heat capacity results.  

What Kamerlingh-Onnes was even _thinking,_ doing resistance measurements on random metals at those
extremely difficult to reach temperatures is beyond me.  It always smelled a bit
like doing plasma physics at the bottom of [Death Valley](https://www.nps.gov/deva/index.htm).
I mean, sure, you _could_ do that&hellip; but why _would_ you?!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-type-II-sc.jpg" width="400" height="470" alt="Type II superconductors: vortics of superconductivity in a normal matrix" title="Type II superconductors: vortics of superconductivity in a normal matrix" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Those were Type I superconductors: nice clean phase transition, well defined
critical currents and magnetic fields, complete magnetic flux expulsion (Meissner Effect),
usually pure metals, and absurdly low transition temperatures.  Fascinating physics, but
not much good from an engineering viewpoint.  

Then in the 1930s came Type II superconductors: often a mix of materials, squishy phase
transition, partial magnetic flux exclusion, higher $T_c$, forming vortex domains of
superconductivity that became bulk superconductors because of how the domains linked up.
Still fascinating, marginally useful because $T_c$ was so low it still required
liquid He (expensive, as in "a Dewar full of liquid money"; also an increasingly rare,
non-renewable resource).  

### Recent History: The Holy Grail  

The Holy Grail was to get a superconductor with $T_c \ge 77\ K$, which is the boiling
point of liquid nitrogen.  LN2 is much, much cheaper to make (and renewable from, you
know, _air_), so it's much to be preferred over liquid He.  If the transition temperature
is comfortably higher than 77 K, then you can cool it down to 77 K with LN2 and then pump
up the current &amp; magnetic field.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-tradeoffs.jpg" width="400" height="245" alt="Bussmann-Holder &amp; Keller @ Zeit fur Naturforsch: Tradeoffs between current density, magnetic field, and temperature for low- and high-temperature superconductors" title="Bussmann-Holder &amp; Keller @ Zeit fur Naturforsch: Tradeoffs between current density, magnetic field, and temperature for low- and high-temperature superconductors" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
There's a really, _really_ annoying constraint in superconductors: you can push either the
temperature, the current, or the magnetic field, but not all 3.  Sometimes not even any 2,
as indicated schematically here by Figure 12 from a recent lightly-technical review by
Bussmann-Holder &amp; Keller.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> If you try anyway, the
superconductor quenches back to normal, and all the energy in the magnetic field (which
scales like $B^2$!) is released.  

("All the energy released" is a very polite euphemism describing the explosion of a small
to medium sized bomb.  Bad idea.  Trust me: I won't tell you now I know that, but I _do_
know exactly how bad an idea that is, failing to respect the energy density in a gnarly
magnet.)  

In the mid-1980s, people began looking at cuprate ceramics.  Ceramics are brittle, and
thus make miserable wires.  As I recall
[Eric Drexler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Eric_Drexler) saying at the time, "If you hand
people something that looks like a wire, the first thing they'll try to do is wind it into
a coil."  Ceramics were not really suitable for that.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-cuprates.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-cuprates-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="308" alt="Bussmann-Holder &amp; Keller @ Zeit fur Naturforsch: Tc vs time, especially for cuprates" title="Bussmann-Holder &amp; Keller @ Zeit fur Naturforsch: Tc vs time, especially for cuprates" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
But&hellip; one thing led to another and in 1987 Wu, _et al._ came up with an
yttrium-barium-copper-oxide preparation with $T_c \gt 93\ \mbox{K}$.
<sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  That's when the race started, as shown in this plot,
also from Bussmann-Holder &amp; Keller.  __NB:__ the near-vertical red line is the cuprate
series, climbing _very_ quickly starting in the late 1980s.  

They all have some similarities: the copper oxides form layers, with other stuff
sandwiched inbetween.  Something about this is important.  While we have a comprehensive
theory of the mechanism of ordinary superconductivity (BCS theory, in 1957), we don't have
universal agreement on the high-$T_c$ sector.  People have their favorites, for example
the authors of today's paper, _q.v._, favor something called 1-dimensional BR-BCS.  

Back in the 80s, theoretical work on this was _wild._  People proposed
[anyons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anyon) (particles that are neither bosons nor
fermions because their 2-dimensional pseudoparticles and the spin-statistics theorem
doesn't quite fit), antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations, interlayer couplings, and so on.
There's still no universally (or even widely) accepted answer.  

But, this all became practical.  The superconducting magnets used in 
[the tokamaks being built](https://cfs.energy/technology/#sparc-fusion-energy-demonstration)
by [Commonwealth Fusion Systems](https://cfs.energy/) are
[REBCO](https://cfs.energy/technology/#hts-magnets-enabling-technology)
(rare-earth barium copper oxide, the rare
earth here being yttrium).  Yttrium is problematic, as it's hard to find (hence "rare").
Much of rare earth production is sourced from China, which instantly brings in political,
trade, and potentially military problems that nobody wants.  

CFS's REBCO magnets have a _demonstrated_ 20 T field strength and run a current of 40.47 kA, both
quite impressive.  Though the material has $T_c \sim 90\ K$, they will run at much lower
temperatures (~ 20 K, if I recall correctly) to get some running
room in critical field and critical current (see above).  

So they still need liquid He for cooling.  And we'll see below why the new superconductors
might not help, at least not initially (low critical current and low critical field).
Perhaps later materials will be better.  


### Room Temperature (But Not Pressure)  

Other people have found near-room-temperature superconductors, but in each case the
transition required very high pressures that make them fascinating physics but never a
likely engineering choice.  (Except, of course, in science fiction stories about beings
living at high pressures.  Say, in the core of Jupiter under its crushing atmosphere.)  

For example, in 2015 some hydrates of H${}_2$S reached a nicely high $T_c \sim 203\ K$,
but only at 15,500 atmospheres. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> 
This is easily achievable in the lab, even with a hand-cranked diamond anvil pressure cell.  But
it's not going to happen for a power transmission line!  

But that set off the search for other things that might superconduct at high temperatures,
just at less insane pressures.  Earlier this year a nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride showed
a transition temperature of $T_c \sim 294\ K$ ("room" temperature is ~300 K)&hellip;
but only at 10,000 atmospheres. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  (Also: Lutetium&hellip;
really?  Ick.)  

Better (higher temperature & lower pressure), but not _enough_ better to matter.  

Still: it set off some interest in high-pressure materials, either by shrinkage from cold
or by brute-force pressure.

Enough background!  

Today's papers causing all the excitement are a pair of preprints that dropped on
_ar&chi;iv_ last weekend. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
They're from an overlapping group of Korean researchers at a couple Korean universities
and research institutes (and one peculiar small company).  Their funding appears to be
from various Korean research grants.  

The authors are Lee, Kim, and Kwon on the first paper, and Lee, Kim, another Kim, Im, and
Auh on the second.  There are so many authors on the second because they did X-ray
diffraction (XRD), crystallography, X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS), SQUID analysis,
electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and, for all I can tell, a colonoscopy
(because why not?).  If you're going to throw all that measurement tech at the problem
(and in this case you _should_), then lots of your colleagues who are experts at those
measurements will want on board. If anything, I'm surprised the author list is so _short._  

There's something important to remember, as we read through these very rough papers, with
spelling mistakes, misnumbered figures, oddly-drawn plots, mistakes with subscripts in
chemical formulae, and all that.  Namely: this is a very, very early report of a
potentially important result.  You should _expect_ a certain amount of
almost-but-not-quite amateurish stuff.  This is not because anybody's an amateur; it's
because they're _in a hurry._ So start off by respecting that, and cutting them some slack on
those kinds of issues.  

My very favorite illustrative issue of this sort is the following string, which occurs a
couple times in the 2nd paper:  

> 오류! 책갈피가 정의되어 있지 않습니다.,오류! 책갈피가 정의되어 있지 않습니다.  

According to Google Translate, confirmed by Korean colleagues who are too generous
with their time when I ask silly questions, this means:  

> error! Bookmark is not defined, Error! No bookmarks are defined.  

So apparently it's their bibliography software barfing on an unresolved link.  

Personally, I think it's charming and should be left in the final copy.  But that's just me. :-)

### Preparation of LK-99 and Some Properties  

The material in question starts from a Pb apatite called Lanarkite, which is then doped
with Cu atoms.  The final result is
$\mbox{Pb}\_{10 - x}\mbox{Cu}\_{x}(\mbox{PO}\_{4})\_{6}\mbox{O}$, for
$0.9 \le x \le 1.1$.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-synthesis.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-synthesis-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="290" alt="Kim, et al.: Synthesis of LK-99" title="Kim, et al.: Synthesis of LK-99" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The synthesis pipeline is shown in Fig 1a-i of the second paper, reproduced here.  
- Synthesize Lanarkite by crushing in a mortar an equimolar mixture of lead oxide and lead
  sulfate, then bake at 725&deg;C under $10^{-3}$ torr vacuum for 24hr:  

  $\mbox{PbO} + \mbox{PbSO}_4 \rightarrow \mbox{Pb}_2(\mbox{SO}_4)\mbox{O}$.  
  
  The sulfur will evaporate in the oven, so handle that.  The result is a white powder.  
- Prepare copper phosphide by mixing 3:1 molar ratios of Cu and P in a crucible
  (presumably carefully enough not to ignite the phosphorous, or under an oxygen-free
  atmosphere?).  Then bake at 550&deg;C for 48hr under $10^{-3}$ torr vacuum.  The
  reaction will be  

  $3\mbox{Cu} + \mbox{P} \rightarrow \mbox{Cu}_3 \mbox{P}$.  
- Mix the Lanarkite and copper phosphide in a crucible (what ratio?), and crush to
  powder.  Bake at 925&deg;C under $10^-3$ torr vacuum for 5-20hr.  They don't say
  exactly, but I expect the baking time will vary the amount $x$ of copper doping.  

Honestly, the pictures look like boring old charcoal.  But that just goes to show you how
deceiving visual inspection is.  

After all the XRD, XPS, EPR, SQUID (and probable colonoscopy), they conclude that their
material is "polycrystalline".  Given the way they just baked it, this is no surprise.  We
should expect some resistance showing up between crystal domains, but no particular
orientation sensitivity as the domains should be randomly oriented.  And indeed they
claim to see that, so there's progress to be made by growing larger crystals somewhat less
violently.  

The crystallography is consistent with a lead-apatite crystal structure, with copper doping
sites and a few $\mbox{Cu}_2\mbox{S}$ impurities.  However, the XRD data say the crystal
has been compressed in 2 dimensions, with cell lattice base vectors going from values in
lead apatite of:  

$$
\left\{
  \begin{align*}
    a &= 9.865 \ \mathring{\text{A}} \\
    b &= 7.431 \ \mathring{\text{A}}
  \end{align*}
\right.
$$

compressed, _very slightly_ by $0.003 - 0.022 \ \mathring{\text{A}}$, down to:  

$$
\left\{
  \begin{align*}
    a &= 9.843 \ \mathring{\text{A}} \\
    b &= 7.428 \ \mathring{\text{A}}
  \end{align*}
\right.
$$

It's not a lot, but it's enough to shrink the crystal volume by 0.48% by lead/copper
substitution.  This squeezing is apparently important: they have a theory that both cold
temperatures and high pressure have squeezed lattices in the past where superconductivity
is observed, so this is just a different way of building a squeezed crystal.  

Well, maybe&hellip; let's wait for experimental confirmation and then let the theorists weigh in
on that.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-xtal.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-xtal-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="408" alt="Lee, et al.: xtal structure of LK-99, implying squeezed xtal and SQW tunnelling" title="Lee, et al.: xtal structure of LK-99, implying squeezed xtal and SQW tunnelling" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
In the meantime, they have a theory that the cuprate layers threaded together by Pb/Cu
chains are part of the superconducting mechanism.  They propose superconducting quantum
wells (SQWs) in the cuprate layers, and that the squeezing effect makes it more likely for
electrons to tunnel to the next layer via the Pb chains.  

This is shown in Fig 3 of the second paper, reproduced here. I'm not competent to comment
other than it's an interesting alternative to conventional BCS.  ("Interesting, if true",
as [HL Mencken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken) is supposed to have answered
on the subject of UFOs.)  

__This, then, is the material they call LK-99.__  The 3 letters are the 3 (Latin alphabet) initials of
the surnames of the primary authors.  It may be this is their 99th attempt, or they may
just think 9's are cool.  I note with some trepidation that in the second paper, LK-99 is
now apparently trademarked, so the lawyers are _already_ here.  

Some thoughts:  
- Somebody described it as like a car windshield of tempered glass, i.e., with stress
  literally baked into the material.  
- It's a plausible material, in that it extends the cuprate high-$T_c$ trend, and is
  relatively easy to make in polycrystalline form.  
- But a more monocrystalline form may perform much better, though way more difficult to
  make?  
- The volume shrinkage due to Cu doping may indeed substitute for pressure in the other
  examples of room temperature high-$T_c$ materials.  
- Sometimes the ratios are a little unclear between the 2 papers.  Crystal structure and
  words claim 1:4 Cu:Pb, chemical formula is 1:9 (depending on $x$), and preparation is
  3:2.  Ok, this will _eventually_ get straightened out.  And optimized.  

The most interesting part is this is made of commonly available materials.  There are no
rare earths like yttrium.  We do not require "unobtainium", found only in the country of
Outer Explodistan with its notoriously touchy government of the Neo-Marxist-Friedmanite
Conservatives of the Old School Party.  Lead, sulfur, oxygen, phosphorous, and copper are
pretty widespread.  

On the other hand, lead!  Ick.  If the optimized version of LK-99 still has lead, we'll
need very stringent regulation, tracking every gram of lead going into a factory, the
superconductor coming out, and the waste.  And there will have to be heavy criminal
penalties for _not_ recycling the lead-containing superconductors at end-of-life.  I
suggest something like the Sarbanes-Oxley law in the US, where corporate high executives
are _personally liable_ and subject to _prison_ for violation.  

The last time we trusted large companies (leaded gasoline) it didn't work out at all well
for anybody. <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> (&larr; Read the footnote, Bunky!)  

__NB:__ The details of the recipe are _slightly_ different between the 2 papers.  The
first paper says $x < 1.0$, while the second says 1.1.  The second paper says the
Lanarkite synthesis should be done under $10^{-3}$ torr vacuum, the first does not.  This
is either because they're understandably fiddling with the recipe, or those parts were
written by 2 people with different grasps on the details.  

### 4 Boxes Ya Gotta Tick for Superconductors  

To even _start_ convincing people you have a superconductor, you have to show there is:
1. a critical temperature $T_c$ for the phase transition with zero resistivity below $T_c$,  
2. a critical current $I_c$ above which the sample "quenches" back to normal,  
3. a critical magnetic field $H_c$ above which it also quenches, and 
4. the sample excludes magnetic flux partially (Type II) or fully (Type I), called the
   Meissner effect.  
   
You have to do all 4 of those _before_ people will even _begin_ to take it seriously.
There's more after that, but that's the ante to get into the game.  So let's count their
chips!  

#### Critical Temperature $T_c$ and Zero Resistivity  

First, critical temperature and zero resistivity.  Consider, as shown here, Figures
1a&amp;b from the first paper:  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-p1-fig1-ab.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-p1-fig1-ab-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="165" alt="Lee, et al.: First paper, Fig 1a-b, Tc and zero resistivity" title="Lee, et al.: First paper, Fig 1a-b, Tc and zero resistivity" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Figure 1a shows what happened when: 
  - They applied a _fixed_ current across the sample, in both directions (+ and -) on the
    horizontal axis.  
  - The vertical axis is the measured voltage drop across the sample, presumably due to
    resistance.  
  - The colors encode various temperatures at which they did this.  
  (The "fixed applied current" sometimes throws people since they're used to thinking of
  applying a fixed voltage, not a fixed current power supply.)  
  
  Consider the black line, at 298 K.  There is 0 mV voltage drop across the sample, until
  the current reaches about 250 mA.  This demonstrates both 0 resistance below some
  critical temperature $T_c \lt 298$ K, which we'll get to below for critical current.  
  
  As you can see, the same holds true as the temperature rises, but the window of current
  the sample will sustain with 0 mV voltage drop narrows down as we get closer to the
  putative $T_c$.  
- Now consider Figure 1b.  Here, there are 2 plots, the outer one and the inset one.  
  - In the outer plot, they've zoomed in on the vertical axis by a factor of 1000, so
    we're looking not at mV but at &mu;V now.  The horizontal axis is zoomed in by a
    factor of 10, so we're looking at $\pm$ 30 mA instead of 300 mA.
  - In this zoomed-in view, most of the previous temperature samples are in the
    superconducting state.  We expect to see 0 &mu;V difference, and we pretty much do see
    that, with noise.  You can argue about the mean and standard deviation differing from
    0 &mu;V, but that can wait for a later precision experiment.  Crudely, the voltage
    across the sample at constant applied current is pretty much 0.  
  - In the inset plot, they've calculated resistivity.  Some of that involves sample size,
    which they did not report.  But the main point is that this will sooner or later
    involve calculating $V/I$ for various values in the outer plot.  
    - As long as you stay away from $I = 0$, the resistivity values are convincingly close
      to 0.  
    - When you get close to $I = 0$, all hell breaks loose.  You're essentially trying to
      calculate numerically $V/I = 0/0$, where the numerator and denominator have mean 0
      and some amount of noise.  The result should jump around randomly, and indeed it
      does.  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-p2-fig5.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-p2-fig5-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="304" alt="Lee, et al.: 2nd paper, Fig 5, resistivity vs temperature and complex multi-stage transition" title="Lee, et al.: 2nd paper, Fig 5, resistivity vs temperature and complex multi-stage transition" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Finally, consider Figure 5 from the second paper.  
  - The outer plot is the more traditional resistivity $\rho$ versus temperature $T$ plot.
    ("Traditional" means it goes all the way back to Kamerlingh-Onnes, up at the top of
    this post.)  Note that the horizontal coordinates are in &deg;C, not &deg;K!  
  - The inner plot is the derivative of conductivity ($\sigma = 1/\rho$) with respect to
    temperature.  This is proportional to something important called the _density of
    states_, i.e., the number of quantum states available to electrons at this
    temperature.  Since it counts quantum states, it appears prominently in statistical
    mechanics where you look for the most probably quantum states.  We'll ignore it for
    now, even though the underlying physics is interesting.  
  - The authors point out that the transition is a bit complicated:  
    - Around 40&deg;C something a little funky happens, with a bump of resistivity and the
      density of states doing _something_, but it then settles back down.  
    - Around 60&deg;C _something_ happens, where there is a very slow (but small) rise in
      resistivity.  
    - Around 90&deg;C _something else_ happens, and the resistivity flattens out, while
      the density of states goes nuts.  (Probably related phenomena?)  
    - Finally around 106&deg;C = 379&deg;K there is an abrupt rise in resistivity,
      indicating a transition to normal phase.  Then the resistivity rises linearly,
      consonant with a metal using the Pb 6s2 band.  (There's a whole song and dance in
      the literature about whether high-$T_c$ superconductors use s-wave or d-wave
      electrons.  Our authors today favor s-wave, for a variety of reasons in the paper
      which we'll gloss over here.)  

__Conclusion:__ For a transition temperature $T_c$ below which $\rho = 0$, they've got
pretty good evidence.  Not perfect, and a bit unusually presented, but good enough to
merit reproduction elsewhere.  

Minor nit: they should report current _density_ (current / unit cross-sectional area of
sample).  That's the crucial thing, not total current.  Still&hellip; enough to look

#### Critical Current $I_c$  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-p1-fig1-e.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-p1-fig1-e-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="333" alt="Lee, et al.: First paper, critical current vs temperature" title="Lee, et al.: First paper, critical current vs temperature" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
As you'll recall from the Bussmann-Holder & Keller plot above, there's a constraint
involving temperature, current, and magnetic field which bounds the superconducting
state.  We hinted at it above in Figure 1a of the first paper, but now let's really
consider their documentation for critical current $I_c$.  

Figure 1e of the first paper, reproduced here, has the goods for us.  They're showing that
as a function of temperature, there's a maximum current $I_c$ that you can put through the
sample.  

Up around the critical temperature $T_c = 400$ K, you can barely put any current
through it at all, maybe 10mA max.  But down around 300 K, you can put about 250 mA
through it.  

This is exactly what we would expect of a superconductor, at least qualitatively.  The
shape of the curve is pretty funny, but given the polycrystalline nature of the sample,
and probably multiple different isoforms in it or even impurities, this is not especially
daunting.  Perhaps a purer, more monocrystalline sample will look more as we expect?

__Conclusion:__ For at least a qualitative sense of little current near $T_c$ and a lot
more as you cool down, this makes pretty good evidence.  Again not perfect, but probably
the sample's not perfect either, given how it was made.  

Also note the critical current is _small:_ 250 mA at room temperature.  You're not gonna
transmit much power that way!  (Recall the CFS magnets run about 40 kA, so $O(10^7)$ times
more current.) Still&hellip; early days.  The material may be optimized more, or may be a
guide to discover better materials.  

It's a first step onto a big road.  

#### Critical Magnetic Field $H_c$  

As you'll _also_ recall from the Bussmann-Holder & Keller plot above, the constraint
involving temperature, current, and magnetic field bounding the superconducting
state implies a critical magnetic field $H_c$.  Apply too much magnetic field, and the
superconducting state shatters in your hand like a glass Christmas bauble, and goes
normal.

</table>
The evidence for that is shown in Figures 1c&amp;f in the first paper.  
- Figure 1c shows the by now familiar $V$ _vs_ $I$ plot at some fixed unreported
  temperature, but now for various magnetic fields.  
  - Note they've measured magnetic field in Oersteds, where 1 Tesla = 10,000 Oersteds.  So
    the highest field considered here is 0.3 T, i.e., not terribly much by modern
    standards.  (Recall the CFS fusion magnets are 20 T, so $O(10^2)$ more magnetic field.)  
  - As you can see, at low magnetic fields (0.0 to 0.2 T) the range of applied current
    which keeps you in the superconducting state is around 250 mA in either direction.  
  - But as you pack in the magnetic field, that comes down to maybe 50 mA either way.  
  - This is what we expect to see.  
- Figure 1f shows the same thing, in a different (more conventional) representation.  
  - It shows the relation between the critical current $I_c$ and the critical magnetic field
    $H_c$.  
  - As long as you stay in the lower left, you can be superconducting.  If you cross into
    the upper right, you quench to the normal state (usually catastrophically).  
  - Again, the exact shape of the curve is debatable, and not quite what I'd expect.  But
    that can wait for confirmation and purer samples.  

__Conclusion:__ There is reasonable evidence for a critical magnetic field $H_c$.  Some
details look a little hinky, but at this stage with an early sample fabrication process,
you'd expect that.  

#### Meissner Effect: Flux Exclusion  

Finally, the big guy: the Meissner effect.  

Superconductors either partially (Type II) or fully (Type I) expel magnetic flux.  So if
you take a superconductor and put it in a magnetic field, it'll repel that field, i.e., a
strong diamagnetic effect.

Do we see that here?  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-p2-fig4.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-p2-fig4-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="471" alt="Lee, et al.: Second paper, Figure 4 on Meissner effect" title="Lee, et al.: Second paper, Figure 4 on Meissner effect" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The evidence is in Figure 4 of the second paper, reproduced here.  
- Figure 4a is a bit complicated.  It shows what happens when you cool a sample in the
  normal state, with and without magnetic field, down below the superconducting transition
  temperature.  
  - In the normal state, samples allow magnetic field to penetrate them.  They have a
    [_magnetic susceptibility_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_susceptibility)
    (diamagnetic if $\chi \lt 0$, where the dipoles in the material align against the
    external magnetic field).  
  - So when you cool them, the sample that initially contained a field will continue to do
    so, whereas the sample that did _not_ contain a field will resist acquiring one.
    That's what we see here, with $\chi \sim -3.6$ emu/g for the field-cooled sample but 
    $\chi \sim -5.3$ emu/g for the zero-field-cooled sample.  
- Figure 4b shows us this in a bit more graphic fashion.  If you take a superconducting
  sample and put it on a big pole of a magnet, it will float.  Here we see the sample
  partially floating, apparently because it's big &amp; heavy and the sample is not quite
  pure.  But we can tell it's room temperature &amp; pressure because of the human hand in
  the background; never seen _that_ before, given people's understandable reluctance to put their
  hands in liquid helium!

  There's a video of this available at
  [ScienceCast/_ar&chi;iv_ Video](https://sciencecast.org/casts/suc384jly50n).  Apologies
  for not being able to download or embed it, as would have been the case with YouTube!
  However, someone else had that same thought, and what's shown here appears to be the
  same video, though labeled in Korean.  The (automated?) voice-over is in English.

  This isn't perfect:  
  - They could have used a smaller sample that would have levitated; the dragging is a
    major sticking point here.  
  - They clearly have samples of different purities (see curves in Figure 4a above).  Is
    this one of the higher or lower purities?  
  - Some other materials will also float, like certain paramagnetic forms of graphite.  
  - Maybe pan the camera around so we can see the magnet details better; if it's a single
    pole of a single magnet, this becomes more convincing!  

__Conclusion:__ I have a little bit of trepidation here, given that I only slightly
understand the diamagnetic susceptibility argument in Figure 4a and the floating alleged to
be the Meissner effect does not look perfect.  So let's score them a "low pass" on this
one: partially convincing, but good enough to be worth looking at in another lab for
reproduction.  

### Stuff That Looks a Bit Suspicious  

Various people have proposed a number of things that look a _little_ bit off, though
nothing appears to be a showstopper.  Here's my (rebuttable) summary of some of those
opinions:  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-heat-states-function-temperature-superconductor-transition-T.jpg" width="200" height="283" alt="Britannica: Heat capacity vs temperature to deterimine normal/sc phase transition" title="Britannica: Heat capacity vs temperature to deterimine normal/sc phase transition" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
- Normally one measures the transition temperature with something called the Debye
  temperature, found on a plot of heat capacity vs temperature to find the phase
  transition, as shown in this image from _Encyc Britannica._  LKK claim that they
  shouldn't do this because the usual (BCS) theories of superconductivity don't apply to
  their SQW-tunneling-squeezed case.  This is&hellip; a little bit suspect.  
  
  They should measure it anyway, and let theorists explain the difference.  
  
  But they're experimentalists thrashing about for a theory, which often doesn't end
  well.  They just supply the recipe and the experimental results; others will reproduce
  the results (or not).  _Then_ theorists will start weighing in about mechanism.  So LKK
  are trying to solve a problem they don't have here &ndash; just measure the heat
  capacity vs temperature empirically and be done with it!  
- They invoke the BR-BCS theory, instead of the conventional BCS, and invoke an analogy
  to Josephson junctions to explain their SQW tunneling.  Others claim that BR-BCS
  doesn't apply here; I'm not competent to have an opinion but note the disagreement.  
   
  Again, this is experimentalists trying to invoke theory at too early a stage.  Just
  show us the evidence, make us reproduce it, and the theorists will figure something out
  with you.  This is not LKK's problem, but they go on about it at length, anyway.  
- Someone else &ndash; alas, I forget who! &ndash; doesn't believe the magnetic
  susceptibility curves in Figure 4a above.  There's some kind of scaling problem where he
  thought a perfectly diamagnetic superconductor should have diamagnetism of -1, whereas
  this implies -154.  
  
  Well, that's serious.  But I'm not competent (any more, alas) to find the discrepancy,
  let alone resolve it.  Maybe somebody else can?  

### Problems With Superconducting Properties  

So it really looks like a superconductor, modulo a few wrinkles, on all 4 aspects checked
above.  But before you start dreaming about super-magnets and lossless transmission lines,
consider:  
- __Low critical field:__ $H_c \sim 0.3$ T, which is pretty low.  The superconductor is
  "magnetically fragile" in that it  goes normal in very moderate fields.  Recall that the
  CFS tokamak magents, which are nitrogen-temperature (and lower) superconductors, run at
  20 T.  So you're not making any big magnets with this material.  
- __Low critical current:__ $I_c \sim 250$ mA at 0 magnetic field.  The superconductor is
  "current fragile" in that it goes normal at very moderate currents.  Recall that the CFS
  tokamak magnets run at about 40 kA.  So you're not making any high-current applications,
  such as transmission lines, with this material.  
- __Not ductile enough:__ It looks more like brittle charcoal than anything else; you're
  not going to form wires, let alone wind those wires into coils.  
  
All of these are dismissible with the argument that this is the _first try_ at finding a
room-temperature, ambient pressure superconductor!  Let's just verify by reproduction at
another lab that it _works_, then theorists will figure something out about mechanism, and
we can proceed with optimization of the structure to be ductile, high-current, high-field,
&hellip; and as wonderful as we imagine.  

For example, the hypothesis of (a) squeeze cuprate layers that induce superconducting
quantum wells and (b) layer-to-layer quantum tunnelling between layers along the lead (or
other metal?!) vertical "rails" might be a good guideline.  


## Reproduction in Other Labs  

Lest you think anybody's dragging their feet, attempts to reproduce this result fly on
apace.  One group, amusingly named "MeissnerOrBust", is livestreaming on Twitch, according
to Sabine (who somehow &ndash; charmingly &ndash; seems to know everybody):  

<a href="https://twitter.com/skdh/status/1684917544103116800"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-hoss-2.jpg" width="550" height="374" alt="Sabine Hossenfelder @ Twitter: Livestreaming high-Tc sc reproduction (check 9:40pm Pacific time)" title="Sabine Hossenfelder @ Twitter: Livestreaming high-Tc sc reproduction (check 9:40pm Pacific time)" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

So we'll see pretty soon! 2023-Jul-28 9:40pm US Pacific time is 2023-Jul-29 12:40am US
Eastern Time.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Whew!  That was intense.  

Some bottom-line thoughts:  
- The material is $\mbox{Pb}\_{10 - x}\mbox{Cu}\_{x}(\mbox{PO}\_{4})\_{6}\mbox{O}$, for
  $0.9 \le x \le 1.1$, and there is a reasonably (not perfectly) specified recipe for
  making it.  
- What's the optimal values of $x$?  "Optimal" in terms of $T_c$, $I_c$, and $H_c$
  tradeoff.  
- The oven method makes charcoal-ish polycrystaline stuff; can we do better with annealing
  the crystal domains, or something to remove inter-domain resistance as a problem?  
- Oh, please, please, please: can we reproduce this with another metal besides Pb, so we
  don't have to deal with the regulatory issues around toxicity?  A _common_ metal, not
  some exotic rare earth only available in Outer Explodistan, etc.?  
- Can we make it ductile, to make something like a wire that we could wind into something
  like a coil?  
  
  I mean, no criticism of LKK here.  Good job discovering it at all.  Enjoy your Nobel Prize.  But
  charcoal is not wire, so there's something for the next folks to do!  

Even if we can't make wires or coils, if we can add it to chips via molecular epitaxy or
some such thing, we might be able to make superconducting quantum computing devices at
room temperature.  (Raw thought; I have explored _literally no detail_ there.)  

__Conclusion:__ There are some problems, both of presentation and somewhat odd ways of
showing the 4 points of superconductivity.  But they all look more like rhetorical
problems, not real physics problems.  It's _very much_ worth the time of other labs to try
to reproduce this!

Anybody wanna stay up &amp; watch the video on Twitch reported above?  Email me!  


## Addendum 2023-Jul-29: Life Gets Weird  

Ok, now things are strange, which is how you know the story is real.

I tuned in to the livestream advertised above.  Up until about 11:00pm EDT, it was a video
of their oven with a countdown timer, and lots of peculiar spectators shooting strange
emojis at each other in large quantity.  Still&hellip; _de gustibus,_ and all that.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hmpf.png" width="400" height="160" alt="Hmpf." title="Hmpf." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
I fell asleep, and woke up at 11:52pm EDIT, 12 minutes after the advertised start time.
The channel was offline.  Others had taken 30sec snaps showing the material being removed
from the oven, then nothing.  

Hmpf.  

A couple others have claimed replication failure, but I have reservations.  Overnight this
went down:  
- One was in Indian group who explicitly did not follow the preparation recipe, but tried something
  else (incorrect heating sequence, also probably got Cu doping wrong).  Not really sure
  how that's "replication".   
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-nonsense.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-nonsense-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="187" alt="Alleged Japanese non-confirmation, really nonsense" title="Alleged Japanese non-confirmation, really nonsense" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- Another was a press release only in Japanese text in an image shown here, with an alleged English
  translation.  But the actual Japanese text just nonsense:  

  > On Sundays I eat roast chicken, sausage and pepperoni potatoes. LK99 I love ham &
  > cheese lasagna, but it's got high calories. Unless I eat junk food every week I gain
  > excess calories and the chance of the diet getting delayed is 0%.  

  Thanks, that was certainly&hellip; helpful.  
- There was a similar fake non-replication "result" in Chinese, but with no names, no
  institutions, no procedural details, etc.  

Well that's weird.  

In the meantime, somebody's claiming the alleged problem with the magnetic susceptibility
above was a graphical cut-and-paste error, which will be corrected.  Ok, good, glad to
hear it.  Would prefer _seeing_ it.

But then things got _really_ weird: apparently there's a schism among the authors.  

1. Lee, the lead author, and a representative of Korea University gave interviews saying
   Kwon resigned or has been fired from both KU and the Q-Centre months ago, and published
   the first (3-author) paper without permission of the others, from reconstructed data.  
   <a href="https://twitter.com/alexkaplan0/status/1684935072481214465"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-lee-vs-kwon-1.jpg" width="550" height="313" alt="Lee &amp; Korea University: Kwon out, uploaded 3-author paper w/o permission" title="Lee &amp; Korea University: Kwon out, uploaded 3-author paper w/o permission" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
2. At the time of this interview, Kwon was actually presenting the results at a symposium,
   affiliating himself with both KU and Q-Centre!  He also didn't put the 2 main PI's on
   the project on his title slide at all, which is usually a career-limiting move.  
   <a href="https://twitter.com/alexkaplan0/status/1684936637061414913"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-lee-vs-kwon-2.jpg" width="550" height="746" alt="Kwon presenting LK-99 results @ MML symposium" title="Kwon presenting LK-99 results @ MML symposium" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
3. Lee says the 3-author paper posted by Kwon is retracted, and his 6-author paper
   without Kwon is the official one.  But&hellip; Kwon apparently _is_ on the patent they filed.  
   <a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1685294623449874432"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-07-28-high-tc-sc-lee-vs-kwon-3.jpg" width="550" height="1397" alt="Kwon 'goes rogue', Lee retracts his paper" title="Kwon 'goes rogue', Lee retracts his paper" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
   
Something has gone really weird here.  And no in the "good/interesting/fun" weird way.  In
the _bad_ weird way.  At least 1 person here is being a very bad actor, though at this
point I can't tell who that might be.  

I'm gonna pay less attention to the drama, and more to the _real_ replication attempts.
Argonne is supposed to be on deck in a week or so.  Maybe then we'll know.
