## Conviction Day

Previously we've celebrated on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR) Trump's
Indictment Day and Arraignment Day, in various courts.  Today we hit a new milestone: in
Trump's trial for fraudulently covering up hush money payments to a porn star as a
fraudulently ignored campaign contribution and election interference, he was found guilty
on all 34 counts.  

Details are still coming out.  No idea yet when sentencing will happen, whether it will
include prison time (especially for the blatant lack of remorse, 10+ incidents of criminal
contempt, threats to the court staff, their families, and witnesses), and whether he will
be allowed to remain free pending his inevitable appeal.  


## The Weekend Conclusion

It's hard to keep in mind how _long_ this has been going on.  The _Doonesbury_ cartoon
shown here ran on 2017-Oct-22, but has a flashback to Mark having the same feelings vs
Nixon's criminality on 1973-May-29.  

_This comic ran 7 years ago._  

It's taken forever for justice to grow a spine, and we may hope upon sentencing that it
will stick.  

While I'm tempted to _schadenfreude_, this is nonetheless a sad day.  We are beginning to
excise this tumor on the American body politic, but it's sad we let it get this far.  Our
real test will be whether the Republicans in the US accept the verdict, as they should.  

We look forward to Sentencing Day, when we hope for imprisonment, as this CLBTNR's closing
remark has said for some time now:  [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)

Nope.
