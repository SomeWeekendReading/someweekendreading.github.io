Today I learned the commercial names of the COVID-19 vaccines.  One of them is a real
winner!  


## On the naming of cats&hellip;

No, this is not about TS Eliot's poem on 
["The Naming of Cats"](https://poets.org/poem/naming-cats).  If it were, every drug
would have a secret name which only the drug itself would know.  


## Drug names  

Instead, it's about the absurd US system of naming drugs.  Each drug has several names:  

- __Chemical Name:__ A name derived from chemical nomenclature, sometimes a real jawbreaker
  that takes many lines to write down and is essentially unpronounceable. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> 
  I won't even _begin_ to think what the name of a complex mRNA drug with a lipid
  nanocapsule would be.  Just&hellip; "complicated".  
- __Compound ID:__ A name given by the companies developing them, often called a "compound
  id".  Sometimes they even _change_ the compound id, just to obfuscate and confuse the
  business intelligence gatering efforts of competitors.  
  - The Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is called BNT162b2 or PF-07302048, or sometimes
    both separated by a slash, depending on whether you want the BioNTech or Pfizer id.
    (Though why you should care, unless you work in one of those companies, is unclear.)  
  - The Moderna vaccine is called mRNA-1273.  See how clever they are with names?  
    - The company's main business is mRNA therapeutics, so the company works in "Mode
      RNA".  
    - The vaccine compound id often uses an abbreviation of the company's name, which in this
      case is of course "mRNA".  
  - The J&amp;J vaccine is JNC-78436735. 
  - The AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine is&hellip; nothing I particularly care about.  
- __Generic Name:__ In the US, the FDA assigns a name that is deliberately not
  copyrighted, so anybody can use it.  They're generally sort of neutral sounding,
  designed so that it's hard to mis-hear them and mistake them for another medication.
  One drug I worked on, a proteasome inhibitor for use in certain blood cancers, got
  called ["bortezomib"](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Bortezomib) because it
  was a boronate compound inhibiting the proteasome.  Nice.  (Before that, it
  had compound ids PS-341, LDP-341, and MLN-341 as it changed owners.)  
  - The Pfizer vaccine is designated "tozinameran", for no particularly obvious reason.  I
    guess it doesn't sound like anything else, at least.  
  - Similarly cryptically, the Moderna vaccine is known as "elasomeran", a name beloved of
    nobody.  
  - The J&amp;J vaccine is known as Ad26.COV2.S, which sort of makes sense given that it
    uses an adenovirus known as Ad26 for its vector.  
- __Trade Name:__ Companies being the capitalist entities that they are, they of course
  want a name they control with copyright, and that they can forbid anyone else from
  using.  Usually they hire name consultants, who get out big books of Latin and Greek
  roots from which they construct candidate names.  Most of them are abominations.  Some
  of them are sort of ok: bortezomib is trade-named "Velcade" (high-velocity induction of
  apoptosis cascade, or something silly like that).

We've [speculated in the past about names for COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/moderna-vaccine-passes-vrbpac-review/#fn2), 
here on this crummy little blog that nobody reads.  But nobody listens to me about naming
things, usually for good reason.  

So Pfizer and Moderna have hired the relevant naming consultants, labored mightily, and
given birth to&hellip; what?  

Pfizer has embraced "Comernaty", which sounds like someone with a _really_ bad accent
trying to say "community".  I'm gonna go out on a limb here and give it a thumbs down.  

Moderna, on the other hand&hellip; these guys are _good._  Given that it uses the viral
spike protein to vaccinate you, they've called it...

> __SPIKEVAX!__  

That's just&hellip; brilliant!  

Hence our celebratory pictures of [Spike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer)) and a [VAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAX).  

Now I want a Moderna booster, even though I got Pfizer originally.

<a id="fn1">1</a>: I once had the rare good fortune back in the late 1990's to do some consulting for [CAS](https://www.cas.org) (Chemical Abstracts Services).  They were using an AI technique called an expert system to derive starndardized names from chemical structures.  I had to move that program to a then-more-modern expert system tool.  Very interesting and nice people. [↩](#fn1a)
