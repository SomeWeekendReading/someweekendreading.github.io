Adam Ragusea's cooking channel on YouTube has a post on uranium glass.  And
_how to build a cloud chamber in your kitchen._  


## A Cooking Channel&hellip; By A Really Smart Guy  

Adam Ragusea runs a YouTube cooking channel that I rather like.  He explains _why_ recipes
are the way they are in a way that appeals to my little neurodivergent left-brain
scientist's way.  

For instance, he made an instructional video telling you how to make _demi glace_ with much, much, less
work than the classic recipe: a low sodium chicken broth reduction with a few _umami_
boosters and unflavored gelatin.  It really, really works!

Today he put up a nice video on the early 20th century American fad for uranium-infused
glass.  It's kinda pretty, glows strongly under ultraviolet (and a little bit under
sunlight), and so on.  It was a fad because automation and mechanical molds made it cheap
to manufacture.  

But&hellip; people are always paranoid about radiation.  There's pretty much no danger
here since the uranium is safely embedded in the glass, and _you're not eating the glass._  

But the best part: he _built a cloud chamber in his kitchen_ so you can watch &alpha;
particle tracks!  (They're almost all natural background.)  He used a fish tank, some
adhesive, a paper towel soaked in 90% isopropyl alcohol, some dry ice, and a pot of hot
water.  

Absolutely first class!

I never built a cloud chamber in my kitchen, just some _demi glace._  

But it was a _good_ version of _demi glace._  

At least I thought so.

Nope.
