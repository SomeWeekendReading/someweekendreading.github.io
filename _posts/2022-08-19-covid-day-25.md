So&hellip; 25 days into the COVID-19 journey.  Is it over yet?  


## Thinking negative thoughts  

So here we are, 25 days from my first positive test, then paxlovid and an unfortunate
rebound.  The Weekend Editrix tested consistently negative (including PCR at a
professional lab!) but felt lousy, and was eventually declared positive by her doctor.
We're both past paxlovid, and recovering.

But are we negative?  

Behold the tests on the right.  The top one is the Weekend Editrix, and the bottom one is
the Weekend Editor.  Both are negative.  In her case, we're not sure what that means since
she's more or less always negative despite being actually positive.  But in my case, we're
pretty sure it means I'm negative.  

In fact,
[last December we worked through the Bayesian math]({{ site.baseurl }}/weekend-editrix-exposed/):
in possession of a single negative test each, we're now 89.4% sure that we're both COVID-19 negative.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

So yeah, it's more or less over.  Only "more or less", since we're both mildly symptomatic
(coughs, weak as kittens, and absolutely falling-down tired by mid-afternoon).  That will
apparently take several more weeks to clear.  But it looks like we're at the end of it,
providing COVID-19 has not left any long-term damage.  

Still makes me mad as hell at
[the MBTA's incompetently slow shuttle busses and the huge crowd of shouty, unmasked young folk who crammed into that slow, unventilated shuttle bus with me]({{ site.baseurl }}/testing-positive/#the-evidence).
That cost me almost a month of my life, in recovering from the damage.  And it means I
have an even shorter fuse for people
who won't mask in public.  

But then, this _is_ the blog of a grumpy old retired scientist, after all.
