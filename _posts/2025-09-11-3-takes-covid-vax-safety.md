[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags#SomebodyAskedMe) about safety data for this
fall's COVID-19 booster vaccinations.  _Again._  


## General Matters  

You might recall that it's been a custom on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads
(CLBTNR) that we live-blog the FDA VRBPAC advisory sessions on COVID-19 vaccines.  We did
not do that starting this year, since we have little tolerance for the Trump/Kennedy
willful disregard of science.  You can see here <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> why we
felt the need to disengage from the venomous nonsense.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-fda-1.jpg" width="400" height="135" alt="FDA Staff: strains for 2025-2026 will be JN.1 lineage, 'preferably' the LP.8.1 strain" title="FDA Staff: strains for 2025-2026 will be JN.1 lineage, 'preferably' the LP.8.1 strain" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Still, let the record show that the FDA VRBPAC met on 2025-May-22, and recommended a monovalent
booster based on the JN.1 lineage, preferably LP.8.1 (though I think Novavax can be JN.1,
since they're a protein vaccine and can't pivot fast) <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>:  

> Based on the totality of the evidence, FDA has advised the manufacturers of the approved COVID-19 vaccines that to more closely match currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses, the COVID-19 vaccines for use in the United States beginning in fall 2025 should be __monovalent JN.1-lineage-based COVID-19 vaccines (2025-2026 Formula), preferentially using the LP.8.1 strain.__  

That's&hellip; ok, I guess?  

But it's not great: we're still, as always, several variant strains behind reality.  The virus
mutates faster than our systems can respond, especially now with all the right-wing
foot-dragging and imposition of nonsensical constraints.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-wisc-1.jpg" width="400" height="176" alt="Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene: SARS-COV2 wastewater metagenomics" title="Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene: SARS-COV2 wastewater metagenomics" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
For example, let's consider the wastewater genomics of SARS-CoV2 collected over the years
by the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  First a
couple of terms:  
- _Metagenomics_ is when you do gene sequencing on something other than cells, to see what
  _all_ the things living there are.  For example, this has been done on seawater and
  revealed a host of bacterial and viral beasties that were poorly understood.  
- _Wastewater metagenomics_ is when you do this at a sewage processing plant.  Actually,
  all sorts of analyses are done on sewage, because of its startling honesty: everybody
  who uses a toilet contributes.  You can tell a lot about cocaine use, for example, by
  looking for the by-products.  Doing metagenomics, specifically focused on the SARS-CoV2
  genome, is a way to tell which strains are in circulation with a _very_ high level of
  honesty not relying on anybody reporting anything.  (Unless use of a toilet constitutes
  "reporting", in which case I really don't want to hear about your theory of "reporting".)  
  
This has been a big deal for some time with COVID-19; we've been writing enthusiastically
about it in this CLBTNR for some years now.
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>
<sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup> 
<sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup> <sup id="fn9a">[[9]](#fn9)</sup>
So let's see what our colleagues in Wisconsin have to say about it, with their state-wide
sewage monitoring.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-wisc-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-wisc-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="159" alt="WI Lab Hygiene: Proportion of SARS-CoV2 variants over time" title="WI Lab Hygiene: Proportion of SARS-CoV2 variants over time" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
First, consider the barplots of viral strain proportions over time, as shown here.  (Click
to embiggen, or use the references below, or [this link](https://dataportal.slh.wisc.edu/sc2-ww-dashboard#proportion), to consult the original.)  
- The horizontal axis is time, biweekly for about 3.5 years.  
- The vertical axis is the proportion of sequences seen for each viral variant.  
- Each column of colored bars is a stacked bar chart, showing you the proportion of
  sequences seen in sewage for a given variant, over that 2-week period.  
- The color legend is on the right, but here it only shows the top variants for the most
  recent period.  Of course you can go to the reference below for all the details.  
  
Now, note a few things carefully about the right most bar for 2025-Aug-11, the latest data:  
- _Everything_ of consequence in an Omicron substrain now.  The rest of the variants are
  practically extinct.  That is, the virus has so optimized itself for infecting us, that
  it's down to just 1 specialist variant, Omicron.  But there are _lots_ of subvariants!  
- The dominant subvariant right now is XFG (purple).  __NB:__ In the variant naming
  convention, names beginning with "X" are _recombinant_, i.e., fusions of more than 1
  other variant.  
- The variants recommended by the FDA are LP.8.1 and its superclass JN.1.
  - LP.8.1 is the green one, number 3 in the color legend.  It's very tiny, near the
    bottom of the bar.  
  - JN.1 is the orange one, in 12th place in the color legend.  It's way down at the
    bottom.  
	
Initially, this looks pretty discouraging: we're about to get jabs (you _are_, aren't
you?) with a booster for a strain that's completely a minority player, not the big bad
XFG.  

But&hellip; look a bit back in time (bars further to the left).  I know it's hard to read
here, but it's clearer in the interactive version on the Wisconsin web site: the 7th bar
from the right corresponds to 2025-May-19.  The long green bars there mean that the LP.8.1
strain _was dominant then,_ so the decision to pick that strain _was reasonable then._  

But really, the question we'd like answered is whether the vaccine strains JN.1/LP.8.1 are
still (somehow!) a reasonable choice _now,_ when all the action is from XFG?  

For that, we consult the phylogenetic tree of SARS-CoV2 viral variants (constructed from
NextStrain clades and PANGO lineage information).  If you don't know what that is, think
of it as an evolutionary family tree of the virus.  Two strains that are very close in the
tree (number of links to travel between them) are actually very close in their genetics,
and a vaccine for one will likely give coverage for the other.  ("Likely": sequence
similarity isn't everything, e.g., if there's a single black magic mutation dramatially
increasing infectiousness.  But all else being equal, sequence similarity is a good
measure.)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-wisc-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-wisc-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="382" alt="WI Lab Hygiene: SARS-CoV2 phylogenetic tree" title="WI Lab Hygiene: SARS-CoV2 phylogenetic tree" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Here's the tree constructed by our friends in Wisconsin (click to embiggen, or use
[this link](https://dataportal.slh.wisc.edu/sc2-ww-dashboard#:~:text=Phylogenetic%20relationships%20of%20Nextstrain%20SARS%2DCoV%2D2%20clades.) or the references to consult the original).  

Have a look at the upper right:  
- Go to the upper right corner, then back off to the left 4 levels.  You should be looking
  at a node labeled 24A (JN.1).  That's the root strain recommended for vaccines this fall.  
- An immediate descendant of that, to the right one level and just a skosh down, is 25A
  (LP.8.1).  That's the recommended target for vaccines this fall.  
- Directly below 25A (LP.8.1) is 25C (XFG).  _That's the dominant strain right now!_  

So the dominant strain right now is a direct descendant of the JN.1 lineage, and an
immediate sibling of the LP.8.1 lineage.  A vaccine for either of those should still
provide excellent coverage against XFG, all else being equal (no "evil miracle"
mutations).  

__Conclusion:__ _Get this booster._  Yes, our institutions are sclerotic, have always been
too slow, and are now wildly corrupted with malign actors.  However, the surviving FDA
&amp; CDC scientists last May got the VRBPAC committee to recommend something which should
serve us well.  

So that's the vaccine that's here to deal with.  Its _efficacy_ looks like a pretty good
shot on target for this winter.  But what about its _safety?_  

COVID-19 vaccines, _especially the mRNA vaccines_ from Pfizer &amp; Moderna, have been
proven safe and effective beyond a reasonable doubt.  Still, people are just _twitchy_
about them.  Given the amount of disinformation, ignorance and willful lying for political
purposes that we live in now, I guess this is understandable.  

So once again on this CLBTNR, we'll take a look at the data.  Today we go through 3 takes
on the safety of the vaccines: 2 very good, and 1&hellip; less so.  


## Take 1: _All_ of Denmark, 1 Month After Vaccination  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-jama-1.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="Andersson, et al. @ JAMA Network Open: Safety of JN.1 mRNA vaccines" title="Andersson, et al. @ JAMA Network Open: Safety of JN.1 mRNA vaccines" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Recall that our upcoming boosters are for LP.8.1, a direct descendant of JN.1.  That means
safety data about a JN.1 vaccine is quite relevant now.  

Fortunately, Andersson and colleagues have published just such a safety
study <sup id="fn10a">[[10]](#fn10)</sup> using essentially _all_ the available electronic
medical records in Denmark.  (This is one of the benefits of universal health care: the
universal medical records enable huge datasets that can explore hypotheses in much more
scientific detail!)  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-jama-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-jama-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="272" alt="Andersson, et al. @ JAMA Network Open: Study cohort characteristics" title="Andersson, et al. @ JAMA Network Open: Study cohort characteristics" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
First, let's have a look at their study cohort, shown here (click to embiggen):  
- Note the size: 1.5 _million_ subjects, 1 _million_ vaccinated and 0.5 _million_
  unvaccinated.  
  - That's not the _entire_ population of Denmark
    ([around 6 million in a 2025-Jul-01 estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Denmark#Population)),
    but it's probably everybody who had any contact with the medical system in the study
    period 2024-2025.  
  - This is a _very big_ study, essential impossible to replicate in the US with its
    fragmented, expensive health care with multiple incompatible electronic medical
    records systems and sometimes vicious insurance gate-keeping to avoid medical
    treatment.  
- Since they selected those aged &ge; 65 or with higher risks, the population skews a bit
  older.  We should expect to see more "old people problems" than in a general
  population.  
  - Indeed, the most frequent co-morbidity was "chronic cardiac disorder".  
  -  It also skews a bit female, which is to be expected given male/female life expectancy
     differences.  
- It looks like, in the vaccinated population, there were about 86% included because of
  age, and 13% included because of risks.  So it's _mostly_ a study of Danish seniors.  

The paper's a little unclear to me on this subject, but what it _appears_ they did was
ignore the unvaccinated population, and compare 29 different risks in the vaccinated
population.  The comparison was 28 days after vaccination vs the rest of the study
period.  So they're looking for fairly prompt, acute reactions to the vaccine in the month
immediately following.  

They then computed, for each type of event, an _incident risk ratio._  It basically
amounts to computing the ratio of  the risk rate per day in the time 28 days after the
vaccination.  A ratio &lt; 1 indicates _less_ risk in the post-vaccination month; a ratio
&gt; 1 indicates _more_.  A ratio near 1, especially with a 95% confidence interval
straddling 1, means there's no significant difference.  

There are multiple ways to compute the confidence interval here:  
- The [Clopper-Pearson method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Clopper%E2%80%93Pearson_interval) for binomial proportion confidence intervals,  
- Our own unpublished and mostly untested, but theoretically pleasing,
  [method of Gauss hypergeometric functions for ratios of Beta-distributed variables](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/beta-ratios/), and  
- [Poisson regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression).  

They chose the last method, Poisson regression, to get them an event count and confidence
intervals to fold into the ratio to get a ratio confidence interval.  

I could check their work with either of the other 2 methods, but have not done so and will
not unless (somehow?) there's demand.  A quick spot check, dividing the mean events per
100k person-years in both groups gives an estimate close to the mean value they've
plotted.  So it looks honest, at least from a reasonable distance.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-jama-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-jama-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="253" alt="Andersson, et al. @ JAMA Network Open: Adjusted incident risk ratios for 29 days after vaccination vs rest of study period" title="Andersson, et al. @ JAMA Network Open: Adjusted incident risk ratios for 29 days after vaccination vs rest of study period" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Have a look at the [forest plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_plot) on the right
of this figure.  
- Each row is one of the 29 events they checked for, based on observation of what happened
  before in vaccinated populations, and what happens to older populations in general.
  There's no insinuation that vaccines _cause_ any of this, just that these things happen,
  particularly to older people, so they checked the incidence rates.  
- In most cases, the mean of the ratio is &lt; 1, meaning the risk is lower immediately
  following vaccination.  
- However, take a closer look at the error bars.  
  - In _almost every case,_ the error bar spans a ratios &lt; 1 to ratios &gt; 1.  That
    means in those cases there is _no statistically significant evidence_ to point to any
    difference in the event rates immediately after vaccination vs otherwise.  
  - In _only a few cases,_ the ratio is &lt; 1 and the 95% confidence interval is also
    bounded below 1.  This means there is evidence that you're _safer_ from that risk in
    the month following vaccination&hellip; though judging by the ratio, not by much.  
	
__Conclusion:__ For the 29 risk factors relevant to this cohort, there's no evidence that
risks immediately following vaccination are any different from other times.  Vaccines 
_do not increase_ any risks immediately following their administration.  


### A Mathematical Digression: Poisson Regression &amp; Adjusted Incidence Rate Ratios  

It occurred to me that for most people it's not obvious why Poisson regression is a useful
tool for calculating adjusted Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs).  So let's fix that!  (The
[Wikipedia page on Poisson regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression)
is a good starting point.)  

Poisson regression tries to predict a count of events $Y$ (e.g., number of medical adverse
events) from a vector of features $\mathbf{x}$ (e.g., age, vaccination status, risk
status).  Predicting the log mean of $Y$ conditional on $\mathbf{x}$ with regression
coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$:  

$$
\log(\mathbb{E}[Y \vert \mathbf{x}]) = \alpha + \beta' \mathbf{x}
$$

This would fit your observed values of $Y$, but adjust them a bit so they make sense 
_as groups_ with the covariates $\mathbf{x}$.

Now if you want to compare 2 groups, with observed counts $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ with group
covariates $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ (say, vaccinated and unvaccinated people
within the same age cohort), then you'd use the regression model like this:  

$$
\left\{
  \begin{align*}
     \log(\mathbb{E}[Y_1 \vert \mathbf{x}_1]) &= \alpha + \beta' \mathbf{x}_1 \\
     \log(\mathbb{E}[Y_2 \vert \mathbf{x}_2]) &= \alpha + \beta' \mathbf{x}_2
  \end{align*}
\right.
$$

Take the difference, and you get a log estimator (almost) for the ratio:  

$$
\log\left(\frac{\mathbb{E}[Y_1 \vert \mathbf{x}_1]}{\mathbb{E}[Y_2 \vert \mathbf{x}_2]}\right) = \beta' (\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2)
$$

So this plus the uncertainty estimates on $\beta$ from the regression get you an estimator
on the ratio and 95% confidence limits.  

A couple caveats:  
- Yes, this depends on the coding levels for $\mathbf{x}$.  But if you have 2 groups, say
  vaccinated and unvaccinated, coded as 0 and 1, then $\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2 = 1$,
  conveniently enough.  
- Yes, the ratio of the expectation values is not the expectation of the ratio.  Ratio
  statistics is a whole 'nother thing.  See, for example, our method on a
  [method of Gauss hypergeometric functions for ratios of Beta-distributed variables](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/beta-ratios/)
  to get some idea how hairy that gets.  The Poisson method used here is apparently good
  enough, often enough, that it's widely used.  
- The variables being predicted are not actually counts, but _rates_.  That is, there's
  some kind of normalization done for each covariate group, e.g., divide by the number of
  fully vaccinated 18-44 year olds to get an incidence rate, say, per 100k person-years.
  That
  [mildly complicates things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_regression#%22Exposure%22_and_offset),
  but is intellectually straightforward.  

In the end you get (almost) an estimator for the incidence rate ratio, adjusted for the
covariates, and a 95% confidence interval on it.  

(I'd have done it differently using my method of ratio statistics on Beta-distributed even
probabilities, but I admit that's a niche taste.)  


## Take 2: _All_ of Norway, 3 Years After Vaccination  

So that's the boring, safe story for no risk increase in the short term.  

What about longer term?  

We _definitely_ see increased all-cause mortality rates at the onset of the pandemic.
Were these due to the vaccines, or due to COVID-19 itself (and its disruption of health
care in general)?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-medrxiv-1.jpg" width="400" height="254" alt="Dahl, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: mRNA vaccination all-cause mortality in Norway" title="Dahl, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: mRNA vaccination all-cause mortality in Norway" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
For that, we turn to a 3-year study by Dahl, _et al._ <sup id="fn11a">[[11]](#fn11)</sup>,
who looked at all-cause mortality in a similarly broad population in Norway (universal
health care!), over 2021-2023.  

Note that this is a preprint, which is not as yet peer-reviewed.  So&hellip; grain of
salt.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-medrxiv-1-tbl1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-medrxiv-1-tbl1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="371" alt="Dahl, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: Characteristics of study cohort" title="Dahl, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: Characteristics of study cohort" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
First, let's look at their study cohort, the summary table of which is shown here.  
- It was a retrospective cohort study, including just about everybody over age 18 living
  in Norway in the years 2021-2023.  
  - They were able to mine real-time national health registry data to obtain a study
    cohort of 4,645,910 people.
  - The 2024 population of Norway is around 5.5 million, so this was nearly the entire
    country in 2021-2023.  
  - Subjects were categorized as unvaccinated, partially vaccinated (1 or 2 doses), and fully
    vaccinated (3+ doses).  
    - People changed vaccination groups upon receiving a new dose.  This was reported in
      real time by the national electronic medical records system.  
	- These are obviously not the JN.1/LP.8.1 vaccines of this year, but rather the mRNA
      vaccines first available in 2021 and their modified versions through 2023.  
	- If you want to study long-term effects, you have to look long term, which means
      including older treatments like the very first mRNA vaccines.  Yes, mRNA vaccines
      have been in use for long enough that we can look at the first versions as having
      been "in the old days" of 2021!  
- Death outcomes were from the National Population Register.  

Now let's consider their calculations.  They stratified by analyzing each age group
separately.  Within each age group, they performed Poisson regressions to adjust for
covariates like gender, place of residence, and by whether they were in a high-risk
group.  

These Poisson regressions yielded an adjusted incidence rate ratio of all-cause mortality,
for each vaccination group compared to the unvaccinated. This looks almost exactly like
the method of the previous paper, except that instead of measuring 29 adverse events for a
few months, they measured only all-causes mortality _for 3 years._  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-medrxiv-1-fig1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-medrxiv-1-fig1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="271" alt="Dahl, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: Adjusted incidence rate ratios show LOWER all-cause mortality in all cases" title="Dahl, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: Adjusted incidence rate ratios show LOWER all-cause mortality in all cases" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The results are shown here, in a forest plot.  
- There are 4 groups, each in a horizontal strip. The most important one is the top strip,
  which represents all 3 years combined.   
- Within each such group, they first stratify by vaccination status (unvaccinated,
  partial, and full) and then by age group (18-44, 45-64, and 65+).  
- __NB:__ Since the unvaccinated group is the baseline for comparison, the ratio for them
  is always exactly 1.  We're interested in whether the vaccinated groups show a ratio
  less than 1 (fewer deaths) or greater than 1 (more deaths).  

Note that the adjusted IRR is _always_ less than 1, and is in fact bounded below 1 by its
95% confidence interval!  Also note that in the 3-year combined dataset, the 95%
confidence intervals are _very_ tight: a consequence of having 4.6 million test subjects!
Universal health care is good for health care, but it's also _great_ for research.  

(You might be curious about the one weird apparent exception for fully vaccinated, age
18-44, in 2021 only: the 95% confidence interval crosses 1.  If you look at the number of
deaths in that vax group and age group for that year, there were only 13!  Basically this
group was _so well protected from dying that there were too few deaths_ to estimate
accurately the 95% confidence interval!  That was a _very_ safe time to be a fully
vaccinated young Norwegian.)  

__Conclusion:__ The vaccinated population had a _lower_ death rate from all causes.  


## Take 3: _Some_ of Florida, For 1 Year Early in the Pandemic  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-medrxiv-2.jpg" width="400" height="347" alt="Levi, _et al._ @ medR&chi;iv: mRNA vaccination all-cause mortality in Florida" title="Levi, _et al._ @ medR&chi;iv: mRNA vaccination all-cause mortality in Florida" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Levi, _et al._ report a different result (for a slightly different question) using data
from Florida in the US.  <sup id="fn12a">[[12]](#fn12)</sup>  

Note that this is _also_ a preprint, which is not as yet peer-reviewed.  So&hellip; grain of
salt.  

I'm not quite sure _what_ to day about this one!  It _appears_ to be an attempt to use
Florida data on Pfizer vs Moderna vaccination and match with vital statistics, to see if
there's an increase in all-cause mortality with one vaccine _compared to the other vaccine._  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-medrxiv-2-fig1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-09-11-3-takes-covid-vax-safety-medrxiv-2-fig1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="297" alt="Levi, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: KM curves for various outcomes by choice of vaccine" title="Levi, et al. @ medR&chi;iv: KM curves for various outcomes by choice of vaccine" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
The data, in outline:  
- Matched cohort of 1,962,822 adults.  
- Participants got a first dose of Pfizer or Moderna between 2020-Dec-18 and 2021-Aug-31.  
- Outcomes sought were all-cause mortality, COVID-19 mortality, and cardiovascular.  
- They claim a very peculiar result, that there was increased mortality with Pfizer
  compared to Moderna, as shown by the KM curves here.  

As for their statistical methods: in 56 pages, there is not a single equation.  There are
big walls of descriptive word salad, and I understand some people like that.  But it's
hard to say exactly what they did, without diving deeper than I care to do.  
- There are a number of Kaplan-Meier survival curves, stratified by vaccine, for various
  populations.  But&hellip;  
  - There's no mention of, say, a logrank $p$-value to assess whether the curves are
    statistically significantly different.  
  - There's no mention of a Cox regression that would normally be done here, to account
    for censorship.  
    -  There is some mention of logistic regression (death or not) on various predictors,
       much like the Poisson regressions used above to get adjusted incidence rate
       ratios.  
    - There is no discussion of why logistic regression vs Poisson regression vs Cox
      regression, or the like.  I mean, I _love_ logistic regression, but from what I
      understand of the word salad it may not be the correct tool here.  
- The data made me pretty uneasy:  
  - Florida isn't exactly famous for having reliable data like this.  And the famous
    conservative slogan about dying "with COVID-19" vs "of COVID-19" means they're
    depending on a judgment made by unknown persons with unknown agendas.  
  - They exclude cases of suicide and murder, treating them separately as "negative
    controls".  I don't like this: "all-cause mortality" should mean _all_ causes.
    Suicidal depression or murderously poor impulse control &amp; aggression seem like
    things worthy of inclusion.  
  - Unlike the Norway & Denmark studies above, where vaccination as near-universal, in the
    US and in Florida in particular this was more of an iffy decision, depending on the
    person's exposure to misinformation.  
  - By choosing vaccination dates of 2020-Dec-18 and 2021-Aug-31, they're looking only at
    people who were vaccinated _very early in the pandemic._  That population skews older
    and with more co-morbidities; we vaccinated them earlier because they needed the
    protection.  (We denizens of Ch&acirc;teau Weekend are among them.  Ok, not the cats,
    but the rest of us.)  

I _did_ like the fact that they started out with about 12 million records, and pared it
down to about 950k in each arm, after careful matching of cohort properties.  That part
looks to be well done, but again there are no statistical details or equations for the
cohort matching.  

But why hasn't anybody else seen this, and made a very, _very_ loud noise about it?  If
their conclusion is true, why did the Norwegian data above show long-term protective
effects against all-cause mortality?  And why did the Danish data above show protective
effects against 29 separate adverse events in the short term?  Why has no
pharmacovigilance study shown Pfizer inferior to Moderna?  

If I were a referee, I'd stop the paper here and demand (a) explanations of why the
dataset is not biased, (b) a clearer explanation of their statistical methods (including
$p$-values attached to the KM curves), and (c) a meta-analysis including _someone else's data_,
showing that the effect is real.  

But honestly, the thing that _really_ made me twitchy was that one of the authors is
Joseph Ladapo, currently surgeon general.  Absent some _really_ compelling argument to the
contrary, he just looks _problematic_ to me.  The senior health reporter at the popular
science venue _Ars Technica_ has been writing negatively about him for years:

- As we [worried previously, on this CLBTNR]({{ site.baseurl }}/best-rfkjr-headline/#its-not-just-rfkjr),
  this is the guy who (a) wants to ban all mandatory school vaccinations, and (b) 
  _compared vaccine mandates to slavery_ <sup id="fn13a">[[13]](#fn13)</sup>:

- Back in 2022, he did a "dubious analysis" of Florida data and ended up recommending
  _against_ mRNA vaccines for men ages 18-39. <sup id="fn14a">[[14]](#fn14)</sup>  The
  study was posted on the Florida Dept of Health web site, but without their logo, and
  without any authors.  The critical review was not kind:

  > "comically bad." Some called the analysis method "terrible," and one epidemiologist
  > called it "the absolute most batshit study design & analysis plan I have ever seen."

- Shortly after that in 2023, he was accused of fraud. <sup id="fn15a">[[15]](#fn15)</sup>

  The investigation was closed, since the tipster did not want to be publicly exposed.
  However, there is evidence that the study authors &ndash; whoever they may be &ndash;
  deliberately avoided emailing about the project, passing notes to each other instead.
  This kept them off the official government records.  
  
  Attempting to _conceal your work_ is never a good sign in science.

- Later in 2023, as he continued to allege "crimes" in the vaccines, against masking, and
  promoting nonsense treatment like ivermectin, he tried to get the FDA and CDC on his 
  side. <sup id="fn16a">[[16]](#fn16)</sup>  
  
  (Recall this was 2023, when the FDA and CDC were still science-run organizations.)  
  
  Their response was blistering:  
  
  > In a four-page letter dated March 10, FDA Commissioner Robert Califf and CDC Director
  > Rochelle Walensky easily debunk his inaccuracies, falsehoods, and bluster, while
  > taking the opportunity to point out that he is failing the people of Florida in his

  > &hellip;

It's a paper with a startling conclusion, but which just presents many problems before I can
believe it.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

1. The fall 2025 vaccine, optimized for LP.8.1, is very likely to be effective against
   the dominant variant, XFG.  XFG is a recombinant (hence name starting with X) sibling of
   LP.8.1.  
2. There is no acute short-term risk in the month after vaccination, compared to the rest
   of the time.  
3. There is no increased mortality from vaccination, in fact dramatically the opposite as
   shown by the Norway data.  (Levi, _et al._ will disagree about Pfizer _vs_ Moderna, but
   I am _extremely_ uneasy with their data and with one of the co-authors.)  

__Bottom line:__ Get the COVID-19 booster this fall, and get a flu shot while you're there.
