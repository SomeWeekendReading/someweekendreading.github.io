Yesterday came simultaneous bits of evidence in the US that (a) COVID-19 death rates for
unvaccinated are unambiguously disastrous, and (b) Republicans attempted to defund any
school that takes COVID-19 protections.  This is 'death cult' levels of badness.  


## Death rates by vax status  

Yesterday [Eric Topol](https://drerictopol.com/) pointed to a result from the CDC's data
tracker on COVID-19 death rates by vax status <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    All ages 18+, US update for vaccination and booster protection from death during Omicron wave<br>
    2-shot vaccination 85% reduction of death<br>
    3-shot (w/booster) 96% reduction of death

Now, in case that's too small to read on your screen:  
- the black curve is unvaccinated
- the dashed light blue curve is vaccinated but not boosted,
- the solid dark blue curve is vaccinated and boosted.  

The blunt-trauma-obvious conclusion is that death rates among the unvaccinated are
dramatically larger.  If you read the fine print in the legend in the lower left, you can
pretty quickly find the actual numbers of deaths per 100,000 for vaxed &amp; boosted vs unvaxxed:  

$$
\mbox{Risk Ratio} = \frac{12.06}{0.45} = 26.8
$$

That is, if you're unvaccinated, you're at almost _27 times the death risk_ of the vaxed and
boosted.  

True, you can tease out some subtleties by stratifying by age, obesity status, and other
risk factors.  (We've even [done that here before]({{ site.baseurl }}/covid-simpson/) on
this crummy little blog that nobody reads.) But you can't eliminate a 27-fold increase in
risk with subtleties!   

__Conclusion:__ Get vaccinated and boosted, use masks, social distance and you'll probably
live through this.  Don't do that, and your chances of dying go up double digits.  


## Republican policy reactions  

You might think that this sort of thing would cause a unified push to vaccinate and save
the lives of people.  Not so, as reported 2 days ago by CSPAN Capitol Hill reporter 
[Craig Caplan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-caplan-405679/):  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    44-49: Senate defeats Cruz (R-TX) amendment to end federal funding to schools and
    child care centers that enforce COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

Basically:  
- The public health data says we should get vaxed, boosted, masked, and distanced to
  minimize the loss of life.  
- Republicans, particuarly Sen Cruz, propose to defund any school which does that, thereby
  using federal funding as a bludgeon to _maximize misery and death._  
  
Note that voting for this proposal was nearly unanimous among Republicans, with the
exceptions of Blunt and Collins (and, apparently, a couple others who judiciously chose to be
out of town).  

__Conclusion:__ Republicans aren't just advocating bad policy any more.  They're
explicitly advocating policy that causes avoidable deaths.  

Now, sure, it's Ted Cruz.  It's a well-known axiom that he's disliked even by his own
side.  Al Franken (then senator, D-MI) is supposed to have said of Cruz:  

> Here's the thing you have to understand about Ted Cruz: I like Ted Cruz more than most
> of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz.  And I hate Ted Cruz.  

If this had been proposed by another Republican senator slightly less disliked, and you
know there are 49 other Republican senators each crazy enough to try, then this might have
passed.  (Probably to be blocked in the House or by the President, but still: it's a
statement of intent from the right. They want political points, and are willing to accept
deaths in order to get them.  This is the
[bargain of Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), the
ultimate coordination problem.)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Look, I grew up in a family that had been Republican since the time there _were_
Republicans.  But about the time or Reagan, Republicans gradually got crazy, and I got
out.  Now the crazy isn't so gradual any more.  

__Conclusion:__ Once you figure out you're in a death cult, the correct next move is to
_get out._  

There's more after that, but start by getting out of the Republican party.
