In Latin, "corvus" means crow.  So the adjectival form used in biology is "corvid".
Sometimes people get confused in interesting ways.  


## On crows  

The wags of [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) have a subreddit for the 
[discussion of crows](https://www.reddit.com/r/crows/)&hellip;  because _of course_ they
do.  This is a world in which everything must happen at least once, so here we are.  

Latin pedantry being what it is, the denizens are of course aware that a crow is in general called
a corvid.  So, what does one say when confronted with a picture of 18 crows?

!["Waiting for Corvid 19"]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-04-30-corvid-19-well-actually-18.jpg "Waiting for Corvid 19")

Of course, one opines that they are waiting for Corvid #19.  


## Yeah, that's it  

I know: it's pedantic, but I'm a pedant; it's a "dad joke", but I'm an old dude;
it's&hellip; well, what it is.  That's all I got.  

So sorry.
