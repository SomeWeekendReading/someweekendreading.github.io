Trump is facing a gag order in his NY trial, on the basis that he has previously
threatened judges, clerks, attorneys, witnesses and jurors &ndash; including death
threats.  While this is obviously true, do we have objective evidence that this is the
case?  Why, yes: yes, we do.  


## Doomscrolling: A Bad Habit  

A confession: I have a bad habit of doomscrolling.  

(Yeah, I know: Long COVID-19 brain fog, then depression, and now doomscrolling.  Somebody
fix the world for me, please?)  

Some of it is "technical" doomscrolling, where I fantasize that I can keep up with physics
and statistics at the level I practiced before retirement.  This is an impossible
standard, and it is not good for me to hold myself to it.  

But much of it is "doom" doomscrolling, looking at the polycrisis where it seems
_everything_ is falling apart.  We deny that COVID-19 is still here, democracy is
crumbling before _stupid_ fascists, the deep ignorance of the US population is astounding
(as in: they don't know who the likely presidential candidates will be), abortion bans
actually force doctors to be complicit in the murder of women in need of medical care,
congressional Republicans conspire with Russian intelligence to sabotage US government
with shutdowns and cutoffs of Ukraine weapons aid, and so on.  This is also bad for me,
though it still sticks in my head that it is the duty of a responsible citizen to be
at least _somewhat_ informed about these matters.  

But most of all, I watch the agonizingly glacial slowness of the Trump trials.  I want _so badly_
for this guy to be in prison forever, disqualified from politics, and his followers
utterly disillusioned with, and ashamed of, their fascist turn.  Yes, this is
_schadenfreude_.  Yes, it is not a good look.  No, I cannot resist.  

In particular, I tend to watch the YouTube highlights of the previous night's news
programs on MSNBC: Stephanie Ruhle, Lawrence O'Donnell, Jen Psaki, Rachel Maddow, Joy Reid, Ari
Melber, Joe Scarborough/Mika Brzezinski, and others.  


## About That Gag Order&hellip;  

<iframe width="400" height="224" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cf_Z1KTX2hQ?si=m5Mt8tibHQCRbKDv&amp;start=300" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>

Today's case in point came up in Lawrence O'Donnell's "Last Word", about 5 minutes into
the "highlights" (the video to the right should start there).  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

It seems that in Trump's latest criminal trial, NY District Attorney Alvin Bragg has filed
notice of a motion to request that Trump be gagged, i.e., prohibited from talking about
the trial or the people involved, for the duration of the trial.  This is because Trump has
a clear and persistent record of threatening judges, their clerks, attorneys, and jurors.
This results in death threats, people moving to secret places, and having to hire
bodyguards.  

O'Donnell's talking about an affidavit near the end of a recent court filing, which we'll get to
[below](#the-evidence-statistical-significance--strength-of-effect). But first, let's have
a trawl through the rest of the filing.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-27-trump-danger-test-filing.jpg" width="400" height="494" alt="NY DA Alvin Bragg: Notice of intent to file motion for protective gag order" title="NY DA Alvin Bragg: Notice of intent to file motion for protective gag order" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Bragg's filing <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> makes for interesting, if voluminous (331
pages!), reading.  The gist, of course, is simple (__emphasis__ in the original):  

> __Defendant has a long history of publicly attacking individuals involved in legal
> proceedings against him, including witnesses, jurors, judges, and prosecutors; and
> those attacks are often followed by harassment, intimidation, and threats.__ (p 4)  

> __Defendantâ€™s history of attacks create a reasonable likelihood of witness intimidation,
> juror interference, and harassment of other participants in this criminal proceeding.__ (p 22)  

He then provides ample, even damning, evidence that Trump's spray of bile leads to his
followers making credible attempts at _murder_.  

That's the first 35 pages.  

There follow about 300 pages of exhibits, showing Trump's social media posts, speeches,
and books full of inflammatory statements from which follower violence _predictably_
erupts.  It's the predictability that matters: Trump can't claim he couldn't predict what other
people would do; he spoke out _because_ he knew they would use violence on his behalf!  

There are veritable pleas from a dozen or so jurors in other Trump cases not to release
their personal details, because they and their families fear for their lives.  Included
are chilling images of the hand-scrawled, semi-illiterate death threats.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-27-trump-danger-test-threat-engoron-voicemail.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-27-trump-danger-test-threat-engoron-voicemail-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="418" alt="Example of obscene, racist, anti-Semitic threats left on Judge Engoron's chambers telephone" title="Example of obscene, racist, anti-Semitic threats left on Judge Engoron's chambers telephone" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-27-trump-danger-test-threat-example.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-27-trump-danger-test-threat-example-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="256" alt="Example of specific murder threat against DA Alvin Bragg" title="Example of specific murder threat against DA Alvin Bragg" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
There are also amazingly crude threats left on Judge Engoron's phone, showcasing the
foul-mouthed anti-Semitism, sexism, racism, homophobia and general insanity of today's
Republicans (see image here, one example from many on pp. 260-261).  Other threats are
specific, actionable, promises of murder even down to the choice of weapons and preference
for a head shot (see image here, one example from many on pp. 270ff).  There are _many_
such examples.  

No less chillingly, but more amusingly, we can see relevant extracts from Trump's books
(exhibit 11, pp. 304ff).  (Side note: some poor schlub in the DA's office drew the
assignment of _reading_ this sewage.)  A few bits that justify gagging Trump for the
duration of the trial:  

> When somebody hurts you, just go after them as viciously and as violently as you can.
> Like it says in the Bible, and eye for an eye.  (p. 308, excerpted from __Trump: How to
> Get Rich__)  

> I love getting even when I get screwed by someone &ndash; yes, it is true, people still
> try to take me for a ride, and sometimes they succeed, rarely, but when they do I go
> after them.  (p. 315, excerpted from __Think Big__)  

To any sane person, this should be enough: numerous threats to maim, torture and murder
along with Trump's stated policy of encouragement of this.  It's happened so many times
&ndash; apparently in the low hundreds of times, documented here &ndash; that Trump simply
cannot blame this on others.  He knows what he's doing, and has written that this is how
he operates.  

Either you gag him, or gag orders are meaningless and can never be used again.  


## The Evidence: Statistical Significance &amp; Strength of Effect

Yes, to any normal person that should be more than enough.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-27-trump-danger-test-affidavit.jpg" width="400" height="513" alt="Pastilli affidavit: rate of threats against DA, pre-Trump vs post-Trump" title="Pastilli affidavit: rate of threats against DA, pre-Trump vs post-Trump" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
But then we come to exhibit 13 (pp. 316 - 321) <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, and it
contains some hard data that is quite a doozy, statistically speaking.  It's only 5 pages,
but&hellip; _boy_ is it worth reading.  

This is an affidavit by Nicholas Pistilli, a Sergeant in the NYPD, who is the commanding
officer of the security detail ("Threats and Protection Unit", or TAPU) for DA Alvin
Bragg.  

He has&hellip; _thoughts._  In particular, he has _numbers_, and there's no better way to
get nerdly attention than quantifiable stuff like this.  He tells us in 2022 (pre-Trump)
and 2023 (with Trump) the number of threats his group processed, and the number of those
that were against the DA, his employees, or his family.  

After 2023-March, the volume went up so much they had to ask for help from outside the
unit protecting the DA.   Also, the severity went up enough that in just the 3 weeks after
2023-Mar-20, they had to open several threat cases (basically referral for prosecution).  

So, of course, we wrote an [R](http://www.r-project.org/) script to analyze
it! <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  

### The Numbers and Estimates of DA Threat Frequency  

Here's what we found from his affidavit, giving the frequencies of threats in 2022
(pre-Trump) and 2023 (after Trump proceedings began).  He tells us the total number of
threats, and the number of threats _specifically_ against the DA, his employees, and their
families. 

We've marshalled his report into a table; for now just concentrate on the first 3 columns:  

```
Year NThreats NDAThreats pDAThreat MedpDAThreat LCLpDAThreat UCLpDAThreat
2022      483          1    0.0021       0.0035       0.0005       0.0115
2023      577         89    0.1542       0.1550       0.1271       0.1860
```

Note that the total threats go up by about a quarter (483 to 577), and that the
DA-specific threats go up a _lot_ (1 to 89).  We can get a rough measure of the
probability that a given threat will be made against the DA by:

$$
\mbox{pDAThreat} = \mbox{NDAThreats} / \mbox{NThreats}
$$

We see in column 4 that this measure went from 0.21% before Trump to 15.5% after Trump, a
very, very sharp increase by a factor of about 73 times!  

### Bayesian Posterior Estimates of the Distribution of DA Threat Probability  

We can also, briefly, think like a Bayesian.  Start by considering the probability $p$
that a given threat is specific to the DA.  Well, that's a random variable, so we can ask
how it's distributed.  
- _Before_ seeing any data (a "prior"), we choose a 
  [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_uniform_distribution),
  i.e., we're indifferent and think $p$ could be anything in $[0, 1]$.  
- _After_ seeing some data (a "posterior"), we find from
  [Bayes Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) that $p$ should be
  distributed according to a [Beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution), 
  with parameters calculable from the counts (number of threats, number of those that
  are DA-specific) by some trivial arithmetic:  $ p \sim B(k + 1, N - k +1)$.
  
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-27-trump-danger-test.png"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2024-02-27-trump-danger-test-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="Uniform prior, posterior Beta distributions for probability that a threat is a DA threat" title="Uniform prior, posterior Beta distributions for probability that a threat is a DA threat" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Those distributions are shown here.  (Columns 5-7 of the table above report the median and
the 95% credibility intervals, as discussed here and shown on the plot.)  

- The blue curve shows what we should think about $\Pr(p)$ pre-Trump.  

  The 1 case in 483 threats gives us a pretty low value, as shown by the blue curve saying
  most of the evidence indicates a low probability near 0.  In fact, the posterior median estimate
  is $p \sim 0.4\%$, with a 95% credibility interval/confidence limit of 0.1% &ndash; 1.1%.  

  That is, we're 95% sure the true value of the probability that a threat is directed at
  the DA is somewhere between 0.1% and 1.1%.  

- Now consider the red curve, which covers the Trump period, i.e., $\Pr(p)$ post-Trump.
  It's centered on a much higher value.  
  
  In fact, the posterior median is $p \sim 15.5\%$, with a 95% CL of 12.7% &ndash; 18.6%.

This is clear visual evidence that the probability a threat is directed against the DA
went up, and dramatically, after Trump was indicted and inflaming his followers.

### Frequentist Analysis: Statistical Significance Testing &amp; Strength of Effect  

The relevant test here is a test of proportion, whether the 1/483 is different from the
89/577 in the pre-Trump and post-Trump years.  The null hypothesis here is that the
proportions are equal; our choice of alternate hypothesis was that the pre-Trump rate was
lower.  

The data rejects the null hypothesis, i.e., this is excellent evidence that the Trump era
included more DA-specific threats:

```
	2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction

data:  threatData$NDAThreats out of threatData$NThreats
X-squared = 76.416, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16
alternative hypothesis: less
95 percent confidence interval:
 -1.0000000 -0.1253086
sample estimates:
     prop 1      prop 2 
0.002070393 0.154246101 
```

The reported $p$-value of $2.2 \times 10^{-16}$ is just the smallest the R user interface
will report without embarrassment.  If you dig inside the test report, the actual value is 
$1.1 \times 10^{-18}$.  

Either way, this is _ridiculously_ statistically significant: the effect is real, and
there is no doubt that the DA threats went up after Trump came along.  

Statistical significance tells us whether an effect is _real_, and it is.  But to see
whether it went up by a little or a lot, we need a parallel strength of effect analysis.
For that, we resort to the [Cohen's $h$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_h)
statistic, which is the relevant strength of effect measure for proportions.

```
Cohen's h |       95% CI
------------------------
0.72      | [0.60, 0.84]
```

The interpretive rule here is that $h \sim 0.2$ is a small effect, $h \sim 0.5$ is a
medium effect, and $h \sim 0.8$ is a large effect.  At 0.72, we're either a very solid
medium effect size, or just on the verge of a large effect size.

The effect is both real (statistically significant) and rather large.

## The Weekend Conclusion  

There's extensive, and damning, evidence of threats of kidnapping, torture, and murder
against judges, clerks, attornesy, and jurors.

The numbers show unequivocally and objectively that the rate of DA-specific threats went
up dramatically.  The difference statistically significant, i.e., real.  Objective effect
size statistics also show that it is a pretty large effect.

Trump should be gagged.  

[_Cetero censeo_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ceterum_censeo), Trump should be
