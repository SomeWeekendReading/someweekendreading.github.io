It's Memorial Day in the US again.  This happens every year, but lately it seems we are
absolutely determined to learn nothing from it.  

## The Sitch

This was supposed to post 2025-May-26, which is Memorial Day in the US.  But here we are 3
days later, because my feelings about this 'holiday' are both _strong_ and _complicated!_  

As all 6 of you who follow this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), Memorial
Day stirs up some mixed emotions in me.  

My general attitude toward war memorials <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> is that they
should make us ashamed that humanity is driven to that kind of thing.  Sure, we can be
glad about a victory, or proud of a response to a bad situation&hellip; but the situation
causing the war was still _bad._  So, like fellow physicist Chad Orzel shown here, we
should be thinking about how not to let wars happen again.

I also can't help but remember that Memorial Day itself has a complex origin, involving not
just North/South tensions after the Civil War, but White Southerners attempting to eradicate a
rather sweet Southern Black post-war tradition <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> involving 
cleaning Union graves, singing hymns, praying, and picnicking.  

So here we are, with a US government that is most definitely _The Bad Guys,_ and not much
hope of reprieve until we might flip Congress in 2027. It is _extremely_ difficult to feel
patriotic when our government is so thoroughly dishonorable, stupid, and destructive.  

See?  Sad and conflicted.  


## The Ideal

On the one hand, my general sense of appropriate memorials, as always, stems from 
William E Stafford's poem, "At the Un-National Monument along the Canadian 
Border" <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>.  

An essential extract from the poem conveys the sense of the whole:  

> This is the field where the battle did not happen,  
> where the unknown soldier did not die.  
> This is the field where grass joined hands,  
> where no monument stands,  
> and the only heroic thing is the sky.  
>  
> Birds fly here without any sound,  
> unfolding their wings across the open.  
> No people killed &ndash; or were killed &ndash; on this ground  
> hallowed by neglect and an air so tame  
> that people celebrate it by forgetting its name.  

It is, if anything, a thought on _war_ memorials that emphasizes _peace._
[John Gorka](https://www.johngorka.com)'s <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> setting to
music, shown here, is&hellip; well, it often brings tears to my old eyes.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-30-memorial-day-2022-lost-horizon-2.jpg" width="400" height="559" alt="James Hilton: 'Lost Horizon', 1933" title="James Hilton: 'Lost Horizon', 1933" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The other Memorial Day tradition, at least for the last 5 years since retirement, centers
around James Hilton's 1933 book _Lost Horizon_ <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup> and
Frank Capra's magnificent 1937 film. <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>  

At the outset, a warning: this is a book and this is a film somewhat of its time.  There
will be a certain amount of casual racism that is shocking today (though conservatives
reveal themselves ever more racist each day).  The "white savior" trope is in full flower
here.  

_However,_ it is worth noting that, especially in the book, the main character acts
_against_ the prejudice others have against Asians.  He is, if anything, a forward-looking
character to a better world.  We must live in the times in which we are born, but it is
our responsibility to drag it toward a better world.  

It is a momentary refuge, a fantasy if you insist on calling it that, of a distant place
of peace, long life, and preservation of all that is good in human culture.  Like many
utopian novels (yes, I've read many), it is not so much a blueprint of _how_ to save
humanity so much as an _inspirational_ and _aspirational_ statement that this is of
value.  

Yes, to an extent we're
[drawing down the moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_down_the_Moon_(ritual))
here, but it's surprisingly effective (at least on me).  The world has been a horror show
since Trump, COVID-19, and now more Trump attempts to dynamite the foundations of American
culture.  It's not just fantasy to imagine how we might do better; it's an _essential_ to
envision what we will do, should our turn ever come again to build instead of burn.  

See?  Hopeless idealist.  


## The Sad Reality  

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/judgeluttig.bsky.social/post/3lq3asipjx22c"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-26-memorial-day-2025-luttig-1.jpg" width="200" height="465" alt="Judge Luttig @ BlueSky: Trump's unhinged Memorial Day message." title="Judge Luttig @ BlueSky: Trump's unhinged Memorial Day message." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Alas, we must, in the meantime, deal with the world before us, in its sadly degraded
state.  

Here we see The Creature's own Memorial Day message, reported by noted conservative judge
[J. Michael Luttig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Michael_Luttig).  He's one of the
_very_ few conservative figures who, to this addled old lefty scientist, seems to have his
head screwed on straight.  He _despises_ Trump.  

And, if you can fight your way through the all-caps word salad, there's a lot to despise
here.  It's not even coherent!  It's just a long venting of his spleen, spraying
bile at all who are not Trump himself.  I mean, just consider all the _adectives:_ he's
not trying to say anything factual or change any minds; he's just calling names like a
child on a school playground.  

If a normal person wrote something like this, I'd conclude "That person is not well."  But
with Trump, it seems that this is his consistent personality that he has shown us over
many years.  He may be a bit disinhibited now, but it's still his core self: bitter,
vengeful, and almost incapable of coherent thought.  

Worst of all, about 1/3 of Americans looked at that and voted "yeah, more of that."  And
all the rest of the Republican party just lies supine beneath him.  

Honestly, I don't know if we can get out of the hell-hole he's digging for us.  I can only
hope his destructive strategies will work against him.  The Republicans are clearly of no
use.  Democratic majorities in Congress in 2027 would help, but it's not clear Republicans
would convict upon impeachment.  

And it's not clear we can survive that long.  Many of us, with curtailed access to health
care, will die.  

See?  Dark and sad.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

The charge from the 2023 Memorial Day post was:  
> - Let's remember the Black origins of Memorial Day, and respect them instead of the
>   Confederate slavers.  
> - Let's work to undo the systemic, structural racism that has plagued us from the start.  
> - Let's study ways of peace, to avoid future wars, where avoidable.  
> - Since not all wars will be avoidable, let's use strength to end them quickly.

In the meantime, we have a lot of clearing out of fascists to do.  We should take
inspiration from Chumbawamba's 1998 song "The Day the Nazi Died" <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>,
shown here, about the resurgence of fascism after
[Rudolf Hess finally died in Spandau Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandau_Prison).
Today we face a much worse resurgence.  

Everyone's motto, worldwide, should be: [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/trump-danger-test/#the-weekend-conclusion)

Amusingly, this was the first in the series of "pocket books" (what we call paperbacks today) put out by MacMillan in the US.  So it's the first American paperback, ever.  

Also amusingly, I first read it in an old World War II "military edition" intended for soldiers on leave.  Putting one of the more famously and powerfully pacifist novels about escaping to a utopian paradise to avoid war?  Somebody thought it was a good idea to put _that_ in the hands of soldiers on break from fighting! It's either shockingly clueless or breathtakingly subversive. Hard to disapprove, either way.

It is about as deplorable as you may imagine.  Film critics Dreyfuss &amp; the Medveds put
this musical abomination on their list of

Don't waste a couple hours of your life watching it like I did; watch the original instead.  Then read the book! [â†©](#fn6a)
