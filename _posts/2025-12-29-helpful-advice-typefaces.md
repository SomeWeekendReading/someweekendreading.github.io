It appears that the Trump State Department has ordered a typeface switch, because apparently
sans-serif typefaces are _too DEI._  I wish I was making that up.  


## They Did _What_ Now?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-29-helpful-advice-typefaces-guardian-1.jpg" width="400" height="677" alt="Reuters Staff @ Guardian: Trump orders state department to change typefaces" title="Reuters Staff @ Guardian: Trump orders state department to change typefaces" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
We've known for some time that they're petty, racist, and stupid.  But every day, there
appears news showing that they're still _worse_ than we expect.  And so it is today: the
US Department of State has been ordered to change typefaces in all their
documents.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

What could possibly have been the reason for that?  

According to _The Guardian_, Biden's Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, ordered a switch
to the Calibri typeface in 2023.  Apparently there's evidence that Calibri is more legible
to people with certain visual impairments, and possibly to screen-reader software for the
blind.  Well&hellip; that was just _too DEI_ for the Trumpers!  So they are now demanding
a switch back to Times New Roman.  In a cable seen by _The Guardian_, they say:  

> To restore decorum and professionalism to the Department’s written work products and
> abolish yet another wasteful DEIA program, the Department is returning to Times New
> Roman as its standard typeface.  
> &hellip;  
> This formatting standard aligns with the President’s One Voice for America’s Foreign
> Relations directive, underscoring the Department’s responsibility to present a unified,
> professional voice in all communications,  

Apparently sans-serif typefaces lack "decorum", do not exude "professionalism", and
thinking that you might want to make your documents readable by the visually impaired is
"another wasteful DEIA program".  They probably think it's more _manly_, too.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-29-helpful-advice-typefaces-guardian-2.jpg" width="400" height="219" alt="Guardian illustration: Calibri san-serif (left) vs Times New Roman serif (right)" title="Guardian illustration: Calibri san-serif (left) vs Times New Roman serif (right)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Here you can see the difference, in an illustration helpfully provided by _The Guardian_.
Calibri, a sans-serif typeface, is on the left.  Time New Roman, a serif typeface, is on
the right.  The main differences are that the sans-serif font has uniform stroke weights,
no serifs at the ends of the strokes, and is in several places a bit "pointier".  

Now, if instead of banning Calibri they had banned [Comic Sans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_Sans),
I could have given them a break.  Typeface aficionados love to hate Comic Sans, but of
course in my position as resident barbarian I don't mind it.  That sort of over-refined
taste is like audiophiles who claim to hear differences in music only when they use Very
Expensive Cables: pretty clearly self-delusion, but largely harmless beyond wasting money.  

But this is something much worse: the mere fact that the switch to Calibri was made for
readability for vision-impaired people was enough to give it the stink of disability and
hence subject to DEIA witch-hunting.  Like witch-hunting, they're pursuing something that
fundamentally doesn't even exist, but Trumpers have long had impaired reality testing.

Also, it relates in a spooky way to something we previously wrote about on this Crummy
Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), about right-wing bias in training LLM AI
models. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  In
["Fit #4"](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/llm-ai-still-crap/#fit-4-the-deep-roots-of-right-wing-bias)
of that post, we looked at right-wing bias of LLM AIs trained on a large corpus of old
newspapers.  You'd think that training on substantially _everything_ would remove
viewpoint bias, but&hellip;  
- Right-wing newspapers have always been the preference of the rich.  
- Hence, right-wing newspapers had more money to work with.  This meant that:  
  - They could print on higher-quality paper that was more likely to be preserved.  
  
    Thus there's a right-wing selection bias even if you scan "everything".
  - They could afford to buy/license typefaces that might have improved legibility
    compared to the free alternatives of the day.  Since everybody wants to be mistaken
    for a member of the upper class, we've spent a lot of time with those typefaces,
    making them more recognizable by OCR software that scans them in comparison to the
    fonts used by more pedestrian publications.  
 
    Thus there's a right-wing bias in what text is generated by the OCR, upon which the
    LLM AIs are trained.  
	
Add that to the unexamined right-wing political bias of what's "worth preserving", and you
end up with quite a bias indeed toward the viewpoints of the wealthy and the conservative,
even where it seemed impossible for such bias to exist.  

Interesting fact: the [Times New Roman typeface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_New_Roman)
was created for _The Times of London_, quintessentially a conservative British newspaper.
In modern times, this has made it quintessentially the _conservative_ choice.  I won't
hold that against Times New Roman; it's perfectly acceptable as fonts go.  But it _also_
means an alliance with historical conservatives, and that may explain the (possibly
subconscious) love the Trumpers show for it.  

That, and their venomous hatred of making any accommodation at all to those with any
disability at all.  Heaven forbid people should _read_ what the US State Department writes.  


## A Modest Proposal  

In keeping with
[Jonathan Swift's 1729 satirical essay "A Modest Proposal"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal),
I have a modest proposal of my own for the Trumpers.  

It turns out, in Unicode, you can add diacritical marks (basically accents and such) to
just about any letter you like.  In fact, they compose in an unlimited way: you can add
them on top of each other, to your heart's content.  

If you really don't care about readability by those with visual impairments, and want to
flaunt it by making things hard to read even by those with perfect vision, then the staff
of the LingoJam web site has something for you: Cursed Text.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-12-29-helpful-advice-typefaces-lingojam-1.jpg" width="400" height="261" alt="LingoJam Cursed Text: 'US Department of State' with about 5% of the curse possible" title="LingoJam Cursed Text: 'US Department of State' with about 5% of the curse possible" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Basically you give the Cursed Text generator some ordinary text, and it will add
controlled amounts of chaos by putting in an absurd amount of diacritical marks.  Here,
for example, is how "US Department of State" would appear with a _very modest_ amount of
such chaos &mdash; maybe 5% of the amount possible in the UI on LingoJam.  (Though I note that,
ironically enough, it chooses by default a sans-serif typeface underneath all the cursing.)  

That's about as contemptuous of your readers as you can get, short of actually spitting in
their eyes.  Seems about on-brand for Trump.  

I'm sure if the US State Department wants to use this as their new logo, a royalty
agreement can be worked out for them to pay Your Humble Weekend Editor and the owners of
the LingoJam web site.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Look, they're already determined to bring curses on themselves.  Why not be straightforward
about being a curse upon humanity?  After all, they're not shy about all their other evil
behavior.
