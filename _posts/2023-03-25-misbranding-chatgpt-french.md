[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) about the naming of
ChatGPT.  (__Content warning:__ Remarkably stupid joke, totally skippable by Very Serious
People.)  


## On the naming of things  

> The Naming of Cats is a difficult matter,  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It isn’t just one of your holiday games;  
> You may think at first I’m as mad as a hatter  
> When I tell you, a cat must have THREE DIFFERENT NAMES. &hellip;  
>  &mdash; Opening lines of [TS Eliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._S._Eliot)'s,
>          ["The Naming of Cats"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Naming_of_Cats),
>          [__Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Possum%27s_Book_of_Practical_Cats), 1939.  

名は体を表す? (na wa tai o arawasu = names reveal the inner nature of things)  Well, not
really.  But&hellip;  

See, nobody ever lets me name things.  And for good reason! The last time I was allowed to name
something, I came up with "bprsvd": Bayesian Probit Regression with Singular Value
Decompositions.  (Don't bother googling; it was used once and then sank without a trace.)  

So I've always been curious about how things get named, and who checks those names.  In
pharma, we always had this crazy naming consultants with big books of stems in Latin &amp;
Greek, who always came up with bogus names.  Nobody can pronounce, spell, or remember
those names, so really what good are they?  

At least with drug names, in the US there are always 2 names (homage &agrave; Eliot and
his triply-named cats): the commercial name owned by the developing company and a generic name
assigned by the US FDA.  
- For example, the cancer drug Velcade has a more or less nonsensical name (because it
  induced with high "velocity" an apoptotic "cascade").  
- But the FDA generic name is just common sense: bortezomib is a "boronate proteasome
  inhibitor".  

Equally silly, a computer company deep in my CV once had naming consultants name
components of a new round of software.  They looked at the new hashtable library (why does
that even _need_ a name?!) and called it "PlanMaster." Spreadsheets were the only
kind of table they vaguely understood, and those were for planning, right?  (It was funny
until they submitted their bill.)  


## So what about ChatGPT?  

[Somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) recently&hellip; well, really
somebody _told_ me a story about the large language model AI system
[ChatGPT](https://www.chatgptonline.net/) currently
making so much news.  Alas, I have forgotten who that was; if it was you, please get in
contact with me.  For now, whoever it was has merged in my memory with my cat, the Weekend
Publisher &ndash; for reasons that will soon become obvious.  

The problem, of course, is that ChatGPT and its ilk have a tendency to lie,
[as we've noted previously on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR)]({{
site.baseurl }}/on-chatgpt/): making up references to scientific papers that don't exist,
trying to break up a reporter's marriage, threatening to torture and murder another
reporter, and so on in the manner to be expected of a BS fountain.  

So I was sitting around, somewhat atypically minding my own business.  The cat waltzed into the
room, and said:  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-25-misbranding-chatgpt-french-cat.jpg" width="225" height="435" alt="Weekend Publisher: N'as-tu jamais penser au sujet de ChatGPT en francais?" title="Weekend Publisher: N'as-tu jamais penser au sujet de ChatGPT en francais?" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
> __Cat:__ N'as-tu jamais penser au sujet de ChatGPT en fran&ccedil;ais?  
>  
> __Me:__ Wait, what?  You speak French?  Or, for that matter, speak at all?! (And in
> tu-form, no less?)  
>  
> __Cat:__ What did you expect,
> [LOLcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolcat#:~:text=Lolcat%20is%20a%20compound%20word,imageboards%20and%20other%20Internet%20forums.)?  That's just racist, man!  
>  
> __Me:__ Umm&hellip; ok.  Please proceed with&hellip; whatever this is.  
>  
> __Cat:__ See, I'm tired of all you anglo humans bugging me, a francophone cat, about ChatGPT!  You think I don't have a nose of my own?!  
>  
> __Me:__ Umm&hellip; nose?  

Unimpressed with the eloquence of my reply, he flounced from the room to attend to some
Very Important Cat Business.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

Right.  Let's figure out what the little dude was talking about.  (_Talking?!_)
- "Chat" is the easy part: just means "cat" in French. We might be on the right track!  
  - We infer from the fact that the Weekend Publisher is a little fried on this subject
    that it's being used as a noun of direct address.  
  - In other words, somebody's talking to a cat.  (Now, up until today, I would have
    regarded talking to cats as somewhat eccentric.  Nevertheless, here we are talking to
    cats now.  Invoke [St Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) and
    adjust your priors accordingly.)  
- In English, we pronounce the individual letters of "GPT" as: "gee", "pee", "tee".  
  - If we do that with the French pronunciation of letters, we get: "zhay", "pay", "tay".  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/hmpf.png" width="400" height="160" alt="Hmpf." title="Hmpf." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Hmpf. 

He's saying ["Chat, j'ai p&eacute;t&eacute;."](https://translate.google.com/?sl=fr&tl=en&text=Chat%2C%20j%27ai%20p%C3%A9t%C3%A9.&op=translate)

The link goes to Google Translate, which Explains It All to those innocent of speaking
French.  

Go ahead and have a look.  I'll wait.  I promise this page will still be here when
you get back.  No, I'm not gonna tell you; I just can't use language like that.  

Yep.  I _knew_ something about ChatGPT didn't smell quite right, and now I totally see why
the world's French-speaking cats are somewhat annoyed at being told this over and over.
They _do_ have noses of their own, you know.  

(__NB:__ French colleagues have informed me repeatedly, over the years, that this sort of
humor is juvenile in French, but not especially transgressive the way it would be in
English.  Just as well.)  

That pretty much sums it up.  (One of my favorite Oz quips from _Buffy_, S2E13, "Surprise".)  


## The museum of questionable marketing strategies  

Still, let's not be too hard on ChatGPT.  It's not like this hasn't happened before, both
verifiably and to some degree apocryphally:  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/symbolics.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/symbolics-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="83" alt="Symbolics logo" title="Symbolics logo" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- In halcyon days of yore, when [Lisp Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_machine)
  still stalked the land, I happened by great good fortune to work for
  [one of the companies that made them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolics).  It was
  a near-perfect job for me:  
  - the Lisp machine on my desk was a joy to work with;  
  - my colleagues were all smart, mostly kind, and some very funny;  
  - and I was working on a project I'd dreamt about for at least a decade, and they let me
    be more or less in charge of the early development phase.  

  Alas, our marketing department was not so inspiring.  They had real trouble
  understanding, for the most part, what made the company unique compared to other
  workstation vendors.  Also, some strategies were clearly the result of internal
  department politics and not any real thought.  To wit, the following slogan which
  appeared in all the trade rags before any of the rest of us saw it (__emphasis__ added):  

  > The future of computing is here.  
  > Is your company ready to __step in it?__  

  For the benefit of non-native speakers of English, to "step in it" is slightly rural
  slang for when you walk carelessly in a pasture and step in the, umm&hellip;
  [ordure](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ordure).  Suggesting to a potential customer
  that their employer should buy our setup so they could "step in it" was&hellip; suboptimal.

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-25-misbranding-chatgpt-french-bs-bazooka.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-25-misbranding-chatgpt-french-bs-bazooka-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="357" alt="Toshiba BS Bazooka TV" title="Toshiba BS Bazooka TV" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
- In totally different halcyon days of yore, when the Weekend Editrix and I were dating, I
  visited her family in Japan.  I noticed their large (for those days) TV in the living
  room had a very interesting bit of English branding on it, proudly announcing it was a:  
  
  > [Toshiba BS Bazooka](https://aucview.com/yahoo/l672108012/)  
  
  It turns out that "BS" meant it was ready for Broadcast Satellite reception, and apparently
  "bazooka" was a cute-sounding word for something that could put out a lot of sound.  I
  managed to stifle my giggles &ndash; though just barely, given the unintentionally honest
  description of television in general.  
  
  Turns out that particular branding never made it outside Japan.  

- No such list is complete without a couple entries from the _apocrypha automobilia_.

  These stories are not exactly "true", [_per se_]({{ site.baseurl }}/qua/), though they
  reflect a lot of the managerial groupthink and lack of diversity common to American
  carmakers of the day.  Also, they have such a punch that lack of historicity has been no
  impediment to their actually being taught in business classes; whether the MBA students
  could learn from them is somewhat more doubtful.   

  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-25-misbranding-chatgpt-french-banshee-car.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-25-misbranding-chatgpt-french-banshee-car-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="268" alt="Pontiac Banshee 1964 'Concept Car'" title="Pontiac Banshee 1964 'Concept Car'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-25-misbranding-chatgpt-french-banshee-fae.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-25-misbranding-chatgpt-french-banshee-fae-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="273" alt="Baen Sidhe" title="Baen Sidhe" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
  - In the 1960s, Pontiac introduced a [concept car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car)
    to be called the Banshee.  In those
    days, a certain market segment wanted muscle cars: power/weight ratio and gearing to
    accelerate from 0-60mph in a time short enough to suggest either suborbital launch or
    prompt lethality.  (Can you tell I was never a car guy?)  
    
    They proposed calling it a banshee, apparently from the phrase "scream like a
    banshee", thinking that "scream" must mean "goes really fast".  
    
    Atruth, though: "banshee" is the anglicized spelling of Gaelic 
    [_baen sidhe_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banshee  ), a woman
    of the Shee (a sort of fae folk).  They were said to have the nasty habit of hanging
    in trees outside your house and _screaming all night long to presage a death in your family._  
    
    Needless to say, naming a product "you're gonna die here" was&hellip; unwise.  

    The [actual truth of the story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_Banshee) is
    a wee tad more complex:  
    - On the one hand, yes they actually built prototypes to be called the Banshee.  Yes,
      they were overpowered enough to go really fast.  
    - But on the other hand, they built only 6 prototypes, all of which were eventually
      crushed.  None made it to the market.  The badging was transfered to some
      other project, about which I know nothing.  The Corvette won the internal
      political battle to be the company muscle car.  

    So&hellip; half true?  

  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-25-misbranding-chatgpt-french-chevy-nova.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2023-03-25-misbranding-chatgpt-french-chevy-nova-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="280" alt="Late model Chevy Nova" title="Late model Chevy Nova" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
  - Anent the subject of muscle cars, we next consider the
    [Chevy Nova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Chevy_II_/_Nova).  It came in
    several configurations, from ordinary sedan to muscle car with a bigger engine.  
    
    True story: in the 1970s, my elderly aunt drove one.  Now, if you look up "little old
    lady" in the dictionary, there's probably a picture of her there.  Yes, she was little
    and old, but she was very much a lady: kind, extremely polite, funny, helpful, well-mannered
    and dignified in the way one would expect.  (Can you tell I was dazzled with her as
    a child? She was an actually _sane_ family member, so always a useful example.)  
    
    She lent me her car once.  _Once._  After that I was afraid to drive it: I just tapped
    the accelerator, and by the time I could say "Whoa!" I was 3 blocks down the street.
    Apparently she bought it used, not quite understanding the concept of "muscle car".
    Give it up for the little old ladies: you might think they're frail, but you gotta be
    tough to have survived that long.  

    So far, so good.  The rest of the story is that the Nova wouldn't sell in Latin
    America, because "no va" means "doesn't go" in Spanish, which would be a poor name for
    a car.  

    Alas (or maybe the opposite of "alas"?), [it is not so](https://www.hemmings.com/stories/2017/04/07/fact-check-the-nova-did-not-sell-poorly-in-latin-america-due-to-its-name).  
    - A good Spanish speaker would probably say "no yendo" for "doesn't go".  
	- "Nova" in Spanish means both "new" and the exploding star meant in English.  
	- Apparently it was marketed under another name anyway.  
	
	So&hellip; mostly false, but a tall tale useful for instruction?  

And so, we welcome our newfound-friend, the AI ChatGPT, to the museum of failed naming in
marketing.  

You can see that the ever-so-slightly scatological translation of ChatGPT in French is
perfectly in line with the themes of death and ordure here.
[_Si monumentum requiris, circumspice,_](https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/31/travel/l-wren-s-epitaph-195156.html) 
as hardly anybody says any more.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

It's _still_ true that nobody will let me name anything.  Now you have some idea why.
