There is an apparently famous American country music singer named Dolly Parton.  I was
never a fan because&hellip; country music, ugh!  But it appears I need to be a fan of the
woman herself, because of her philanthropy and her encouragment of vaccination.
Hmm&hellip; I had _no idea._  


## Country music and me  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-08-i-guess-i-like-dolly-parton-dolly.jpg" width="200" height="280" alt="Dolly Parton (Wikipedia)" title="Dolly Parton (Wikipedia)" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Frankly, American country music and me&hellip; we don't really mix.  I always associated
with low-brow, loud, and crude entertainment for people who are (usually) annoyingly
right-wing rural types.  Not my demographic, really.  I of course have no objection to
_other_ people liking it (though I am puzzled).   I just don't want to suffer through it
personally.  

So when [somebody asked me]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#SomebodyAskedMe) to see about 
[Dolly Parton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton), I was skeptical.  I thought 
maybe I was being trolled.  I mean: the big hair&hellip; the provocative figure&hellip; 
the loudly performative stage persona&hellip; this did _not_ look hopeful!  


## OK, let's find out about Dolly Parton  

I'm happy to report that I was thoroughly wrong.  I have a heuristic about some things in
life: you should be _happy_ when you find out you're wrong, because you're about to learn
something.  Such is the case here.  

She's an accomplished artist, albeit in a particular art form that isn't my cup of tea.
Still, she practices her art at a high skill level, and that deserves some respect.  

Even more the case, 
[she's employed her wealth in quite a bit of philanthropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton#Philanthropy),
without seeking huge publicity.  That deserves _considerable_ respect.  


## What's that got to do with COVID-19 vaccines?

Apparently she had some relationship with doctors at Vanderbilt University Medical Center
who helped her recover from some injuries.  At some point, they hit her up for a donation
to vaccine development and clinical trials.  She obliged, to the point of $1 
million! <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  While I'm hesitant to say rich people can earn
respect through donations, this is clearly an important thing to have done.  

Even more impressively, she did _not_ try to get vaccinated early, but waited her turn.
When it came, she got vaccinated by her friends at Vanderbilt, and did it on video.  She
did something silly replacing part of the lyric of one of her songs with the word
"vaccine", and then got the shot.  More importantly, she encouraged others to do so as
well:  

> I'm old enough to get it.  And I'm smart enough to get it.  &hellip; And I wanted to
> tell everybody that you should go out there and do it, too.  &hellip; I'm dead serious
> about the vaccine&hellip; So I just want to say to all of you cowards out there, don't
> be such a chicken squat.  Get out there and get your shot.  

Not quite sure what a "chicken squat" is, but it doesn't sound like a compliment to those
reluctant to get vaccinated.  And the thing is, her audience demographic skews heavily
rural, white, and Republican.  We talk a lot about vaccine hesitancy among Blacks, but
statistically _the most reluctant group is White Republicans_: <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  

!["Axios: White Republican vaccine hesitancy"]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-03-08-i-guess-i-like-dolly-parton-axios.jpg "Axios: White Republican vaccine hesitancy")

So she's applying pressure to do good, be good, and act good in _exactly_ the right
place, where vaccine resistance is strongest.  And that, dear readers, is _how it is done._  

Still not a fan of country music.  But&hellip; I _may_ be a fan of this woman: smart,
kind, funny, and generous.  That's something we can all hope to imitate.
