There was once &ndash; and still is &ndash; a first-person shooter game called DOOM.  Now
it runs on&hellip; the most absurd platforms possible.  


## DOOM on&hellip; _Really_ Odd Platforms  


<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-30-doom-pdf-doom.jpg" width="400" height="212" alt="Wikpedia: the DOOM game franchise" title="Wikpedia: the DOOM game franchise" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Sometime in the early 1990s, my then-housemates brought home a shoot-em-up game called DOOM for
PCs.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> I played it a little bit, since initially it was
about shooting monsters only.  But quickly it became about shooting human-looking things
and&hellip; well, that pretty much squicked me out.  (I have a famously low tolerance for
depictions of violence in media.)  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-30-doom-pdf-doom-trinity.jpg" width="400" height="225" alt="A DOOM .wad file for Trinity College, Cambridge" title="A DOOM .wad file for Trinity College, Cambridge" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
At first there was a minor sport of making DOOM .wad files (world definitions, more or
less) to make the game appear to be happening in some interesting location.  I remember
seeing one played on the grounds of Trinity College, Cambridge, in the UK, for 
example <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, and other places.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-30-doom-pdf-doom-pregnancy.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="DOOM running (sort of!) on a pregnancy test" title="DOOM running (sort of!) on a pregnancy test" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Famously, it was also once ported to run on a pregnancy test.  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> Yes, pregnancy tests contain a (tiny) computer.  Yes,
people are crazy enough to do that. It's only a 128x32 _monochrome_ screen, so you must be
_extremely_ determined to play it that way.  (No word on whether the pregnancy test is
good for anything afterwards, either.)  

There's even [a subreddit (`r/itrunsdoom`)](https://www.reddit.com/r/itrunsdoom/) devoted
to this peculiar sport.   


## Ok&hellip; So What Have the Nerds Gone &amp; Done _Now?_  

Well, that's all good sport.  Sort of.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-30-doom-pdf-splash.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-30-doom-pdf-splash-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="314" alt="Splash screen for DOOM running in a PDF" title="Splash screen for DOOM running in a PDF" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
But now comes word that DOOM has been ported to run in&hellip; a PDF
file! <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>

How can that possibly be?  PDF (Adobe "portable document format") is a _data_ format for
documents to be displayed, isn't it?  Well, like many rich document formats (lookin' at
_you_, Microsoft Word) they eventually embrace executable content, animations, external
links, that sort of thing.  

First Word had macros, and those were a security nightmare because every Word document
became a possible vector for infection by malware.  That got sort of handled &amp; sort of
ignored.  Later, Adobe in particular added the capability to put the dreaded Javascript we
all hate so much into PDF documents.  Even some web browsers support this.  

So it was only a matter of time before someone took cross-compilation to the highest levels of
insanity, and got DOOM to compile to sufficiently elementary things that it could be put
in a PDF file.  If that PDF file is loaded in a reasonable viewer (e.g., Acrobat or,
apparently, the built-in viewer in Chrome), then you can play DOOM.  (Sorta.)  

How long until inter-office PDF documents contain hidden games?  I bet less than 15
minutes, i.e., it's already happened.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-30-doom-pdf-linux.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-06-30-doom-pdf-linux-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="346" alt="Linux booted in a PDF, using a RISC-V emulator" title="Linux booted in a PDF, using a RISC-V emulator" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
That's unpredictable fun.  But the next move was more or less entirely predictable: the same
person got a trimmed-down version of Linux to run in a PDF <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
by means of a [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/) emulator!  

This is&hellip; both silly and serious.  Not only can you smuggle in software under cover of
PDF, you can drag in a whole dang operating system.  

How long until this is a malware attack vector?  Wanna bet it's _already_ being tried?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Why in the world do people _do_ things like this?  
- On the one hand, I get the absurd humor.  

  Surrealism is always an excuse!  (At least the first time.)  
- On the other hand, this is a nontrivial amount of effort!  It might be an attempt at an arcane and
  absurd demonstration that Acrobat and other PDF viewers have not even the slightest
  _hope_ of ever being secure?  

  What will the world be like when _viewing a document_ must be eyed skeptically as a
  possible infection vector?  People open PDF documents without a thought, and will
  continue to do so no matter what security experts tell them.  
  
  Do you _really_ trust Adobe to have properly, thoroughly, and suspiciously sandboxed
  this so software running in a PDF viewer can't get out? Of course they'll say so, but
  how do you know you can take their word for it?  
  
As a friend &ndash; in fact one of the friends who introduced me to DOOM in about 1993
&ndash; said this morning:

Cynical, sure.  But it makes about as much sense as anything else.  

This was a weird timeline even before Trump began our self-inflicted destruction and
demise.
