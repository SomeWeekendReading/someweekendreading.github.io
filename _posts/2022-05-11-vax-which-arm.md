A burning question for everybody who's gotten a booster, or wants one: same arm, or other
arm?  


## Right or Left?  

Every time you get a vaccination, the person giving it will ask you which arm.  Your
humble Weekend Editor always picks the left arm, to sleep on the right side comfortably.
The Weekend Editrix also picks the left arm, so she can use her right arm more freely and
without pain.  

But the question everybody, apparently, wants to know: should we get the booster(s) in the
same arm as the original, or the other arm?  

Somebody's done a study!  


## The Same/Opposite Limb Study  

Delthia Ricks first brought it to our attention:

    In the lab: Scientists are settling a question every boosted person has asked: Does it
	matter in which arm you get your shot? Here are results from animal studiesâ€”booster
	shots in the same limb as the 1st shot yielded stronger adaptive immunity in mice

That pointed us at a summary article in Medical Xpress <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
which dropped enough hints that we could find the actual research paper in
_Science Immunology_. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

Some of the high points:  
- This was a mouse study, not human.  The vaccination was for flu, not COVID-19.  
- Mice were injected in either the ipsilateral or contralateral footpad for initial and
  booster doses (those being painfully fancy-pants words meaning "same side" or "opposite
  side").  
- Some things were pretty much the same either way, like magnitude and serum antibody
  responses.  
- But a couple things were different:  
  - Germinal centers (GCs) are places where your body responds to infection and generates
    memory B cells for long-term immunity.  Typically they're associated with lymph
    nodes.  
  - Same-side boosters generated better quality GCs with more avidity for the viral
    antigen, higher immunoglobulin mutations (varieties of stuff that gloms onto invading
    viruses), and increaseed recall of B cells for the virus.  
	
So basically, hitting the same GC in the same limb reactivated local memory B cells and
got a superior response.  Slightly.  It didn't seem to be a big effect.  

So that's what they said.  Only with graphs.  And statistics.  

I'm being a little funny here, because most of what they measured was _not statistically significant,_
and it makes me wonder if they just kept hunting until the found something that was,
regardless of the experiment design.  (See [_p-hacking_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging),
upon which we generally frown!)  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Still, the results are pretty consistent with what we expect: it mostly doesn't matter
until you look really closely.  So it's a nice little paper on a nice little issue.  In
terms of actually catching COVID-19 vs not, it probably makes no difference.  

The main thing that _does_ make a difference: get vaccinated, then get boosted.  

All else is commentary, to quote 
[Hillel in another (wonderful) context](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillel_the_Elder).
