As we've seen before,
[the biggest group of American vaccine refuseniks are White Republicans (especially men)]({{ site.baseurl }}/republicans-vs-herd-immunity/).
Guess who's swooping in to take up their vaccine supply?  


## Supply vs Demand  

In the US, basically everybody except White Republicans wants to be vaccinated, and they
want it _right now!_

In the US, vaccines are allocated (approximately!) by population density.  While
Republicans do tend to be rural and hence lower population density, their weak uptake of
vaccines means there apparently tend to be vaccines left over in their areas.  This leads
to shortages of vaccines in the Democratic areas, where everybody wants to be vaccinated
and is fighting to get to the head of the line.  Meanwhile, the Republican areas have spare
capacity due to their weak uptake.  

It didn't take long for it to dawn on people in Democratic areas searching for vaccine
appointments that there was the seed of a _strategy_ here:

    &quot;I just googled ‘Trump landslides in Ohio,’ then I looked at the nearest county
	and the biggest city in that county, and I found an appointment. The whole thing took
	me three minutes.&quot; <a href="https://t.co/38jJOk6UJF">https://t.co/38jJOk6UJF</a>

    You can see the geographic disparities in how easy it is to get a vaccine by looking
	at maps on <a href="https://t.co/6t2ahtTZni">https://t.co/6t2ahtTZni</a> of pharmacy
	appointments.<br><br>
    Here are some examples - PA/IL/GA. Barely any vaccine appointments in Democratic metro
	areas but a ton in Republican rural areas.

Well, if you're not gonna use it, somebody else will.
