I have a hard time controlling my anger at the unvaccinated, the spreaders of
disinformation, and the superstitious for prolonging the pandemic and killing people
world-wide.  Others, who are likely better people than me, have managed to find another
way.  


## Anger at the unvaccinated

[As we've written before]({{ site.baseurl }}/anger-among-vaccinated/) on this Crummy
Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR), many of us vaccinated folk are angry at the
unvaccinated.  Some of that in the US is blue-vs-red political antagonism.  Some of it is
just contempt for deadly superstition.  But a _lot_ of it is because foot-dragging on
vaccination is what prolongs the pandemic and causes variants to evolve in the susceptible
population.  

And I really don't like being angry.  I learned during the W administration that I
_shouldn't_ be that angry all the time.  I learned during the Trump administration that I
_couldn't_ be that angry all the time.  

But imagine what it's like for health care workers, to see dying patients come in every
day, angrily vaccine defiant (or even more so: remorseful, begging for the vaccine now that
it's too late).  

It's worse than caring for smokers: at least for smoking there's nicotine
addiction as an excuse, as well as the fact that smoking causes more personal health
problems instead of _public health_ problems.  


## A Compassionate Perspective, Sensitive to Minority Issues  

So it is with an article today, which first came to our attention via Eric Topol:

He points us to an article by [Amira Mohammed](https://twitter.com/AmiraMohamedMD) in
_Annals of Internal Medicine_, published today.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  It's
very short, but every word is well-chosen and it's well worth your time.  

The article is short, but quite moving: she started out with tears of relief when the
vaccines became available, moved on to anger at the willfully unvaccinated for endangering
her and the entire community, and came eventually to a position of compassion for people
who are the victims of disinformation, horribly bad education, and well-founded suspicion
that the system does not work for minorities.  

The [Tuskeegee experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Syphilis_Study), in
which 400 black men were deliberately given syphilis without their knowledge or consent,
treatment withheld, and studied as they slowly deteriorated and died over a period of 40
years (1932 - 1942).  It was sponsored by the US Public Health Service, and the CDC.
Unsurprisingly, there is very little trust and no respect at all in some minority
communities for those institutions.  

Initially Mohammed, a Black physician herself, was angry that people were refusing a
clearly beneficial vaccine.  Over time, her heart changed:  

> This sentiment was changed by an elderly African American woman who was hypoxic and
> required intubation. She started crying as soon as I questioned her about the vaccine

> For the first time in a long time, I found myself disheartened by the response. Here she

She realized that:  
- Yes, people are ignorant.  But why does the structural racism in our society keep them
  ignorant?  
- Yes, people are victims of disinformation.  But why do we tolerate disinformation, when
  the sources are clearly known?  
- Yes, people are still distrustful because of the Tuskeegee experiment.  But why do we
  refuse to take responsibility and blame for having done that experiment in the first
  place?  
- Yes, people heard famous singers and athletes voice vaccine suspicions.  But why were
  the rest of us not giving voice to the truth in "churches, barbershops, and grocery
  stores" to make sure they were exposed to the truth?  

Yes, we have a strong bias against the willfully unvaccinated, and not entirely without
reason.  _But:_ we need to guard against this becoming another pillar of racism, classism,
and cultural prejudice.  We do that with culturally sensitive outreach and education, so
people can take care of themselves properly.

## The Weekend Conclusion  

I may not be able to get past my anger at the willfully vaccinated.  But I'm glad to see
there are people in important healthcare positions like Amira Mohammed, who can.  

Maybe some of her goodness will rub off on me someday.
