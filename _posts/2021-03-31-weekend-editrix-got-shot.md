Today the Weekend Editrix got shot.  The good way: Pfizer/BioNTech PF-07302048/BNT162b2.  

## Signing up for a vaccination slot  

This was, by now long-established custom, extremely difficult.  Competing for a
vaccination slot is rather like gladiatorial combat, trying to get a slot and fill out the
form before someone else finishes and takes it from you.  Fortunately for the Weekend
Editrix, we've learned some gladiatorial technique.  

The first item was to get her on the waiting list in our state's registry for the mass
vaccination sites.  I was vaccinated at one of the mass sites, and was confident they'd
work well once we booked the appointment.  With the new waiting list, there would be no
scramble for appointments; she'd just get an email when a slot was open.  

This would almost certainly work, but the line is about 900,000 people long!  So, time to
find a shorter way if possible.  

I tried all the usual things: make a Walgreen's account and check their queue each day,
check all the local hospitals that show any availability, in fact check every site within
50 miles of Chez Weekend.  

Nothing.

So I tried a hack I'd heard about from several sources, and which most recently appeared in
_Boston Magazine_. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  (Of course, since it's now public,
the 'hole' will almost certainly be patched, because everything is optimized to keep all
of us maximally frustrated.)  Here's the trick, in broad outline, to coax a vaccine 
appointment out of CVS:  
- Go to [the CVS web site for COVID-19 vaccinations](https://www.cvs.com/immunizations/covid-19-vaccine).  
- Do this at the time new appointments drop, which appears to be in the dead of night at 12-1am and 4-5am.  
- If I were to click on Massachusetts immediately, it would tell me all appointments across the entire state are taken.  
- So don't do that: pretend you're in another state, one with a low vaccine uptake rate.  I used Alabama.  
- Answer a few questions, all of which essentially probe for whether you currently are COVID-free.  Then it will ask where you want to receive the vaccine, and here I clicked on Massachusetts.  At that point, you're past the "no appointments available" front page, and can see the appointments near your zip code as they appear.  
- If there are no appointments immediately, wait 15 minutes.  The hold on a slot while people fill out forms last 15 minutes.  If somebody is slow filling out the form (fumbling for their insurance information, for example), then it is freed and you can grab it.  

Now&hellip; that's absurd.  Nobody should have to go through such ballet to get a simple
vaccine appointment!  But&hellip; short of waiting for the state's mass vaccination sites
to clear their queue, here we are.  

And whaddaya know: it worked!  She got an appointment at a nearby CVS for a Pfizer vaccine
a few days later, and automatically scheduled an appointment for the booster 21 days
later.  Bizarre as the above procedure was, it was nonetheless easier than what I had to
do a few weeks earlier.  

So&hellip; progress.  Of a sort.  


## Getting the first dose  

We drove all of 10min to get to what is very nearly our neighborhood drugstore at the
appointed time.  

There was a kerfuffle when the person running check-in _insisted_ the Weekend Editrix had
received a text on her phone for checkin.  It took showing her the phone 3 times to
convince her that was not the case, but she was still insistent that it should be there.
In the end, we got sent to the pharmacy department for manual check-in, where they were
used to it.  

Frankly, the whole vaccine scheduling process has struck me as being full of people who
_insist_ the system is right and good and working, when the evidence in front of their
eyes is that it is _not_.  As an aspiring Bayesian rationalist, I find this hard to
understand, and harder to deal with.  But&hellip; simple stubborn persistence paid off.

Herein illustrated is the Weekend Editrix's portside dorsal&hellip; _arm_.  (She has arms;
I have tentacles.  Just so we're clear.)  She's getting a syringe of lovely
BNT162/PF-07302048, a.k.a. tozinameran/Comirnaty.  

Note that unlike your humble Weekend Editor's 
[first](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/today-i-got-shot/#the-vaccine-experience-itself) or 
[second](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/today-i-got-shot-again/#the-vaccine-experience) dose, 
the nurse here is properly gloved.  (Thanks to the medical members of my family for
pointing that out.)  Perhaps this level of sanitation is a courtesy extended only to
Japanese clients, like the Weekend Editrix, who are culturally more attuned to how clean
_everything_ is&hellip; or is not.


## Is anything getting better?  

The vaccine process itself was, for both of us, quite smooth.  Bravo to the medical
personnel who actually did the work.  Well done.  

The scheduling business, on the other hand, was a nightmare: a couple days for me madly
refreshing multiple browser tabs, and staying up late at night to exploit a back door for
her.  Nobody seems to care that the web sites for scheduling appointments are actively
hostile, or the people "facilitating" them are delusional.  It's not clear to me who exactly
isn't listening, or why, or how to change that.  


## The Weekend Sequelae  

She's only 1hr 29min into it right now, with no side effects, as expected.  Stay tuned tomorrow
for side-effect-blogging.  

## Addendum 2021-Apr-01  

The Weekend Editrix, as I'm sure you're eager to know, is fine.  Some mild sensation of
fever last night (actual temp: normal + 0.6&deg;C), and today a slightly sore arm, a
little fatigued&hellip; and that's it.  

Pretty good result!
