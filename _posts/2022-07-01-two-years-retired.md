It seems I've been retired for 2 years now.  What can 2 years of perspective tell us?


## 2 years of&hellip; what, exactly?  

I'm a little disturbed that I don't have an answer to that question.  

I retired in 2020-July, right into the teeth of the pandemic, lockdowns, and anxiously
awaiting vaccination.  We stayed home, had Zoom meetings, got groceries delivered (and
tipped well to the people taking that risky job), and so on.  It was not&hellip; _typical_
of the ways I'd imagined retirement.  

(How did I imagine retirement?  Academic libraries, seminars.  Maybe an adjunct professor
teaching statistics to undergrads &ndash; on the theory that they may one day encounter
some evidence and should have some idea of what to do with it.  With adjournments to
Club Med a couple times a year.  Silly me.)

I watched our retirement portfolio plunge in 2020, then soar&hellip; and now plunge again
in 2022.  Yes, I held and rebalanced.  No, I didn't like it.  
- The horizontal axis is time, going back about 20 years.  
- The vertical axis is retirement portfolio value, as a percent of what became our
  eventual goal.  That is, retirement could happen when this reached 100%.  
- Note the log scale on the vertical axis: exponential growth will appear as a straight
  line.  Oddly, that's what happened, despite gradual tempering of the asset allocation
  and even a switch from accumulation to decumulation.  
- The blue points show 2ce-yearly snapshots (except during the Great Recession, when I was
  too despondent to keep track).  
- The line is a least-squares fit, with confidence interval and prediction interval shown
  in shades of blue.  
- The line crossed the retirement threshold about when I retired, not entirely by
  coincidence.  
- Note the last data point's plunge early this year, back toward the threshold.  That's&hellip;
  _nerve-wracking._  Nobody's happy to see stuff like that, though most people bury their
  heads in the sand and refuse to look.  At least I'm trying to be truthful with myself here.

The cat is the only household member happy with this state of affairs, since it meant he got to have
_both_ his care-givers at home and available full-time.  I mean, look at the magnificent
bastard: at least _he's_ happy, mostly.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

So, yeah: I really dunno.  

I _do_ know we both desperately want a more normal life that the last couple years have
been.  A life filled with less pandemic, less American fascism and Republicans, less war,
less steep economic inequality, less anti-intellectualism, &hellip; less of a lot of
noxious things.  Less of society sliding back into the ignorant mud.  

I do know how to get vaccinated.  I do know how to vote.  

What I _don't_ know is how to get enough of my co-citizens to do either of those things in
the proper direction.  I don't even _understand_ why they won't get vaccinated and won't
vote more lefty.  Basically, I don't get the _wooden-headedness_ that seems so much worse in
the US now than ever before in my life.  

In the words of one of my favorite historians, Barbara Tuchman in _The March of Folly_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>:  

> Wooden-headedness, the source of self-deception, is a factor that plays a remarkably
> large role in government. It consists in assessing a situation in terms of preconceived
> fixed notions while ignoring or rejecting any contrary signs.  

That's American Republicans, right there.  Maybe the wooden heads require an
application of termites?  

Sorry, that's all I got.  The times are dark, and apparently so am I, despite attempts to 
["show an affirming flame"]({{ site.baseurl }}/greens-asymmetry/#the-weekend-conclusion).
