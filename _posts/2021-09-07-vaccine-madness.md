Have half of us gone mad?  It would seem so&hellip;  


## The madness of the American right  

I always suspected they were crazy, starting in the 1980s when Reagan utterly ceased
making sense.  After that it was just a steady decline, as all the competent
advisors abandoned ship and Congress lurched to the right with Gingrich, _et al._  Then
came the full, florid delusions of Trump.  All of a piece.  

But it seems that the vaccine resistance &ndash; _overwhelmingly_ Republican &ndash; is a
bizarre self-parody.  It's not just suicidal, placing themselves at risk; it's also
psychopathically anti-social, placing _everybody else_ at risk as well.  

Charles Blow wrote a piece in the _New York Times_ that pretty much reflects my 
view. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  Never let it be said he "buried the lede", with
opening paragraphs like this one:  

> Nothing better exemplifies the gaping political divide in this country than our
> embarrassing and asinine vaccine response. Donald Trump’s scorched earth political
> strategy has fooled millions of Americans into flirting with death. And now thousands
> are once again dying for it.  

That sums it up: people are _dying_ because of delusional right-wing ideology.

If slavish devotion to conservative madness is the cause, perhaps a slave rebellion is in
order?

I have my problems with the media.  But this opinion piece really hit the nail on the
head.  (And I like the turn of phrase: "puts them on the wrong side of a eulogy".  I _don't_
like the fact that it was necessary.)  


## Look, is it really that bad?  

Consider this from [Adam Sternbergh](http://www.adamsternbergh.com/about), a novelist and
_NYT_ editor, who apparently runs special projects at the _Times_, among many other things:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    can&#39;t stop staring in disbelief at this map of current global covid hot spots — the
    U.S., the wealthiest country in the world, where vaccines are freely available, has the
    highest per capita case rate right now of any country except Mongolia

Yes, it's really that bad: we're wealthy, vaccines are abundant and freely available to
anybody with the wit to ask for one&hellip; and we're 2nd worst in per-capita COVID-19
cases, after Mongolia.  Mongolia may be excused because they are poor and don't have an
abundance of vaccine doses.  We, on the other hand&hellip; are apparently just stupid,
suicidal, or psychopathically anti-social?  

And it's not uniformly distributed, as a property of Americans in general:  

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    of course it&#39;s also worth looking at where the cases are in the U.S. right now,
	because they&#39;re not evenly distributed<br><br>short version: high vax rate = low
	case rate and vice versa <a href="https://t.co/KYDgAR5Cp7">pic.twitter.com/KYDgAR5Cp7</a>

It's concentrated in South in the former Confederacy states, with some echoes from the
inter-mountain West.  In other words, the reddest, Trumpiest states.  

Trump wanted to build a wall.  I may be coming around to his point of view, provided it
can be built further north, say around 
[the Mason-Dixon line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason%E2%80%93Dixon_line).  That
seems to be the border of the America that's still recognizable to me as America.
