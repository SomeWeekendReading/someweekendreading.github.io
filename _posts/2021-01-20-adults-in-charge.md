Today was a good day: with the inauguration (and the constitutional mandate behind it) at
12:01pm, Biden &amp; Harris and a (barely) Democratic Congress are back in charge in the US.  


## Respected solemnities  

With respect to the solemnities of the afternoon's inauguration, we pass over them in
silence.  We can add very little thereunto.  May decisions be made in wisdom, kindness,
and respect.  


## Detested absurdities

But with respect to the absurdities of the morning's departure of the previous&hellip;
_person_&hellip;, we have somewhat to say.  (The gracious may observe 
[_de mortuis nil nisi bonum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_mortuis_nil_nisi_bonum),
but in this particular instance, here at Chez Weekend we are less than completely
gracious.  He has, after all, worked very hard to earn our disrespect.  We must not
deny him the fruits of his diligent labor.)  

May he remain far from us, with his misdeeds well and truly judged (to paraphrase
[_The Fiddler on the Roof_](https://www.moviequotedb.com/movies/fiddler-on-the-roof/quote_39604.html)).  

Furthermore, we have some suggestions for his travelling musical accompaniment.  The
military send-off he demanded this morning was totally lacking in the surrealism the
occasion demanded.  

So let us help him out a little bit here.  These video selections offer, respectively:  
1. our wishes for his speedy travel to any destination but here, 
2. an assessment of the community sentiment upon his departure, 
3. _exactly_ how much we personally wish to remember him, and 
4. some thoughts upon his likely legacy.  

(_Multae apologiae_ to our readers outside the US for the bizarre American cultural references
here.  Just trust us that they are culturally appropriate to the situation, bizarreness
included.  While here at Chez Weekend we are not usually musical theatre afficionados, we feel
that happy absurdities are just what's required for the occasion of this morning's departure.)  


## Best wishes!  

In the meantime, we offer our best wishes to the prosecutors of the Southern District of 
New York.
