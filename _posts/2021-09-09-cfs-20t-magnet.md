Today Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) and MIT's Plasma Science Fusion Center (PSFC)
announced they have successfully built high-$T_c$ REBCO magnet capable of 20T field
strength.  What should that mean to you?  


## Common-who built a what, now?

Basically, researchers at MIT and at Commonwealth Fusion Systems (an MIT spinoff) built a
big magnet.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>

So what?  Well, it's not _just_ a big magnet.  It's got some really interesting features:  
- It achieved a sustainable magnetic field strength of 20 Tesla!  As an undergrad back in
  the late Neolithic, a 1 Tesla magnet was considered pretty gnarly.  Sure, there were
  stunts in which higher fields could be achieved momentarily by explosive compression, in
  at least one case with a nuclear bomb.  Now we can do that routinely, sustainably, and
  with a high-quality field that can be sustained over long(ish) times.  
- It's using high-$T_c$ superconductors, unlike a lot of other fusion tokamaks.  High $T_c$
  means less trouble cooling.  (I'd initially thought they were going for above nitrogen
  temperature, i.e., above 70&deg;K.  But it looks like they're going down to 20&deg;K. I
  dunno why.  Thermal safety margin, maybe?  Still, now you're talking liquid He cooling,
  and that's&hellip; a whole world of difficult.)  These are REBCO magnets, built on a
  rare-earth barium copper oxide crystal, presumably in the perovskite family of the
  high-$T_c$ superconductors of yore.  Typically the rare earth in question is yttrium,
  but I wasn't able to verify that in this case. (Though to be fair, I didn't look very
  hard, either.)  
- "As soon as you give people something that looks like a wire, they try to wind it into something
  that looks like a coil", as [Eric Drexler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Eric_Drexler) 
  used to say.  But previous high-$T_c$ 
  superconductors were more like ceramics, and would break.  These are apparently more
  like a tape than a wire, but they wind just fine.  They're pretty complex composites of
  many layers of materials, only one of which is the REBCO superconductor.  
- It's large-bore: not just some dinky little chamber a couple millimeters on a side, but
  nice and big so you can fit the fusion torus of a (smallish) tokamak inside it.  
- Interestingly, they did that on time according to their plan, during a pandemic.  That's
  either impressive dedication and project management, or reckless workaholism.  Knowing
  the culture of scientists in general and MIT in particular, I venture it's probably some
  of both.  


## Why exactly is that interesting?

The very high 20T field strength means one can attempt to build a much smaller fusion
reactor.  [ITER in France](https://www.iter.org/) is a bit of a monster, what a colleague
described as "a Pharaonic endeavor" on the scale of the Great Pyramids at Giza.  A lower
field magnet would lead to a tokamak about 40x larger than the MIT/CFS design.  

It turns out that the volume of the tokamak &ndash; a rough indicator of cost &ndash;
scales as the inverse cube of the $\mathbf{B}$ field: $V \propto \left|\mathbf{B}\right|^{-3}$.
So if you double the $\mathbf{B}$
field, you get to shrink the volume by a factor of 8.  That means half the linear size in
each dimension.  Of course, a smaller reactor will produce less power than a big one, but
at 1/8th the cost you can build a couple of them.  

The MIT PSFC developed a fusion reactor based on the assumption one could have a high
$\mathbf{B}$-field, and hence high plasma pressure available.  That would allow
considerable scale-down of size, which makes everything else less like building the Great
Pyramids.  ITER will run at 9 Tesla, so running at 18&ndash;20 Tesla gives running room
for about a factor of 8 scale-down in volume.  


## ARC reactor (yes, it's really called that) &amp; SPARC testbed  

It was called the [ARC reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC_fusion_reactor), for
"affordable, robust, compact". <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>

The testbed for ARC is the smaller 
[SPARC reactor](https://www.psfc.mit.edu/sparc) <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, 
apparently jointly designed by MIT PSFC and CFS.  It starts construction pretty much now,
with the availability of the high-field high-$T_c$ magnets, in Devens, Mass (formerly
Ft. Devens).  It's projected to be operational in 2025.  

It' supposed to generate up to 140MW of power in 10sec bursts.  It looks like the magnets
will not quench below 77&deg;K, though they're for some reason trying to operate at
10&deg;K.  The fusion gain, or power out over power in, is expected to be around 
$Q \sim 11$!  


## Workable fusion power  

With some luck, CFS &amp; PSFC are tenatively predicting this could lead to workable
fusion power plants by 2030.  That's&hellip; _very specific_.  Fusion has been 20 years
away for all of my lifetime; I was resigned to it _always_ being 20 years away for the
rest of my life.  

Maybe I need to change my mind on that.  Maybe there's hope for humanity yet in the face
of hostile climate change.  

I hate false hope.  So, not to get _too_ meta, I hope this is real hope.
