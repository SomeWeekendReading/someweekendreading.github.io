So, here in the US it's [Memorial Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day).  Again.  


## Time to have a think about war and violence in the US  

Long past time, actually.  

But honestly&hellip; I just _can't._  

We're working through the COVID-19 pandemic, now there's crazy monkeypox cropping up, war
has broken out in Europe with attendant war crimes unrepentantly committed, and now
mass gun violence here in the US.  Again.  Both of the racist variety and the
just-plain-old-murdering-children variety.  

And our institutions quiver helplessly, paralyzed by right-wing disinformation about the
pandemic and right-wing gun-hugging that literally requires periodic human sacrifice, even of
the lives of _children._  

It's too much for me to face at once.  


## A momentary refuge in fantasy  

<a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/lost-horizon-1937-ox0abm/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-30-memorial-day-2022-lost-horizon-1.jpg" width="400" height="132" alt="PBS: 'Lost Horizon', 1937, directed by Frank Capra" title="PBS: 'Lost Horizon', 1937, directed by Frank Capra" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-30-memorial-day-2022-lost-horizon-2.jpg" width="400" height="559" alt="James Hilton: 'Lost Horizon', 1933" title="James Hilton: 'Lost Horizon', 1933" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
So I took refuge in comforting fantasy this week: first re-watching the 1937 Frank Capra
film _Lost Horizon_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>, and then re-reading the 1933 James
Hilton novel, of the same title, upon which the film was based. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>
The last time I'd seen the movie was in the early 1990s, and the last time I'd read the
novel was in the early 1980s.  So it was _almost_ like a new encounter, memory being what
it is.  

PBS has put the Capra film on the web (click through the image to watch!).  It's mostly
restored, with only a few still pictures for missing scenes.  Though, famously, Capra
burned the first 2 reels and released the film starting with the 3rd reel after disappointing
reactions from test screenings.  The content of those first 2 reels is forever lost.
Capra even claimed once to Dick Cavett that he "didn't remember" what was on them!
Apparently it was nitrate film, too, because Capra said they "kind of exploded" when he
threw them in the incinerator.  Today the Library of Congress and the National Film
registry have been restoring and preserving it, because it is "culturally, historically, or
aesthetically significant".  

Somewhat inexplicably, at the end the PBS video above says "Copyright &copy; 2020 Northwest
Indiana Public Broadcasting, Inc." &ndash; I have _literally no idea_ what they mean by
attempting to copyright a 1937 film that way?!  

The plot is interesting, both as an allegory and as a directly &amp; literally applicable
warning to the present day.  In the 1930s, a British diplomat in western India (modern
Pakistan) helps some people escape a local revolution.  However, their mysterious pilot secretly
kidnaps them, flying to a remote mountain lamasery and valley in Tibet.  There they discover they
have been recruited to join a small society collecting the world's art, music, literature, and
scientific knowledge to withstand "the coming conflagration" &ndash; the fear of World War
II that was already in the air in 1933.  

It's a good representative specimen of the utopian novel, a genre of which I was quite
fond in my late teens (slightly to the chagrin of a literature teacher who wanted me to
read Orwell's _1984_ instead, which is about like supplanting a field of wildflowers with
an abbatoir).  

The film is a fine example of the warm, rich emotional comfort food for which Capra is justly
famous as a director.  (Or infamous for sentimentality, if that's the way you run.)  It
has its limits, of course:  
- A little more of the casual racism of the 1930s survives than I can easily ignore,
  especially the use of White actors to play Asian characters.  
- There's a love story injected by force for the usual Hollywood reasons; it is clearly a
  foreign object that doesn't belong in the story.  
- It's more than a bit over-acted, but then again that was more or less the style of the
  period.  

However, it goaded me to return to Hilton's book, which is still as richly satisfying as I
remember from my first encounter with it 40 years ago.  Yes, there's also a bit of the
casual racism of the 1930s, but it's chiefly present to show how much the hero is
_against_ racism and respects Indians, Chinese, and Tibetans.  Yes, there's a bit of the
"White savior" complex, but then again it's also about the White outsiders figuring out
how to fit themselves into this Tibetan valley in a harmonious way and how they can adopt
the local culture themselves.  

That led me to wonder: how can we perform whatever small actions as are within our
capabilities to build such an ideal society, our own bits of _tikkun olam?_ Kindness to
those around us, acquiring the knowledge of civilization and our place in history to share
with others, and cultivating an attitude of being peace-makers seem to be important
starting points.  

Those are, at any rate, important elements of religious practice for me.  


## Sometimes the truth bears repeating  

So, given that my feelings on the subject of violence have not changed, let's review 
[the post from last year upon the anniversary of the 9/11 attack]({{ site.baseurl }}/war-memorials/).
John Gorka's musical setting of the Stafford and Dean poems is as masterful in performance
as it is an accurate summary of my feelings.  

>My favorite meditation on war memorials is William E Stafford's poem, "At the
>Un-National Monument along the Canadian Border" <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>:  
>  
>> This is the field where the battle did not happen,  
>> where the unknown soldier did not die.  
>> This is the field where grass joined hands,  
>> where no monument stands,  
>> and the only heroic thing is the sky.  
>>  
>> Birds fly here without any sound,  
>> unfolding their wings across the open.  
>> No people killed &ndash; or were killed &ndash; on this ground  
>> hallowed by neglect and an air so tame  
>> that people celebrate it by forgetting its name.

>I also cannot recommend highly enough the version [John Gorka](https://www.johngorka.com) set to
>music <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> (and, for that matter, the rest of John Gorka's
>pandemic mini-concerts on _YouTube_, which have been fabulous).  He really captures the
>longing for safe spaces, peaceful places not disfigured by war.  (Might have to go a long
>way, to some rather remote place to achieve that.  I hear
>[Lake Vostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Vostok) is lovely this time of
>year&hellip; but that's a _different_ fantasy.)

>Cut from similar cloth also is this Gorka song, "Let them in".  <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>
>  
>It's based on a WWII-era sonnet by Elma Dean called "A Letter to St.
>Peter". <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> She implores St. Peter, traditionally the guardian of
>the gates of Heaven, to admit the arriving souls of newly dead soldiers, with specific
>commentary as to how to heal and comfort them.  It's viscerally difficult for me to read without
>tears, having seen my country spend literally a _generation_ at war, mostly pointlessly:  
>  
>> "Letter to St. Peter", by Elma G Dean  
>>  
>> Let them in, Peter, they are very tired;  
>> Give them the couches where the angels sleep.  
>> Let them wake whole again to new dawns fired  
>> With sun not war. And may their peace be deep.  
>> Remember where the broken bodies lie &hellip;  
>> And give them things they like. Let them make noise.  
>> God knows how young they were to have to die!  
>>  
>> Give swing bands, not gold harps, to these our boys.  
>> Let them love, Peter, &ndash; they have had no time &ndash;  
>> Girls sweet as meadow wind, with flowering hair&hellip;  
>> They should have trees and bird song, hills to climb &ndash;  
>> The taste of summer in a ripened pear.  
>> Tell them how they are missed. Say not to fear;  
>> It's going to be all right with us down here.  
>  
>Gorka's setting &ndash; with slightly revised lyrics &ndash; combines grief and regret for
>all the pain and death and loss, while desperately imploring divine kindness.  The best
>summary I found of it was: "If Memorial Day needed a song, then this should be it."  Yeah,
>maybe Veteran's Day, too.  
>  
>Both of these anti-war songs are a bit of the
>[divine madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_madness) to which I wish we would all aspire.  


A good book, a good movie, and some good songs for bad times.
