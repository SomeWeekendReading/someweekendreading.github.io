Remember last month, when we had the story about [people in Greece bribing doctors for fake vaccines, and doctors taking the money but giving real vaccines](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/lessons-covid/#lesson-2-vaccines-in-greece-and-how-doctors-respond)?  Even though that story has some believability challenges, it's no longer the weirdest vaccine story I've heard.  Move over, Greece: the Italians are on the job.  (And where _are_ the French surrealists, anyway?)  


## Creative ways to avoid vaccination

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-05-fake-arm-vaccine-bbc.jpg" width="400" height="219" alt="BBC: Dodging vaccination with a rubber arm?!" title="BBC: Dodging vaccination with a rubber arm?!" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
People have tried all sorts of ways to avoid being vaccinated: outright refusal, fake vax
cards, bribes, &hellip; all sorts of things.  But from Italy via the 
venerable Beeb <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> comes a story that shows what happens when
people who take surrealism _seriously_ show up:  
- A healthcare worker, needing a valid vaccination card complete with proper computer
  records because of a mandate, more or less has to get vaxxed.
- He does _not_ want to be vaccinated, for reasons we need not understand.  

The obvious solution? Spend almost __500 euro on a silicone male chest half-body suit__, and
hope the vaccine will go into the rubber, not his flesh.  _Obviously._  

Also obviously, the nurse administering the shot was not having any, and reported him to
the police.  

People are creative.  More often than they're sensible, apparently.  


## Addendum 2021-Dec-06: Details!  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-05-fake-arm-vaccine-la-repubblica.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-12-05-fake-arm-vaccine-la-repubblica-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="282" alt="la Repubblica: Dr No Vax and the rubber arm" title="la Repubblica: Dr No Vax and the rubber arm" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
We chased down the original source for this very important news, to an article by Carlotta
Rocci in _la Repubblica_. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  We show it here under Google
Translate, since at Chez Weekend we do some Latin, but precious little Italian.  

It just gets weirder and weirder.  The comedian in this case is a dentist named Guido
Russo, who styles himself "Doctor No Vax".  On his office door, shown here, is a sign
advising potential patients that the "Green Pass" (vaccine proof) is "strictly
voluntary".  (The Italian government may have a somewhat orthogonal opinion on this.)  He is
apparently suspended due to a refusal to vaccinate.  

There's some possibility that he even posted his plans on Twitter under a pseudonym
(apparently in Cyrillic, because it just _has_ to get weirder).  The picture of the
silicone male torso is&hellip; disorienting.  

Wouldn't it just be easier to get vaccinated?  And then, you know, not have to worry about
COVID-19?
