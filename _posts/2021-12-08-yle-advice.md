YLE has some important advice for all of us about surviving Omicron.  


## Some Informed Advice From An Expert  

Want to survive omicron?  Good choice.  

Probably you should take advice from well-informed experts who know what actions are
likely to help, right?  Of course!

Katelyn Jetelina ([CV](https://daj9cl0xcfutq.cloudfront.net/cv/jetelina.pdf)), a.k.a. the
blogger behind _Your Local Epidemiologist_ &amp; professor of epidemiology at UTexas
Houston, is one such expert.  Today she told us about some of the latest lab data on
Omicron: its rate of infection, severity, vaccine evasion experiments, and so
on. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

All very interesting, but&hellip;  

I'm not going to tell you about _any_ of it.  

Instead, I'm going to tell you her extremely well-informed and useful advice (emphasis added):  

> We’re all exhausted. The scientists. The healthcare workers. The parents. The
> pharmacists. The teachers. Everyone. But the virus isn’t. And it won’t be until we all
> take it seriously. __Wear a good mask. Ventilate spaces. Test, test, test. And, for the
> love of all things, go get your vaccine and/or booster.__

It's good advice.  You should take it.
