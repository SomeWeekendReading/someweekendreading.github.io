You know how world political, business, and financial leaders fetishize suits?  Physicists
do not do that.  


## Zelensky Among the Suits  

Ukrainian president [Volodymyr Zelensky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy), 
currently president of Ukraine, has famously decided during the
[Russo-Ukrainian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War) to wear a khaki
t-shirt and pants in solidarity with the soldiers of Ukraine.  I approve, not that anybody
cares what I think.  

However, it played out interestingly in a meeting with world leaders:

["One of these things is not like the other ones"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_of_These_Things_(Is_Not_Like_the_Others)), eh?  

Physicist Cliff Burgess pointed out above that while this may be a fashion _faux pas_
among politicians, amongst our tribe this is known as _physics formal_.  
- Can confirm: this is US east coast physics formal, my tribe of many years.  
- On the US west coast, a Hawaiian shirt, shorts, socks and sandals are also very much _en
  vogue_ as an alternative.  
- In Europe, it usually involves black denim pants and a variety of loose-fitting shirts.  

Other captions suggested have been:  
- An academic at an industry conference. Can confirm: been there, done that.  
- Linux sysadmin forced into a meeting with management. Can confirm: seen it, but never
  done it myself as I'm not a sysadmin.  

I mean, he's wearing the _clean_ t-shirt and the formal, darker jeans that _haven't_ faded
too much yet.  Do you really expect more?  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

One of these guys is facing reality quite a bit more head-on than the others.
