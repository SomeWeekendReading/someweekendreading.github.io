Qualitative knowledge is real, but... quantitative knowledge is almost always _better_.  

On the importance of being able to express your beliefs about the world in _mathematical_
terms, a venerable quote from famous 19th century physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron
Kelvin.  He's worth listening to, as he's the inventor of large swaths of thermodynamics
(and, to be fair, a few silly predictions like "there is nothing new to be discovered in
physics" on the eve of the quantum mechanics &amp; relativity revolution!):

>In physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it. I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of __science__, whatever the matter may be.
