It's now 24hr into my course of paxlovid for COVID-19.  


## So far, so&hellip; meh?  

Having COVID-19 as an older person, even with paxlovid, is no fun.  

So far, I'm still running about 1.5&deg;C fever (despite aspirin), and still pretty achy
and very tired.  Last night was full, and I mean _full,_ of some _very annoyingly_
exciting diarrhea.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  There are a number of nocturnal
excitements upon which I might look favorably; this was not one of them.  

Still, I haven't gotten the famous bitter, metallic, quinine-like taste that people report
from paxlovid.  Which is disappointing, because (a) I _like_ quinine, and (b) I want to
know paxlovid's _doing_ some good.  

Still&hellip; nothing has gotten worse, and for that I'm thankful.  It takes 5 days for a
reason <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>, and I'm only 1 day in.  

Really, really thankful to have gotten paxlovid with a minimum of jumping through hoops.
Even the insurance cooperated, for some arcane reason.  

## The most important dish in tonight's dinner  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-07-26-paxlovid-day-1-paxlovid-1.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="3rd dose of paxlovid: the most important part of dinner" title="3rd dose of paxlovid: the most important part of dinner" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
&hellip; is 2 tabs nirmatrelvir + 1 tab ritonavir.  Compliments to the chefs.  

You can see the hilarious (to me) embossing of "3CL" on the nirmatrelvir front side, and
"PFE" on the back side.  No idea what's on the ritonavir, or why.  

Also, you can see the packaging looking gnawed by a velociraptor.  This is because the
packaging designers (a) have no understanding of what a lever arm is, and (b) no desire to
ask what that means for the finger joints of possibly older patients.  Or, perhaps they
_do_ know these things and are just vicious people.  In any case, I _eventually_ got it
open.  I may have said a bad word.  

But, bad word or no, I'm grateful to have it.  Though not so grateful to _need_ it.
