Hank Green once again has one or two true and useful words to say to young people about COVID-19
vaccination.  


## Dude knows what he's talking about

[Last November, we featured]({{ site.baseurl }}/vaccine-sense-from-hank-green/) a sensible
word or two from [Hank Green](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hank_Green) (notable web
producer, author, and master of miscellany) in his weekly vlog to his brother.  Bizarrely,
Google says that's the most frequent search hit of all the pages on _this_ blog.  People are&hellip;
a bit weird.  

Now vaccines are available fairly widely for free (at least in the US), and even to people
as young as 12.  So Green has a thing to two to say to young people specifically.  And take
it from a grumpy old scientist: he _still_ knows what he's talking about.  


## Summary of the high points  

Some of his points:  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-05-12-more-vaccine-sense-from-hank-green-nyt.jpg" width="400" height="270" alt="NYT: US vaccinations/day Jan - mid-May" title="NYT: US vaccinations/day Jan - mid-May" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
- The graph of vaccinations _vs_ time is flattening out, when it should go up to 100% as fast as possible.  (Actually, it's worse than that: _declining_.  See the graph from [the _New York Times_ COVID tracking page](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html).)  This is a problem: a public health problem, i.e., for all of us, not just individual choices.  
- Excuses and responses to vaccination delay:  
  - __Excuse:__ "It's slightly unpleasant, and I'll feel crappy."  
    - __Response:__ COVID-19 is way crappier, especially if you give it to somebody else
      inadvertently, who may die from it. Vaccination lowers the risk of that by 95%.  _Get vaccinated._  
  - __Excuse:__ "I'm young, it won't be so bad."  
    - __Response:__ Yes, it might be.  Hospitalization is a terrible thing to experience,
      and raises your risk of "long COVID" side effects for years, or possibly the rest of
      your life.  _Get vaccinated._  
  - __Excuse:__ "It's just my decision for my welfare."  
    - __Response:__ No, everybody who got COVID-19 got it from somebody else.  Sometimes
      they're asymptomatic carriers who spread it.  Don't be that person.  _Get vaccinated._  
  - __Excuse:__ "What about variants?"  
    - __Response:__ Every COVID-19 variant evolved in an infected person.  Don't be that
      person, either.  _Get vaccinated._  
  - __Excuse:__ "Maybe I already had COVID-19."  
    - __Response:__
      ['Natural' immunity is inferior]({{ site.baseurl }}/natural-vs-vaccine-immunity/) to
      the very high immunity from the vaccines.  _Get vaccinated._  
  - __Excuse:__ "I feel like getting vaccinate is giving up control."  
    - __Response:__ Getting vaccinated is you _taking back_ control!  _Get vaccinated._  

It's a big deal, sure; but it's an easy decision to make.  _So make it._  

Green's obviously heartfelt plea, on a personal basis:  
> "Hi, I'm Hank Green.  I make science videos.  I've been making educational videos for
> people for free on the internet for over 10 years, and maybe you want to do me a favor!  
>   
> It's super easy.  There's a link in the description.  You can click on it, put in your
> zip code, and make your appointment for getting your COVID vaccine.  Put it in your
> phone, then go do it.
>  
> And get a free donut." <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

Respect.

I did, however, get high-quality immunity, so I'll just have to live with the fact that the nearest [Krispy Kreme](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/free-with-covid-vaccine-krispy-kreme-marijuana-beer-and-more.html) is like 2 states away.
