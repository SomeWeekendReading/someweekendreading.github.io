Today marks 2 decades since [the 9/11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks)
on the World Trade Center in NYC, the Pentagon in DC, and a third target that was
spared because airline passengers forced a crash in Shanksville, PA.  It also marks,
with the recent US withdrawal from Afghanistan, at least a winding down, though possibly not
a complete ending, of 20 years of war.  It's time to think about war memorials&hellip; sort of.  


## "Not as it was, but as it should have been"  

My favorite meditation on war memorials is William E Stafford's poem, "At the
Un-National Monument along the Canadian Border" <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>:  

> This is the field where the battle did not happen,  
> where the unknown soldier did not die.  
> This is the field where grass joined hands,  
> where no monument stands,  
> and the only heroic thing is the sky.  
>  
> Birds fly here without any sound,  
> unfolding their wings across the open.  
> No people killed &ndash; or were killed &ndash; on this ground  
> hallowed by neglect and an air so tame  
> that people celebrate it by forgetting its name.

I also cannot recommend highly enough the version [John Gorka](https://www.johngorka.com) set to
music <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> (and, for that matter, the rest of John Gorka's
pandemic mini-concerts on _YouTube_, which have been fabulous).  He really captures the
longing for safe spaces, peaceful places not disfigured by war.  (Might have to go a long
way, to some rather remote place to achieve that.  I hear
[Lake Vostok](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Vostok) is lovely this time of
year&hellip; but that's a _different_ fantasy.)

Cut from similar cloth also is this Gorka song, "Let them in".  <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>

It's based on a WWII-era sonnet by Elma Dean called "A Letter to St.
Peter". <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> She implores St. Peter, traditionally the guardian of
the gates of Heaven, to admit the arriving souls of newly dead soldiers, with specific
commentary as to how to heal and comfort them.  It's viscerally difficult for me to read without
tears, having seen my country spend literally a _generation_ at war, mostly pointlessly:  

> "Letter to St. Peter", by Elma G Dean  
>  
> Let them in, Peter, they are very tired  
> Give them couches where the angels sleep, and light those fires  
> Let them wake whole again, to brand new dawns  
> Fired by the sun not wartime's bloody guns  
> May their peace be deep, remember where the broken bodies lie  
> God knows how young they were to have to die  
> God knows how young they were to have to die  
>  
> So give them things they like, let them make some noise  
> Give dance hall bands not golden harps, to these our boys  
> And let them love, Peter. For they've had no time,  
> They should have trees and bird songs and hills to climb  
> The taste of summer, in a ripened pear,  
> And girls sweet as meadow wind, with flowing hair  
> And tell them how they are missed, but say not to fear  
> It's gonna be alright, with us down here.  

Gorka's setting combines grief and regret for all the pain and death and loss, while desperately
imploring divine kindness.  The best summary I found of it was: "If Memorial Day needed a
song, then this should be it."  Yeah, maybe Veteran's Day, too.  

Both of these anti-war songs are a bit of the
[divine madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_madness) to which I wish we would all aspire.
