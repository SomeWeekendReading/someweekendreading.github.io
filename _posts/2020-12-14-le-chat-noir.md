Apparently the Weekend Publisher, occasionally also known as "my cat", is the reincarnation
of the spirit animal of a fin-de-si&egrave;cle cabaret in Paris.   

Who knew? <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>

I mean, I _always knew_ he was the reincarnation of of some ancient Egypitian cat-deity
like [Bastet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastet).  And of course, Bastet, being a deity
no doubt capable of frequently recurring, at-will acts of reincarnation, would definitely
be catting around fin-de-si&egrave;cle Paris, because _everybody_ wants to do that.  My
cat's not _stupid_&hellip;  Crazy, sure.  But not stupid.  

Though, now that I come to think of it, Bastet was a a cat _goddess_.  That means my tomcat
is the _trans male_ reincarnation of an ancient Egyptian cat deity.  Ok, nothing wrong with
that, right?  We need to accept trans people, and my cat thinks he's a person, so we're
all cool with him.  

And, really: once you buy into the business of "reincarnated ancient
Egyptian cat deity", you can't just decide to balk at the trans part, right?  Be cool.   

C'mon, don't embarass me here.  The cat is watching.  

The cat is _always_ watching.
