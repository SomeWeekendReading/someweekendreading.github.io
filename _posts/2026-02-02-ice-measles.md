It seems that measles has broken out in ICE detention centers.  Also, ICE has stopped paying for
detainee health care.  Do the math.  


## Measles in the US in 2026

Now that RFKJr is making war on public health in general and vaccination in general,
perhaps we should check in on the data to see the fruits of his labor.  

The data journalists at _CNN_ have been collecting data from (what's left of) the CDC, as
well as from Johns Hopkins and the Center for Outbreak Innovation.  At least we still
mostly _have_ these data, and can see what's going on (though I expect that possibly the
CDC data reporting may be shut down based on what's happening, _q.v._).  

They've made a little interactive tool that shows you the cumulative cases of measles in
the US, as of the current date. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  Here's what it's showing
as of today, 2026-Feb-01:  
- The horizontal axis is time within a given year.  
- The vertical axis is the total number of measles cases seen so far that year.  
- The curves shown are for 2023, 2024, 2025, and now the first month of 2026.  

The obvious and disturbing conclusion is that 2023 and 2024 were sort of ok, 2025 was a
major disaster of public health, and 2026 is shaping up to be far, far worse.  We remind
everyone that measles is _the most contagious disease known to humanity,_ with $R_0 \sim$
12-18.  That means ever infected person, absent vaccinations and quarantines, will infect
12-18 others.  As we've analyzed
[before on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR)](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/vax-vs-knuckleheads/#first-do-the-math),
that means to stop an outbreak you need vaccination rates greater than $1 - 1/R_0$, or
about 91% &ndash; 94% of the population.  That's why, Chez Weekend, we got MMR boosters
last spring: idiots are no longer getting vaccinated and thus posing a risk to the rest of
us.  

This coming year will be a very difficult one, from the perspective of avoiding the
avoidable illnesses.  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-cnn-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-cnn-3-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="346" alt="Matthews, et al. @ CNN: US MMR vax rates for kindergartners, by state" title="Matthews, et al. @ CNN: US MMR vax rates for kindergartners, by state" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
You can see the pattern of childhood vaccinations at kindergarten age in this map,
accompanying the _CNN_ measles reporting tool.  

We're pretty happy about the state of New England, where Ch&acirc;teau Weekend finds
itself.  (Ok, New Hampshire, as always, is a conservative laggard.  Vermont is a bit more
puzzling.)  But many other states, in the Deep South and the Midwest, seem to be playing
roulette with their children's health by not getting measles vaccinations.  

Honestly, I just don't understand why that's not grounds for a charge of child abuse.  


## ICE Captivity: Maggot-Infested Food, Dangerously Poor Sanitation, No Medical Care, Beatings, and Now&hellip; Measles  

We've known from multiple reports that ICE detention is downright barbaric, more the
creation of sadistic thugs than of a civilized nation.  All the reports say people sleep
on concrete floors without blankets, the food is infested with maggots, the sanitation
facilities have far too few showers &amp; toilets, so the result is stink and disease.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-ap-1.jpg" width="400" height="485" alt="Biesecker, et al. @ AP: ICE claims man's 8 skull fractures and 5 brain hemorrhages were self-inflicted" title="Biesecker, et al. @ AP: ICE claims man's 8 skull fractures and 5 brain hemorrhages were self-inflicted" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
It also appears that this is accompanied by beatings.  A recent report out of
Minneapolis <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> told of a man taken into ICE custody, and
then taken by ICE to a hospital 4 hours later.  This is what the _Associated Press_
got out of interviews with a doctor and 5 nurses:  
- The patient was taken into custody with a self-issued warrant from ICE, not a judge.  So
  the detention is legally questionable from the get-go.  
- He had a black eye, deeply swollen face, bleeding, and was delirious to the point of
  having difficulty talking.  
- Imaging showed that his skull was fractured in 8 places, and that he had 5 brain areas
  with life-threatening hemorrhages.  
  
Upon being asked, ICE officers said he was handcuffed and "purposefully ran head-first
into a brick wall".  Now, it is _physically impossible_ to get multiple skull fractures on
both the left and right side from running head-first into a brick wall with ones hands
cuffed behind one's back.  The first time would have incapacitated him, let alone left him
in a position to do so multiple times and cause multiple hemorrhages.  

> “It was laughable, if there was something to laugh about,” said one of the nurses, who
> spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not
> authorized to discuss patient care. “There was no way this person ran headfirst into a
> wall.”  

This man was, in the opinion of the attending doctors and nurses, _clearly_ tortured.  

After all, which is the more likely scenario:  
- An acrobatically talented and physically durable prisoner ran into a brick wall multiple
  times, giving himself multiple life-threatening injuries, or  
- ICE just beat him nearly to death, got scared, took him to a hospital, and then lied
  about it?  

_Hint:_  Any scenario which involves ICE lying is probably the more likely scenario.  

This is the eternal response of abusers everywhere: blame the victim.  He somehow beat
himself almost to death, while ICE officers were watching helplessly.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-news4sa-1.jpg" width="400" height="260" alt="Warner @ News4SA: Measles outbreak at Texas ICE facility confirmed by DHS" title="Warner @ News4SA: Measles outbreak at Texas ICE facility confirmed by DHS" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-sacurr-1.jpg" width="400" height="356" alt="Koithan @ SA Current: Measles outbreak at ICE Dilley family detention facility" title="Koithan @ SA Current: Measles outbreak at ICE Dilley family detention facility" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Isn't that bad enough?  Clearly not, in this worst of all possible worlds.  

Two different sources report <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup> <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>,
and DHS confirms, that _measles_ has broken out in the Dilley Immigration Processing
Center (ICE detention), in Texas.  When you're being fed food infested with parasites,
have less sanitation than livestock in a crowded barn, sleep on cold concrete, and are
fsubject to beatings, measles will make everything much, _much_ worse.  

Again, as the most contagious disease known to humanity, we expect this to rip through the
ICE detention center and likely kill many.  Do you want to take bets on what the MMR
vaccination rate is among ICE detainees?  (Or among ICE guards, for that matter?)  

We note that this center detains _children,_ currently over 400 of the 1200 detainees.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-tucson-1.jpg" width="400" height="209" alt="Bregal @ Tucson.com: Measles outbreak at Arizona ICE detention centers" title="Bregal @ Tucson.com: Measles outbreak at Arizona ICE detention centers" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
And it's not just the Texas facility.  An independent report documents another measles
outbreak in Florence, Arizona. <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  

Far from quarantining the outbreak to stop the spread, ICE officials were shipping
detainees on buses to Newark and Philadelphia, almost ensuring the spread of measles to
those facilities.  

ICE officials, of course, admit nothing.  However, they did say something very peculiar:
instead of releasing detainees to a local church which has customarily taken care of newly
released persons, they were being released _to a bus depot,_ apparently so they could go
infect someone elsewhere (__emphasis__ added):  

> Pastor Hector Ramirez, of Iglesia Cristiana el Buen Pastor in Mesa, said his church has
> been receiving immigrants released from Florence and Eloy detention centers since 2018.&hellip;  
>  
> But later, Ramirez got an email saying
> __11 migrants would instead be released to the Phoenix bus depot,__ rather than his church,
> to ensure his staff wouldn't risk exposure to measles.  
>  
> "He told me, 'Knowing that your volunteers are (older) adults and not wanting to expose
> them, we're not going to bring them to your church,'" he said.  

So they _know_ there's exposure risk, and they're just encouraging people to get on buses
instead of going to the local group that normally takes care of new releases?
Just&hellip; _cause disease elsewhere?!_  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-tnr-1.jpg" width="400" height="523" alt="Olmsted @ TNR: ICE has cut its detainees off from medical care" title="Olmsted @ TNR: ICE has cut its detainees off from medical care" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Now, how could ICE make this situation worse?  

Well, how about refusing to pay for medical services for detainees?  A report from
_The New Republic_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup> says ICE has accrued hundreds of
millions of dollars of unpaid medical bills for healthcare provided to detainees.  
Furthermore, ICE is not only refusing to pay for medical care, but outright refusing to
_allow_ medical care in the first place:  

> To be clear, ICE is not simply not paying for detainees’ medical treatment: Multiple
> reports suggest they are not providing it at all, even though federal law requires them to
> do so. Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff released a report in October documenting at least “85
> credible reports of medical neglect” at U.S. detention centers.   

As a result, people in detention are dying, whether of disease, beatings, or outright
murder by ICE agents:  

> Seven immigrants died in ICE custody in December, making it the deadliest month since
> Donald Trump returned to the White House. And 2025 was the deadliest year for immigrants
> in detention since 2004.   
>  
> So far, January is on track to be even worse: At least six people have already died in
> ICE custody this year, including one man who reportedly was choked to death by an ICE
> agent.   

ICE is, however, not without a response.  It's an _evil_ response, but still a response,
as pointed out by epidemiologist Elizabeth Jacobs:  

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/elizabethjacobs.bsky.social/post/3mduyzmexz22b"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-jacobs-1.jpg" width="550" height="531" alt="Jacobs @ BlueSky: ICE health care moves from 'patient care' to 'assessing alien fitness for deportation'" title="Jacobs @ BlueSky: ICE health care moves from 'patient care' to 'assessing alien fitness for deportation'" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

Note the change in future direction of ICE Health Services: from "direct patient care" to
"assessing alien's [sic] fitness to travel as they prepare for deportation".  As proof,
the original ICE Health Services statement is
[archived here](https://www.ice.gov/features/health-service-corps),
while the new one is [here](https://www.ice.gov/es/node/56783).  Read them and snapshot
them now, before ICE deletes the evidence, as is the custom of their tribe.  

This amounts to making sure people can _survive_ a deportation flight, so they will just
_die somewhere else._  Jacobs's comparison to [Mengele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mengele)
is not far off.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

RFKJr is determined, by his vaccine policies, to shoot himself in the foot with a giant
footgun.  The nature of public health being _public,_ this means he will shoot your foot
also.  ICE is just penning people up in horrific conditions, beating them, murdering some
of them, denying health care, and hoping an institutional pandemic will commit mass murder
for them.  

Republicans: Are you comfortable with that?  Because you _voted_ for that, as was clearly
stated in the campaign before the election last year.  

In the US, 1/3 voted against this, 1/3 voted for it, and 1/3 couldn't be bothered to
vote.  I'm not sure which of the last 2 categories bothers me more.

## Addendum 2026-Feb-10: Tuberculosis, Too?!  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-texas-1.jpg" width="400" height="264" alt="DeGuzman &amp; Kriel @ El Paso Matters: Now it's tuberculosis, too." title="DeGuzman &amp; Kriel @ El Paso Matters: Now it's tuberculosis, too." style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Apparently that was not enough.  Now comes a report that at an El Paso ICE detention
facility, there is both COVID-19 _and_ tuberculosis <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>:  

> Two cases of tuberculosis and 18 cases of COVID-19 were recently identified at Camp East
> Montana, according to El Paso city officials and Congresswoman Veronica Escobar.  

Of course, ICE is in full denial &amp; lying mode, as is the custom of their tribe:  

> Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, and other ICE
> spokespeople did not respond to detailed questions Saturday. More than 24 hours later,
> McLaughlin denied in a statement that tuberculosis cases are currently present at the
> tent camp.  

It turns out that they were&hellip; simply _moved_ to another camp, so their existence could be
denied.  This is the same detention center where (a) Geraldo Lunas Campos died after what
ICE called "experiencing medical distress", (b) which they then later claimed was a
suicide attempt, and (c) the El Paso medical examiner now rules was a homicide in which
ICE agents put too much pressure on his chest and suffocated him.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2026-02-02-ice-measles-amny-1.jpg" width="400" height="332" alt="Moses @ AMNY: ICE prisoners hidden on other floors in NYC, lies told in court" title="Moses @ AMNY: ICE prisoners hidden on other floors in NYC, lies told in court" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
This utter contempt for human life is like the New York City situation, when a court
ordered ICE to stop the inhumane conditions in a detention facility on the 10th floor of
26 Federal Plaza: inedible food, sleeping on concrete floors, so few toilets they're soaked
in sewage, and constant sickness.  ICE's response was&hellip; moving prisoners to another
floor, claiming that the court order only applied to the original
floor! <sup id="fn8a">[[8]](#fn8)</sup>  They then denied having done this.  

Of course they lie about it, both to a Congressman and to the court:  

> In a statement provided to amNewYork, Congressman Dan Goldman, a longtime critic of the
> courthouse detentions, condemned the revelation.  
>  
> “ICE is not only lying to the Court, but they are lying to me,” Goldman said.  

Look, just admit it: these are death camps.  They are _trying_ to make as many detainees
die as they can, short of actual executions.  Sewage, food infested with worms, no medical
care, and now a trifecta of COVID-19/measles/tuberculosis&hellip; these are simply killing
people.  

Depraved neglect at this level is simply murder.  

ICE employees must, in the future, be tried and face long prison terms if convicted.
