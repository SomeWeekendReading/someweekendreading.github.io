So&hellip; 15 days into COVID-19.  


## Still positive  

I'm still positive as of this morning, albeit with a faint line on the RAT test.  Fever
&amp; chills last night made it clear my body is still really unhappy.  I had a brief
window of negative testing after paxlovid, but then the rebound hit me and is still here.  

The Weekend Editrix has been symptomatic for about a week, but regularly testing
negative.  So she went to the doctor today and&hellip; tested positive.  So something was
wrong with either the tests she was using or how they were used.  Now we're in the "comedy
of errors" phase, trying to schedule a telemedicine visit for her to decide if she gets
paxlovid.  

The American healthcare system is absurdly expensive, but also needlessly cruel.
