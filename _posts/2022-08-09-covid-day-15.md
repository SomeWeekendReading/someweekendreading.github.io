So&hellip; 15 days into COVID-19.  


## Still positive  

I'm still positive as of this morning, albeit with a faint line on the RAT test.  Fever
&amp; chills last night made it clear my body is still really unhappy.  I had a brief
window of negative testing after paxlovid, but then the rebound hit me and is still here.  

The Weekend Editrix has been symptomatic for about a week, but regularly testing
negative.  So she went to the doctor today and&hellip; tested positive.  So something was
wrong with either the tests she was using or how they were used.  Now we're in the "comedy
of errors" phase, trying to schedule a telemedicine visit for her to decide if she gets
paxlovid.  

The American healthcare system is absurdly expensive, but also needlessly cruel.  


## Addendum 2022-Aug-09, afternoon  

We finally got past the medical front office staff, whose main function seems to be not
preventive health care, but to _prevent health care_ by playing medical masquerade.  We reached
somebody who would schedule a telemedicine appointment for the Weekend Editrix.  

Ten minutes later, talking to an extremely reasonable physician, she had a scrip for
paxlovid.  I honestly don't understand _why we make this so hard!_  The actual physician
part works just fine, it's everything else that's broken.  

A short sail in the Weekend Zeppelin later, I rappelled down a line into the pharmacy and
got the paxlovid.  A quick
[skyhook pickup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_surface-to-air_recovery_system)
later, we sailed homeward and gave her the first dose amid great relief.
