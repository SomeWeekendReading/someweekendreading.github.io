Today I voted.  You should too, if you're an eligible US voter.  

<img src="{{site.baseurl }}/images/2020-10-06-today-i-voted.png" width="300" height="150" alt="Today I Voted" title="Today I Voted" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
The anxiously-awaited mail-in ballot arrived via US Mail at 9:30am.  By 11:30am, it was
filled out, put in the ballot envelope, signed _exactly_ as requested, put in the mailer
envelope, then walked _past the Post Office_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1](#fn1)]</sup> to the town
clerk's drop-box, and therein deposited.  

Please don't vote Republican.  Not for any imaginable office, not under any conceivable
circumstance.  Also, please don't vote 3rd party: that's half a vote for Trump.  If you think he
needs to go &mdash; and you _should_ &mdash; then you know you have to vote for
Biden/Harris.  Just do it: [settle for Biden](https://www.settleforbiden.org/ "Settle for now... hound him once he's elected!").

I see from the Secretary of States' web page for my state that my ballot has been
received, signature checked, and accepted for counting.  So... that's done.  Now, as the
Weekend Editrix pointed out, we just have to worry about the _outcome_.

## Notes  

<a id="fn1">1</a>: Too much Republican mischief at the Post Office: [72% of the mail sorting machines removed "for cost savings" were in counties won by Clinton in the last election](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/postmaster-dejoy-sorting-machines-stripped-for-parts_n_5f6d71d5c5b64deddeeb9107), according to [a federal court finding](https://www.dropbox.com/s/jq05j72ptz598ad/gov.uscourts.waed.91975.81.0_1.pdf?dl=0).  So... it's _deliberate_.[â†©](#fn1a)
