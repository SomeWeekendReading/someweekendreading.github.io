Apparently, it's Memorial Day in the US.  Again.  Seems like this happens every year, or
something.   Here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend, we still have ambivalent feelings about it (as
is the custom of our tribe).  


## A Minor Holiday Less Appreciated, Like Music in a Minor Key  

Yes, Memorial Day is supposed to be a relatively minor incumbent in the American holiday
pantheon.  

But it's _really_ hard just to ignore it, so we've had a few things to say upon this
occasion in the past <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
here on this Crummy Little Blog That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR).  It's a holiday seemingly
about honoring war dead, but nowadays it seems to veer almost into
[a Molochian sacrificial worship](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/),
and validation of militarism, nationalism, and other Republican modes of
thought.  I remember back when Republican insanities were mere _inanities;_ I liked it
better back then.  

Just as
[we wrote in 2022]({{ site.baseurl }}/memorial-day-2022/#time-to-have-a-think-about-war-and-violence-in-the-us),
it still is a cause for rage and despair to watch our institutions quiver helplessly,
paralyzed by right-wing disinformation.  Why is Trump still free?  Why is the system _so_
susceptible to his never-ending attempts to throw sand in the gears to disrupt it?  Why do
Republicans want to end democracy?  Why can't we supply sufficient arms to Ukraine for
them to _win_ and be done?  Why can't we _cut off_ arms to Israel to force them to stop
the Gaza genocide?  Why are despicable people like
[Marjorie Taylor Greene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene), 
[Lauren Boebert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Boebert),
and [Matt Gaetz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz) allowed to be Congress's own
Buffoon Squad of white supremacy and ignorance?  (On the other hand, Henry Kissinger is no
longer among the living.  In a spirit of _de mortuis nihil nisi bonum_, let us hope that
his newfound moral perspective will let him grow into greater compassion.)  

The answer, of course, is that the cause is Republican blockades of nearly everything
worthwhile.  (That brings the question of why Democrats somehow get the blame?)  

As we [noted in 2023]({{ site.baseurl }}/memorial-day-2023/#the-origins-of-memorial-day), 
Memorial Day began as a Black tradition in Charleston, South Carolina:
- The now-free Black community reburied some Union soldiers killed in a prison camp into
  more honorable graves.  They decorated them, sang some hymns and had a picnic.  
- This so angered the racist whites that the moved the graves, replaced them with a
  monument to a Confederate general, and began decorating Confederate graves only.  
- This, in turn, incensed the Northerners to begin decorating their war dead as well.

That's the holiday that has come down to us: originating in a war of treason to defend
human slavery, a racist suppression of a Black holiday, and a reaction to that from the
rest of us.  It's a hard origin to contemplate!  

So today we contemplate our war dead and the possible death of our democracy, both pushed
into the grave by an anti-democratic minority who seem only to want war, authoritarianism,
and white supremacy.  

It's&hellip; too much to contemplate with equanimity.  


## Our Now-Annual Ritual  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-30-memorial-day-2022-lost-horizon-2.jpg" width="400" height="559" alt="James Hilton: 'Lost Horizon', 1933" title="James Hilton: 'Lost Horizon', 1933" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
<a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/lost-horizon-1937-ox0abm/"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-30-memorial-day-2022-lost-horizon-1.jpg" width="400" height="132" alt="PBS: 'Lost Horizon', 1937, directed by Frank Capra" title="PBS: 'Lost Horizon', 1937, directed by Frank Capra" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
With that burden being imposed, we've had an annual ritual of retreating into fantasy in a
psychological attempt at
[drawing down the moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drawing_down_the_Moon_(ritual)).
That is, engaging in a _fantasy_ which might motivate us to find ways of realizing bits of
the fantasy.  The fantasy in question is of a kind, peaceful community that protects and propagates
humanity's intellectual and spiritual patrimony.  It's good to be motivated about that.  

Our choice of escapist fantasy is, as always, James Hilton's 1933 novel
_Lost Horizon_ <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>, and Frank Capra's 1937 film
adaptation. <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  There are some unacceptable attitudes about
women and Asians which were common in the 1930s and require some effort to ignore now.
But that effort is well-rewarded: much of the point of the racist bits is to point out the
hero is _against_ racism, and how we should all struggle to rise above that.  

As we summarized the plot a couple years ago:  
> The plot is interesting, both as an allegory and as a directly & literally applicable
> warning to the present day. In the 1930s, a British diplomat in western India (modern
> Pakistan) helps some people escape a local revolution. However, their mysterious pilot
> secretly kidnaps them, flying to a remote mountain lamasery and valley in Tibet. There
> they discover they have been recruited to join a small society collecting the world’s
> art, music, literature, and scientific knowledge to withstand “the coming storm” – the
> fear of World War II that was already in the air in 1933.  

It's a good sample of utopian novels.  As an inveterate utopian dreamer, I hope it can
inspire in all of us, but especially in me, greater acts of kindness and 
[_tikkun olam._](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tikkun_olam)  We must make peace with the
fact that we must _make_ peace.  


## The Official _Chanson du Blog-Weekend_ for Memorial Day

No holiday is complete without a song.  

Herewith, the now-canonical _chanson du blog_ for Memorial Day, is William Stafford's poem
<sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup> about the power of spaces that are _not_ war monuments,
as sung by John Gorka <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>:

> This is the field where the battle did not happen,  
> where the unknown soldier did not die.  
> This is the field where grass joined hands,  
> where no monument stands,  
> and the only heroic thing is the sky.  
>  
> Birds fly here without any sound,  
> unfolding their wings across the open.  
> No people killed &ndash; or were killed &ndash; on this ground  
> hallowed by neglect and an air so tame  
> that people celebrate it by forgetting its name.  

_That_ is the sort of Memorial Day space I want: a space so peaceful, we forget its name.


## The Weekend Conclusion

Of course, that is not reality.  

Our reality is that Trump continually dishonors the country, himself, and everything else
he touches with his complete moral squalor.  I am frustrated to the point of incandescent
rage that the system is somehow so glacially slow and woefully impotent that it quivers
helplessly at the thought of restraining him.  

After he's imprisoned, we can think about becoming once again an honorable people.  Until
then, any such talk is just pretense.

Amusingly, this was the first in the series of "pocket books" (what we call paperbacks today) put out by MacMillan in the US.  So it's the first American paperback, ever.  

Also amusingly, I first read it in an old World War II "military edition" intended for soldiers on leave.  Putting one of the more famously and powerfully pacifist novels about escaping to a utopian paradise to avoid war?  Somebody thought it was a good idea to put _that_ in the hands of soldiers on break from fighting! It's either shockingly clueless or breathtakingly subversive. Hard to disapprove, either way.
