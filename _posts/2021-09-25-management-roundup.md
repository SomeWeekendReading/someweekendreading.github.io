Yes, discontent with the corporate system and rule by managers is a thing.  As are
the associated nightmares, and the corresponding fantasies of justice.  


## Still having work nightmares  

When I retired, I only semi-humorously asked somebody at
[Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/) how long it would take for the work-related
nightmares to go away.  Answers ranged from months&hellip; to years&hellip; to "not so far".
Empirically, it's been a year and a quarter for me, and they haven't stopped.  Slowed
down to once or twice a week, maybe.  

[Corporate life certainly had its discontents]({{ site.baseurl }}/tags/#CorporateLifeAndItsDiscontents). <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  And they were many!  I still remember the time they tried to impose "proper business attire" on scientists&hellip; as remarkable an instance of [wooden-headedness](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2004/5/15/29251/-) (in the sense of historian [Barbara Tuchman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_W._Tuchman)'s views) as I can imagine.  And I'm an imaginative guy.

So this video from Radiohead, "If You Say the Word" <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>,
captured a perfect revenge fantasy: 3 working class guys practicing humane catch &amp;
release.  The capture suits who have escaped out into the real world where they are pests,
and then release them into an urban office district (looks like City of London?) where
they are&hellip; _still_ pests, but for other reasons.  

Late stage capitalism.  Not my favorite.  

But European style social democracy and regulated capitalism will be an uphill battle for
the rest of my life, here in the US.  The bright side is that that "the rest of my life"
may not be especially long, so maybe everybody _else_ won't have to wait too long?
