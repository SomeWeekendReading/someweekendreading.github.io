So, are you wondering if it's worthwhile to bestir yourself to vote?


## Yes.  Yes, It Is.  

Unless, of course, you're a Republican.  Then you can definitely stay home.  That's more
or less your party's brand: elections are optional, authoritarians will decide for you.  I
mean, it's _policy:_ blatant gerrymandering, clearly illegal voter suppression,
intimidation with armed thugs at ballot boxes, attempted murder of politician's
families&hellip; they're authoritarian monsters.

They even say the quiet parts out loud now, like women shouldn't vote, and only
Republicans are legitimate.  Consider the explicit statement of the Republican
gubernatorial candidate in Wisconsin, as reported by Reid Epstein at the
_New York Times_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>.  Tim Michels, the Republican candidate for
governor said explicitly, publicly, emphatically, and for attribution:  

> Republicans will never lose another election in Wisconsin after I’m elected governor.  

So there you have it: a _promise_ to disregard votes if the gerrymandered Republican
legislature feels like it.  

Republicans are fond of saying "one man, one vote".  (And nowadays, "man" seems to be the
way they prefer it, since they're wobbly on women's right to vote at all.)  In this
case, they mean "one man, one vote, _one time_" &mdash; and then elections will be irrelevant
going forward.

For visual thinkers, consider this editorial cartoon by Jack Ohman at the _Sacramento
Bee_.  <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  With the attempted murder by hammer of Speaker
Pelosi's husband, the phrase "hammer time in America" is especially desperate.  
- Do you want thugs with bloody hammers?  Republicans are doing that _now._  
- Or do you want gavels, due process, and rule of law?  Then vote not only Democratic, but
  against _any and all_ Republicans.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Look it's simple:  

1. Vote.
2. Don't vote Republican.  Not for any imaginable office, not under any
   conceivable circumstance.  Never.  
3. The only force that can preserve democracy in the US is the Democrats.  So don't
   abstain or vote 3rd party, either.  That's half a vote for evil.  Don't support evil,
   not even halfway.  Vote for Democrats.
