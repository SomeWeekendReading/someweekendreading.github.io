I was going add to [the previous LLM sewage rant]({{ site.baseurl }}/llm-ai-still-crap/),
but&hellip; it's just too much!  


## Yet More BS Firehoses  

You'd think, at this point, there would be enough examples of LLM AIs making statements
wildly disconnected from reality that people would stop using them for anything beyond
amusement.  

You would be incorrect in that assessment.  

People are in fact going _the other way,_ increasing AI adoption.  Some of this appears to&
be at the behest of corporate management (usually lawyers or MBAs), who have no clue.
Less than a clue. _Negative_ clues.  

### Fit #10: Direct Self-Contradiction  

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/olufemiotaiwo.bsky.social/post/3lqcz65mstk2a"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-30-llm-ai-still-crap-addendum-apples-lycopene.jpg" width="300" height="726" alt="Olufemi Taiwo @ BlueSky: Apples both do and do *not* contain lycopene" title="Olufemi Taiwo @ BlueSky: Apples both do and do *not* contain lycopene" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Remember when I showed the example where [Google's AI couldn't decide if `defformat` was
part of CommonLisp]({{ site.baseurl }}/llm-ai-still-crap/#fit-1-a-query-about-the-commonlisp-language)?
Perhaps you thought "Oh, that's just some nerd thing, nothing do do with me."  

Before you contemptuously dismiss nerdy/neurodivergent experience, consider that we just
notice these things early, and supply warnings.  

Indeed, here is an example form Ol&uacute;f&eacute;mi T&aacute;&iacute;w&ograve; at
BlueSky.  [Lycopene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycopene) is a bright red hydrocarbon
of the carotenoid family, found in tomatoes and other vegetables.  It does seem to have
some mild anti-cancer effects, part of a diet high in fruits and vegetables.  It's a
reasonable question to ask, particularly by a cancer patient: given that some apples are
red (at least in their peels), whether apples contain lycopene.  

Behold, the results from the once-mighty Google, now a BS firehose: apples both _do_ and
_do not_ contain lycopene, as told by on the same page by _consecutive_ search results!  

I thought briefly about doing the research to find the correct answer.  But I gave up on
that since it was too NT a reaction: a normal person, confronted with this, would not do
proper research.  They'd pick the result they want to be true, and move on as though that
were the case.  In that sense, the contempt for truth shown in the modern search engines
is pushed onto normies.  

### Fit #11: Microsoft Copilot Borks Microsoft SharePoint Security  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/https://infosec.exchange/@paco/114509218709929701"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-30-llm-ai-still-crap-addendum-sharepoint.jpg" width="300" height="464" alt="Paco Hope @ Mastodon: Microsoft Copilot defeats security in Microsoft SharePoint" title="Paco Hope @ Mastodon: Microsoft Copilot defeats security in Microsoft SharePoint" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
There are 2 Microsoft things loose in the wild, much beloved by corporate managers:  
- [Microsoft SharePoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SharePoint) is an "enterprise
  content and document management system", which means it's basically a place for people
  to share files, data, etc.  It does a lot more than just a shared file server (surveys,
  collaboration, etc.), but that's the main thing.  
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Copilot) is an LLM AI from
  Microsoft that likes to get its nose in your business to "offer advice" (and take all
  your data for Microsoft's use).  It's based on GPT-4, and has all the limitations and
  hallucinations you'd expect.  
  
Now, obviously SharePoint has to have a security model.  Some documents are more
confidential than others, or are to be shared with limited audiences, and so on.  Also,
the ability to control and reprogram SharePoint itself is something you'd like to remain
only in trusted hands.  

Fair enough.  

But&hellip; as shown here in a Mastodon post by Paco Hope, you can "just ask Copilot" to
go do the thing you're forbidden from doing&hellip; and that's what will happen!  

Not only will it break security to show you what you're not supposed to see, it will do so
_bypassing security logs_ so nobody can tell you did that!  As you'll remember from our
post about [probable felonies committed by DOGE at the NLRB]({{ site.baseurl }}/bad-doggies/),
bypassing security logs is something only The Bad Guys do.  

Keep these 2 facts in mind:  
- It's nearly impossible to install Office 365 (Microsoft's standard business tools; this
  is all managers think computers do) without SharePoint.  
- It's nearly impossible to update Microsoft Windows without getting Copilot.  Disabling
  Copilot is reputed to be _difficult._

So Microsoft hands you SharePoint, on which you depend; Microsoft also hands you Copilot,
which eviscerates SharePoint security.  

And you can't get out of that!  

Pen Test Partners has published a slightly more in-depth view of the
problem. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  Basically, Microsoft has drilled a great,
gaping hole in their security.  

### Fit #12: RFK Jr's MAHA Report is AI-Written, Citing Non-Existent Sources  

Robert F Kennedy Jr is the US Secretary for Health and Human Services.  His "Make America
Healthy Again" (MAHA, meant to echo Trump's MAGA), pushes various conspiracy-fueled medical
theories instead of evidence-based medicine, especially vaccines.  He claims to they will
be using "gold standard" science.  (though his recent demand for clinical trials with
placebo control arms instead of standard of care shows that he has no idea what that
means.)  

The recently issued 
MAHA report](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WH-The-MAHA-Report-Assessment.pdf)
shows significant signs of having been AI-written, as well as pushing arrant nonsense.  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-05-30-llm-ai-still-crap-addendum-notus.jpg" width="400" height="655" alt="Kennard &amp; Manto @ NOTUS: MAHA shows AI-written tendencies, with 7 non-existent studies" title="Kennard &amp; Manto @ NOTUS: MAHA shows AI-written tendencies, with 7 non-existent studies" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;">
Investigations by Kennard &amp; Manto <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup> found several of the
references are simply broken links or lead to nonexistent DOIs.  At least 7 appear _not to
exist at all!_

In the meantime, they're burning to the ground the NSF and the NIH, substituting their
political preferences for scientific consensus on vaccines and gender-affirming care,
banning government publications in the very best academic journals, proposing to withdraw
insulin from diabetics and corticosteroids from asthmatics, and generally
disbanding scientific advisory boards in favor of presidential opinion.  

This will spread ignorance, misery, and death.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

LLM AIs are doing a gradient descent optimization in which they're optimizing for
_plausibility_, not truth.  They generate what a plausible continuation of a conversation
might look like, in some believable universe.  Not this universe.  Not a truthful
universe.  Just&hellip; something you might imagine, as in a dream.
