Yesterday was _also_ a good day: the FDA's external advisory committe passed the
Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at 5:20pm EST on 2020-Dec-17.  


## What's the sitch?  

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2020-12-18-moderna-vaccine-passes-vrbpac-review-statnews.jpg" width="400" height="452" alt="STAT News: FDA VRBPAC passes Moderna COVID-19 vaccine" title="STAT News: FDA VRBPAC passes Moderna COVID-19 vaccine" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"/>
Our first stop in these matters is with [_STAT News_](https://www.statnews.com/) to get a
summary of the situation.  In this case, they published a transcript of their
live-blogging of the hearings before the VRBPAC (Vaccines and Related Biological Products 
Committee).  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>

This is the same body as the one that recommended approval for the Pfizer vaccine, though
I note that here there are 21 members here _vs_ 22 for Pfizer.  A Venn diagram of the committee
members present might be interesting.  But the bottom line is: the vote was 20-0-1, i.e.,
20 in favor of the EUA, nobody against, and 1 abstention.  

In every crowd, there's always gotta be one, right?  In this case, it was Michael Kurilla,
director of clinical innovation at National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences in
the NIH.  He felt that EUA was a bit too much, and would have preferred what's called the
"expanded access protocol": basically open the clinical trial to people at high risk
(presumably the treatment arm, not the placebo?).  This would be sort of a half-step
toward EUA, to minimize risk in people who don't already have a high risk profile for
COVID-19, a very cautious position.  I wonder if he was also on the Pfizer committee, and
if so why he did not advocate this position there?  Still, he's not _against_ the Moderna
vaccine, just very, _very_ cautious.  So, it's not an unreasonable position, really.  

Interestingly, one of the committee members who voted _against_ the Pfizer vaccine last
week, voted _for_ the Moderna vaccine this week: A. Oveta Fuller (UMich microbiologist)
said she was impressed by Moderna's transparency, and that there was no attempt to extend
the age range downward to 16-17 year olds, as with Pfizer.  


## VRBPAC committee meeting  

<iframe width="373" height="210" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94OMGzrQzvQ" allow="accelerometer; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></iframe>
The question from the FDA before the committe was:  
- _Based on the totality of scientific evidence available, do the benefits of the Moderna
  Covid-19 vaccine outweigh its risks for use in individuals 18 years of age and older?_  
- __NB:__ The crucial differences with respect to Pfizer are that this is the _only_
  question before the commitee, and that Moderna applied for EUA for 18+ years old instead
  of 16+ as for Pfizer.  So there was considerably less discussion of side issues and no
  wrangling over pediatric application of a vaccine.  
  
_This committee approval is not the final step; the committee's report is a
**recommendation** to the FDA, not a binding decision._ There are times in the past when
the FDA has chosen to disregard the opinion of external scientists &amp; medical
pracitioners, but it's pretty rare.  It's _highly likely_ that the FDA will issue very
soon a formal EUA for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

It may take a day or two, barring political meddling, for the FDA to grant the official
EUA, but it's pretty likely to happen.  


## Issues that concerned VRBPAC members  

### Crossover design  

Steven Goodman, associate dean of clinical and translational research at Stanford,
suggested last week for Pfizer and again this week for Moderna that an EUA would be an
ethical challenge for those still on the trial, especially in the placebo arm.  he
proposed the trials continue in double-blinded fashion, but that the patients be called in for a
second treatment.  Without the administering clinician's knowing what the second treatment
was to be:  
- those in the treatment arm get 2 doses of placebo without being told what it was,
  and  
- those in the placebo arm get 2 doses of the vaccine without being told what it was.  

This would permit the trial to keep collecting double-blind data, but at the cost of
considerable complexity and money.  

Both Pfizer and Moderna rejected this, planning to unblind the trial and tell the
participants which arm they were in, as it would be too expensive to carry out Goodman's
suggestion, but unethical to keep the placebo arm participants in the dark.  They want to
vaccinate the subjects in the placebo arm.  The details are, alas, somewhat unclear and
probably differ between Moderna &amp; PFizer.  

It would have been nice if there had been adequate planning on the Federal level, to have
a common policy on unblinding, rather than haphazardly by company.  Nevertheless, here we
are.  


### Side effects  

Some of the data presented showed the Moderna vaccine was more reactogenic (showing strong
immune response, which is desirable, but also showing side effects like fever and soreness
in the very short term).  Indeed, 16% of pateints in the treatment arm showed Grade 3 side
effects (really annoying, likely to put you in bed, but not in the hospital).  

In particular, there were a couple cases of Bell's palsy, which is a temporary and partial
paralysis of facial muscles. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  It's not super-serious,
though annoying to those who get it.  And it does not appear to be statistically
significantly related to the vaccine.  

Also, some committee members noted anaphylaxis (allergic reaction leading sometimes to
shock) in a couple people receiving the Pfizer vaccine, and wanted to know what Moderna
had to say about it.  The FDA said both companies had to watch out for this, apparently
meaning watching people for 30-45min after injection with an epi-pen at the ready, or
something vaguely like that.  


### Unanswerable questions  

Nobody knows the answers to these questions:  
- Does the vaccine prevent virus transmission, or does it just make people asymptomatic
  carriers who can still transmit the virus?  
- Have there been any viral mutations to get around the vaccine?  (Unlikely, given the
  spike protein's architecture to bind to ACE2 is very specific, but it _could_
  happen&hellip;)  
- How did 11 participants who got the vaccine get COVID-19?  

Dunno.  But, as we start measuring both viral mRNA levels and antibody levels in
vaccinated participants, that will help.  Asymptomatic carriers will be positive on the
PCR test; sequencing any viral RNA found will tell us about mutations; and antibody levels
especially in those who got COVID anyway will tell us about vaccine response.  

But not yet.  


### Being asked the wrong question!  

Amusingly, when it came time to vote, the FDA put the wrong question on the screen: it was
about the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, instead of the Moderna vaccine.  

One can only _imagine_ the yelling that went on behind the scenes&hellip; though it was
quickly &amp; easily corrected.  


## Issues that did _not_ concern VRBPAC members: the cold chain  

Much better here: Pfizer's requires -70&deg;C freezers, whereas Moderna's can use ordinary
freezers, and keeps in an ordinary refrigerator up to 30 days.  

__Weekend Prediction:__ The Pfizer vaccine will mostly go to urban centers, where larger teaching
hospitals and the many research facilities have -70&deg;C freezer space they can donate or
lease.  The Moderna vaccine will go to less urban, more rural areas where the facilities
available are more basic.  


## Summary opinion  

James Hildreth, president of Meharry Medical College, an HBCU in the Nashville area:
> To go from having a sequence of a virus in January to having two vaccines available in December is a remarkable achievement.  

Hayley Gans, infectious disease specialist at Stanford:
> I think this is a really opportune time to move science forward, and I would say that the evidence &ndash; which has been studied in great detail &ndash; on this vaccine highly outweighs any issues that we’ve seen.  

Paul Offit, virologist at Children's in Philadelphia:
> The answer to that question is clearly yes.  The question is never when do you know everything. It’s when do you know enough.  

Amen to that.  


## FDA reaction

The FDA reaction was quick.  A statement from Hahn (FDA Commissioner) and Marks (director
of CBER) was issued <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>, saying they agree with the committee
and will work quickly toward an EUA:  

> Following today’s positive advisory committee meeting outcome regarding the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has informed the sponsor that it will __rapidly work toward finalization and issuance of an emergency use authorization.__ The agency has also notified the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Operation Warp Speed, so they can execute their plans for timely vaccine distribution.  


## Inevitably, the Republican clown car rolls up and excretes incompetence  

No good deed goes unpunished, and under Republican rule no good news goes
un-crapped-upon.

First up, in the venerable _Globe_, and article by Weisman &amp; Andersen reports that the
Federal government has reduced shipments of the Pfizer vaccine to Massachuesetts by 
1/3! <sup id="fn5a">[[5]](#fn5)</sup>  Several other states have also been throttled by
the Feds: New Hampshire, Connecticut, California, Illinois, Michigan, Washington, Georgia,
Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, Indiana, and Rhode Island.  

Inexplicably, but  sadly predictably, an HHS spokesperson denied any such reductions happened.

Second, a longer investigation by Lutz in _Vanity Fair_ <sup id="fn6a">[[6]](#fn6)</sup>
poses an interesting conundrum.  The Trump administration claims there are production
problems from Pfizer.  However, there are 2 inconvenient facts:  
- The Trump administration _failed to buy_ doses they were offered multiple times by
  Pfizer, and  
- Pfizer itself says they have no manufacturing problems, and literally have millions of
  doses in (no doubt very cold) warehouses, awaiting instructions and payment:  
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">

    Pfizer is not having any production issues with our COVID-19 vaccine, and no shipments
    containing the vaccine are on hold or delayed. The company’s statement can be found

## Added late-night 2020-Dec-18  

The FDA has formally granted the Emergency Use Authorization for the Moderna 
vaccine <sup id="fn7a">[[7]](#fn7)</sup>:  

> Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the second vaccine for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The emergency use authorization allows the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine to be distributed in the U.S. for use in individuals 18 years of age and older.

self-conscious about it for the months it persisted.  Any compliment from me probably would have
been _awkward!_ (Or maybe the opposite.  We'll never know.) It's definitely a disease that
is quite annoying to those who have it, even though it usually goes away in weeks to 
months. [↩](#fn3a)
