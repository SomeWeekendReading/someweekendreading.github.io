Japan has done a quantitatively _great_ job protecting Japanese citizens from COVID-19.
What can we learn from them (about this, and so many other things)?  


## A Report From Japan

He alterted us to a quick article in _Nature_ by Japanese virologist Hitoshi Oshitani of
Tohoku University. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-25-japan-covid-success-owid-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-25-japan-covid-success-owid-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="222" alt="Our World in Data: Weekly deaths/million population, US and Japan, 2020-Feb-18 to 2022-May-22" title="Our World in Data: Weekly deaths/million population, US and Japan, 2020-Feb-18 to 2022-May-22" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>

We needn't look very far to see why this is of import: consider as shown here the daily
COVID-19 deaths in the US and Japan, per million people.  It's corrected for population
size, so the 2 curves for the US and Japan show comparable risk rates in the 2 nations.
This is not a theoretical here here at Chez Weekend: in early 2020, the Weekend Editrix
was considering a trip to Japan but cancelled due to the pandemic.  In retrospect, we
should have done the opposite and evacuated both of us to Japan to be safer than in the
US.  It turned out ok for us in the US, since we were capable of rigidly isolating for a
period now going into a 3rd year.  

This is especially curious: Japan has one of the most elderly poplulations, tends to very
densely packed housing in cities, and has a legal structure that prohibits widespread
lockdowns or quarantines.  That _should_ have ignited a firestorm of COVID-19, but did
not, due to careful public health measures that saved lives.  

But it _itches:_ what should we have done differently?!  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-25-japan-covid-success-nature-2.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-05-25-japan-covid-success-nature-2-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="534" alt="Oshitani @ Nature: With Topol's highlighting" title="Oshitani @ Nature: With Topol's highlighting" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
Oshitani explains what Japan did.  Here's Topol's personally highlighted version of the
article (just 1 page), so you can see what an expert like Topol thought was important.
The lessons:  
- Study the situation carefully, so you know what's going on.  Then communicate truthful
  and useful information to citizens (e.g., transmission by aerosols, not surfaces).  
- Communicate simply and memorably.  In Japan it was the _sanmitsu_: the 3 C's (closed
  rooms, crowded conditions, and close contact; san means 3, and those 3 phrases all begin
  with "mi" in Japanese, so it was nicely alliterative).  _Sanmitsu_ (3密) is also a well-known phrase
  in Buddhism, referring to body/speech/mind of intelligent beings.  So it was all
  packaged properly by using a well-known phrase whose alliteration called to memory the
  things to avoid.  Well done!  
- Vaccinate _quickly and thoroughly_, getting everybody, starting with the most
  vulnerable.  Then get boosters.  Check ventilation in public buildings.  
- Have a well-funded, functional public health system.  Japan had many public health
  nurses across hundreds of centers, doing retrospective contact tracing for diseases like
  tuberculosis.  This was quickly vectored in the direction of COVID-19.  
- Most of all, in response to public health guidelines, Oshitani says:  

  > People largely complied.  

  They were not, as in the US, stupidly rebelling against their own interests based on
  superstition, disinformation, and inchoate rage like the American right wing.  

So basically they did all the sensible things, and communicated simply and truthfully.  The
Japanese people understood &amp; mostly executed good public health policy.  

We should go and do likewise in the future.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

Oshitani's conclusion (emphasis added):  

> Often, phrases such as 'exit strategy' or 'back to normal' are used by people longing
> for the days when we lived without the threat of this virus. __But we are nowhere near
> back to normal.__ Nations must continue to seek the best balance between suppressing
> transmission and maintaining social and economic activities. How? By using all the tools
> at hand as they apply to cultures, traditions, legal frameworks and existing practices,
> to __minimize suffering across the globe.__  

Yep.  That's my conclusion as well: we're _not_ back to normal yet, and we have a lot of
work to do to lower suffering world-wide.  

Whether we will _actually do that work_ is the moral test before us.
