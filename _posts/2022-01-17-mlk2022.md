Today in the US is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, when we honor the civil rights advocate who
pushed for rights for racial minorities and the poor, for which he was assassinated.  How
best should that honor be expressed?  


## Active Remembrance of an Activist

Martin Luther King Jr. was a major force in reshaping American politics in the 1960s to be
more humane and more just.  He was a pioneer in noviolent political action against violent
oppressive right-wing rule.

He inspired many to carry on that work, even in places as vile as South Africa under
apartheid.  One of my favorites is Walter Wink's _The Powers That Be_ <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>,
which reframed my religious life in a major way.  It really does realign spiritual
language in a way that, while not losing its original meaning, nonetheless allows one to
speak of institutional character and how to fight back against the powers of the world,
and indeed to reform them.  

It's more than an individual responsibility problem, it's a _systemic_ problem of racism
and inequality producing poverty and misery across American society.  Self-reliance is a
noble virture, but it cannot be used as a moral shield to shirk our mutual duty of care:  

>It is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he should lift himself up by his own
>bootstraps. It is even worse to tell a man to lift himself up by his own bootstraps when
>somebody is standing on the boot&hellip;. I had to tell him finally that nobody else in this
>country has lifted themselves by their own bootstraps alone, so why expect the black man
>to do it?   
>  
> &mdash; Martin Luther King Jr. (from "All Labor Has Dignity")  

It's in some ways unsurprising that the vicious and racist system King opposed ended up
assassinating him.  We then gradually lost ground over time, climaxing today: Republicans
have stacked the courts, gutted the Voting Rights Act, gerrymandered districts to entrench
white minority rule, and begun imposing draconian voting restrictions to suppress votes
from the minorities and the poor.  Now they have armed, violent mobs calling for the
overthrow of democracy itself.

How best to honor MLK amid the burning rubble of US civil rights?  The powers of
capitalism would have us believe a holiday mattress sale is an appropriate response.
However, we know better.  King's son had a diverging opinion, while speaking yesterday in
Arizona <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>:  

> The holiday is "not a traditional celebration where you kick back, eat barbeque
> and just relax," he said. "This is about working."  

Why is he in Arizona?  He and his family were Phoenix yesterday, speaking against Senator
Sinema's embrace of the filibuster. She and Senator Manchin have _de facto_ crippled the
Democratic bills to reinstate universal voting rights, and allowed the Republicans to
entomb us under generations of minority white rule:  

> "History will remember Sen. Sinema, I believe unkindly, for her position on the
> filibuster," the civil rights leader's eldest son said as the nation prepares to mark
> the birthday of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.  

How to celebrate his father's memorial?  There should be "no celebration without
legislation", since the Republican anti-voting measures are an existential threat to
not just minority rights under minority white rule, but to American democracy more
broadly.  So that's one way he's working: exerting political pressure on Sinema not to be
the one holding back the cause of human rights in the US.

He spoke at Eastlake Park, where Black families gathered when racism made them unwelcome at other
parks in the Phoenix area.

Even in Arizona today, for example, Senator Sinema's home state: it is now _illegal_ to
give a bottle of water to someone waiting in line to vote in the hot Arizona sun.  Yes,
that's stupid.  Yes, that's racist and a vile prejudice against the poor.  Yes, that's
cruel. Apparently, _cruelty is the point_ of Republican policies, as Adam Serwer pointed
out in _The Atlantic_ a couple years back. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>

Even the _Wall Street Journal_, usually a conservative bastion of every defense of the
status quo that can enable the rich to get richer, has an article on King today (click to
embiggen, to see the lovely AP photo of the MLK memorial in DC in 
snow). <sup id="fn4a">[[4]](#fn4)</sup>  Usually they're the coat-holders and enablers of
the foot-draggers who prevent any sort of progress that does not enrich their masters.
Today they write vaguely favorably of King and the march happening today in DC.  But in
doing so, given their history, they thereby becoming unknowing object illustrations of de
la Rochefoucauld:  

> L'hypocrisie est un hommage que le vice rend &agrave; la vertu. (Hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue.)  
> &mdash; [Fran&ccedil;ois VI, Duc de la Rochefoucauld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_de_La_Rochefoucauld_(writer)), _Reflexions Ou Sentences Et Maximes Morales De Rochefoucauld_

It's hard to understand how anybody can support anti-democratic institutions like the
filibuster, with its racist history.  The video here shows MLK himself explaining the
anti-democrtic nature of the filibuster, back in the day (1965-Jul-05).  Our moral
progress is slowed to the speed of the worst foot-dragging Senator.  

Whether Manchin or Sinema is the more vile, well&hellip; that's open to debate.  Having a
backup "Worst Senator" is not a good thing.  

I wish I understood better what to do about any of this.
