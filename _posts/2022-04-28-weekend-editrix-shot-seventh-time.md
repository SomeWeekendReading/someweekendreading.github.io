Today the Weekend Editrix got shot for the 7th time in the trailing 12 months, having gotten
her 2nd booster for COVID-19.  


## 2nd boosters seem to work pretty well, so&hellip;

Your humble Weekend Editor
[got his 2nd booster a few weeks ago]({{ site.baseurl }}/today-i-got-shot-a-seventh-time/).
Today the Weekend Editrix, having returned from Japan and de-jet-lagged a bit, got hers.  

Herewith the now-canonical jab shot.  

Expecting innate immune system reactions tomorrow (fever, fatigue, etc.).  Also expecting
very little chance of COVID-19 death as the future unrolls.  It's a good trade!  


## Celebratory lunch

In order to celebrate her boosting, and for that matter safe return from Japan, we went
out for sushi.  In fact, [conveyor belt sushi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt_sushi),
with robot table service.  Any special orders arrive at your table via the high-speed
conveyor belt at the top; the lower speed conveyor belt shows you all sorts of goodies
which you just grab as they go by.  A tablet above all this lets you make special orders
or drinks; the drinks are delivered by robot.  You can also give the robot any waste, like
paper wrappers of various sorts.

(Yes, I ordered a glass of ice water just to photograph the robot.  No, it did not cost any
extra.  Yes, I drank the ice water.  Don't judge me.)  

It was remarkably free from human interaction other than of the Editor/Editrix sort.  That
includes ordering specials, counting plates, and checkout using a smartphone.  Appropriate
for a pandemic, even if it's (possibly) in its final phases.
([Leonhardt was right]({{ site.baseurl }}/lessons-vs-another-booster/#what-have-we-learned):
the 'very liberal' are worried about COVID-19, and I am very liberal.  But he was also wrong,
in that our worry is not unfounded.)  The staff were masked; the patrons largely were not.  

Among other things:  
- I made the tactical error of ordering a side dish sized bowl of ramen.  "Ramen in a
  sushi place?!" you ask&hellip; and I accept the reprimand.  The broth was pretty good,
  the noodles a little weird, and the soft-boiled egg and chashu a little cold in the
  center.  Clearly assembled from pre-prepared ingredients.  Acceptable, though not worth
  the effort to go there.  
- The Weekend Editrix judged the _hokkaido kaibashira_ (scallops from Hokkaido) to be very
  good indeed.  
- The squid was pretty good, and all the rest was at least reasonably good and fun to pick
  out.  
- The _taiyaki_ dessert (vanilla ice cream plus sweet bean paste inside a fish-shaped pastry) was
  a mistake.  The fish-shaped pastry is supposed to be _baked_ around the sweet bean paste in
  something like a waffle iron; some clown decided to deep-fry it instead, with extra
  grease.  Definitely a mistake.  
  
Oh, and you still have to tip, despite the lack of humans delivering food to your table.
It apparently goes to the staff as a whole.  _Somebody_ cleans off the table, loads up the
robot, puts together the sushi, fills the conveyor belt, etc.  

Still, it was fun and we'll go back.  We're still working through the process of lowering
our pandemic defenses.
