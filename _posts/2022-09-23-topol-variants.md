Tired of COVID-19?  Me too.  But&hellip; apparently the SARS-CoV2 virus is not yet tired of _us!_


## Yet More Variants  

From the indispensable Eric Topol, of
[the Scripps Research Translational Institute](https://www.scripps.edu/science-and-medicine/translational-institute/),
comes some timely if unwelcome news about variants and convergent evolution of the
COVID-19 causing virus SARS-CoV2:

He's quoting the nowcast data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
COVID-19 Data Tracker. <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup>  We're looking at the variants of
concern (VoC's) as of the first week of 2022-Sep, reproduced here.  

Now, there's a lot to say about these data.  However, for me (and apparently for Topol)
the important bit is
the recent change in proportions of infections by the various variants:
- When you look back at mid-summer in the US, the main variants were Omicron/BA.4 and
  Omicron/BA.5.  Really, mostly BA.5 &ndash; probably the variant that we caught here at
  Chez Weekend this summer.  The rest of all the variants were being outcompeted, and vanishing.  
- Then we saw Omicron/BA.5 outcompete Omicron/BA.4, to become the dominant strain.  
- But now look at the last few weeks: Omicron/BA.5 is itself being outcompeted by
  something even more vicious!  It looks like Omicron/BA.4.6 is on the rise, slowly taking
  over.  
- The table on the right gives the quantitative proportions of each VoC, along with the
  95% confidence intervals for telling us the uncertainty.   

Yes, it doesn't look like much&hellip; _now._  That's how exponential growth works:
nothing, nothing, nothing much, not _really_ important yet, &hellip; and suddenly&hellip; _yow!_  

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-09-23-topol-variants-lineage-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2022-09-23-topol-variants-lineage-1-thumb.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="SARS-CoV2 lineage: 'convergent evolution on steroids'" title="SARS-CoV2 lineage: 'convergent evolution on steroids'" style="float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;"></a>
So where did this Omicron/BA.4.6 monster come from?  For that, we consult virology
professor Marc Johnson, who collected the evolutionary lineage data shown here, as a
directed acyclic graph.  

The Omicron/BA.2 root at the right is where all this Omicron variant nastiness started.
(OK, there were others like BA.1, but they didn't amount to as much.)  As you move to the
right in the diagram, the spike protein acquires more mutations, noted on each arrow in
[the usual amino acid substitution notation](https://www.hgmd.cf.ac.uk/docs/mut_nom.html).
The result is a directed acyclic graph, because the variants each contain a subset of the
accumulated mutations (hence a subgraph of the subset DAG).  

So we see that Omicron/BA.4.6 is just Omicron/BA.4 with an additional R346T amino acid
substitution.  

It still amazes me, after all these years, that this is all it takes: just a little tweak,
and suddenly you have a more aggressive virus.  Biology is weird.  

This diagram also warns us that Omicron/BF.7 and Omicron/BE.1.2 are in the same vicinity,
mutation-wise, and it's worth keeping an eye on them.  Omicron/BF.7 is in the CDC data
above, albeit at low levels, but growing.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

No, it's not over.  

As soon as we've cleared the 2-3 month interval from our summer COVID-19, we're getting
the bivalent booster here at Ch&acirc;teau Weekend.  Let's hope the BA.4-5 spike mRNA is
homologous enough to BA.4.6 to grant further immunity!  

Happy autumnal equinox, I guess&hellip;
