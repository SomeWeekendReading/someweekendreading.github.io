Today your humble Weekend Editor finally tested positive for COVID-19.  _Sigh._  


## The Evidence  

Last Saturday, I ventured forth from Ch&acirc;teau Weekend to have lunch with a friend
visiting from out of town.  I've only done that maybe twice in the last 2 1/2 years, so
this is not exactly a frequently-taken risk.  

And yes, _I wore a mask_ even though it seemed nobody else did.  "COVID's over!", they all
seem to think.  Yeah, right.  Sure, kid.  Whatever you say.  

However, the north part of Boston's MBTA Red Line was shut down completely for
track/signal work, and so they shoved people onto crowded shuttle buses for an hour's trip
that would have been 15min by train.  There, mask or no, I was in close quarters with many
young people apparently so convinced of their invulnerability that they felt no need to
mask.  

All it would have taken was the slightest slip of my mask, or even just a virus laden
droplet drifting into my eye.  

Apparently, that's what happened: Late Sunday afternoon, I started feeling achy and tired.
By evening, I was running 1.5&deg;C fever.  This morning, it was 2.1&deg;C and even more aches.

With a sense of dread, I took the test, whose results you can see here.  Your humble
Weekend Editor [definitely has COVID-19]({{ site.baseurl }}/weekend-editrix-exposed/), at long last.  

"Serves him right", some of you are probably thinking, "for hectoring us about
vaccinations and masking for 2 1/2 years!"  

Well, go ahead and think that if you like.  It was still the right thing to do.  I got
infected (apparently) because a random rail accident forced me onto a crowded shuttle bus full of
unmasked young folk, whereupon even the slightest slip on my part was enough for
Omicron/BA.5 (presumably) to take up residence.  


## The American healthcare double-bind  

Now, to deal with the inherent cruelties of the American healthcare system.  The doctors
and nurses all seem quite compassionate and motivated, but the insurance, hospital, and
practice bureaucracies are cruel.  

See, we had to switch physicians.  Our old one retired, so good for her.  The new one,
recommended by a friend in our religious community, couldn't schedule us for new patient
visits for 4 months.  During that interval, our prescriptions would of course run out.
The new doctor couldn't prescribe, because she hasn't seen us; the old doctor can't
prescribe because she is retired.  

Eventually we got a nurse practitioner in the old doctor's practice to write a "bridge
prescription" until we could get in to see the new doctor.  My new patient visit was to be
this Wednesday.  

But now, with COVID-19, the new doctor can't see me.  She can't write prescription
renewals and can't prescribe paxlovid, _because_ she hasn't seen me.  The old doctor is
long gone, and the staff of that practice is now dispersed.  

So&hellip; what to do?!  


## Sense and sensibility  

Sometimes I'm fond of telling people, ["Are you gonna break the rules, or are the rules
gonna break you?"]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#your-humble-weekend-editor)  

So I was pleased when the new doctor's staff, with eminent sensibility at a pleasantly
surprising level, suggested:  
- A telehealth visit today with a nurse practitioner to evaluate me for paxlovid, and
- A telehealth visit later with the doctor herself to establish care and allow her to
  renew existing prescriptions, so the new patient visit can be delayed (probably for
  months, alas).  
  
We'll see how that goes.  


## Paxlovid interview  

I _like_ nurse practitioners.  Every encounter I've had with one has been sensible, calm,
and straightforwardly guided to a solution.  A good doctor is great, but doctors in
general seem to be more of a mixed bag.  But if you have a somewhat straightforward
problem with a somewhat straightforward solution, and just need someone to _do_ it&hellip;
NP's are your best friends.  

And so it was here.  She (and it's almost always a woman, for no obvious reason) was very
friendly, clear, and drove straight to the point.  She figured out that I already knew a fair
bit about paxlovid, so we could get through the medication interaction warnings and so on
pretty quickly.  She sent a prescription to my neighborhood pharmacy, and said it would be
there "momentarily".  

The Weekend Editrix said she'd pick it up after her lunch.  

I also got notification that my doctor's appointment could be made virtual, to formally
establish care, so she could then renew prescriptions.  

So far &ndash; pending actually getting my claws into a box of paxlovid &ndash; this is
looking like a success story all around.  The new doctor appears to have a very practical,
functional practice, and the nurse practitioner was as awesome as I'd hoped.

All right, then: after a quick sail in the Weekend Zeppelin, the Weekend Editrix brought
home a box of [paxlovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir), shown
here.  (Zero charge, even, with our insurance.)  I looked at this with approximately the
level of anticipation of a 5-year old seeing a box containing a holiday present!  (Now,
now: don't judge me.)  

It comes with the usual package insert full of a huge
amount of tiny, tiny type explaining various things in technical gobbledygook and warning
of dire consequences if&hellip; _something-something_.  This is, of course, read by
absolutely no one, being there mostly as a legal behind-covering move.  (I'm only showing
1 of 2 big pages here, but it doesn't matter since neither of us is going to read it, right?)  

Inside there are 5 blister packs, divided into morning and evening doses.  Each dose is 2
[nirmatrelvir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirmatrelvir) (the inhibitor of the viral
"main protease" required for viral reproduction) and 1
[ritonavir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir) (which inhibits
[CYP3A4/P450-3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4), the liver
enzyme which would ordinarily break down nirmatrelvir).  

Ok, it's now 3pm on the first day of testing positive.  That's close enough to "evening"
for me.  First dose down!  
- The ritonavir tab is nondescript white.  The nirmatrelvir tab, amusingly enough, is pink
  with "3CL" embossed on it.  The other name for the main protease ("Mpro") target, is the
  3C-like protease ("3CL-pro").  Not many drugs are embossed with the name of the molecule
  they target!  (On the other side of the pill, they embossed "PFE", the stock ticker
  symbol for Pfizer.  Sigh.)  
- The taste is&hellip; nothing I particularly want to remember.  I'm going to be having a
  metallic taste in my mouth for the next 5 days&hellip; and I'll be _grateful_ for that!  
  

## The Weekend Conclusion  
  
Getting COVID-19 is a failure, probably because I was insufficiently pessimistic about
getting on a crowded shuttle bus on Saturday.  

But getting COVID-19 treatment _fast,_ has thus far been a success.
