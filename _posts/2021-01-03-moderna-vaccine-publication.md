On 2020-Dec-30, the formal scientific publication of the Moderna's COVID-19 Phase 3 trail
in the prestigious _New Englad Journal of Medicine_ dropped into public view.  It's good.

The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is clinical trial 
[NCT04470427](https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04470427).  

It has now been formally peer reviewed and is published in the prestigious _NEJM_. <sup
id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> The results confirm a vaccine efficacy (VE) result of 94.1%
(95% CL: 89.3% &ndash; 96.8%).  The supplement to the paper tells us that they calculated
the VE very properly using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model, in which the
probability ratio becomes a Hazard ratio, to account for trial censorship.  

The efficacy in subgroups is [exactly as we found in Figure 7 of the FDA submission]({{ site.baseurl }}/beautiful-vaccines-2/#fine-but-whats-in-those-briefing-documents): 
pretty good all-around, with some wider error bars in the very elderly.  

This result is, as anticipated, very good indeed.  There's of course a lot more in the
paper, including some lovely stuff about 
[intent-to-treat _vs_ as-treated doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intention-to-treat_analysis),
and all the usual stuff.  But the top-line result of 94% efficacy is what we all want to see.
