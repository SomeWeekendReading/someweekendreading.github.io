The Bad Doggies are at it again, exfiltrating the Social Security data of about 450
million Americans, living and dead.  Great times for identity thieves.  Not so great for
everybody else.  


## VERY Bad Doggies  

Remember back in ancient times, like last April, when we wrote on this Crummy Little Blog
That Nobody Reads (CLBTNR) about the DOGE boys being bad little doggies for 
[apparently illegally exfiltrating NLRB data while turning off safeguards like logging &amp; access controls]({{ site.baseurl }}/bad-doggies/)?

Well, buckle up.  It seems they're now committing similar likely crimes at the Social
Security Administration.  This time, instead of just getting confidential info on NLRB
court cases against Musk and cronies, they've gotten identity information on all
Americans.  <sup id="fn1a">[[1]](#fn1)</sup> <sup id="fn2a">[[2]](#fn2)</sup>  

And by "all", I mean living _and_ dead, back to the dawn of Social Security.  

The whistleblower here is no low-level stooge.  It is, in fact, the Chief Data Officer of
the Social Security Administration, Charles Borges.  
- He reported internally to the (MAGA/DOGE) management of the SSA that the "Numident"
  (numerical identification system) database had been uploaded in its entirety to an
  unsecured cloud server by DOGE boys.  
- This database contains names, Social Security numbers, places and dates of birth,
  citizenship, race, ethnicity, address and even parents names.  
- This applies to _anyone who has ever had a Social Security number_, whether currently
  alive or dead.  
- This seems to work out to about 450 million people who now have their identities
  completely exposed to identity fraud risk.  
- It appears that the new senior MAGA/DOGE management of SSA actually approved this, even
  though it is widely believed to have been highly illegal, e.g., under the 
  Federal Information Security Modernization Act (according to Borges).  
- When internal appeals did not work, he made a formal whistleblower complaint to the
  Government Accountability Project. <sup id="fn3a">[[3]](#fn3)</sup>  That complaint was
  then forwarded to members of Congress and the US Office of Special Counsel.  

From the complaint:  

> This vulnerable cloud environment is effectively a live copy of the entire country's
> Social Security information from the Numerical Identification System (NUMIDENT)
> database, that apparently lacks any security oversight from SSA or tracking to determine
> who is accessing or has accessed the copy of this data. NUMIDENT contains all data
> submitted in an application for a United States Social Security card—including the name
> of the applicant, place and date of birth, citizenship, race and ethnicity, parents'
> names and social security numbers, phone number, address, and other personal
> information. Should bad actors gain access to this cloud environment, Americans may be
> susceptible to widespread identity theft, may lose vital healthcare and food benefits,
> and the government may be responsible for re-issuing every American a new Social
> Security Number at great cost.  

It's bad enough that DOGE got access to the data, which they _definitely_ should not
have.  But even worse that they just&hellip; _took_ it and put it on a cloud server with
no security and no logging to tell what they do with it.  

In response, new SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano denied that anything was insecure, that
it was all "walled off from the internet".  We've previously written about
[who Frank Bisignano is]({{ site.baseurl }}/soc-sec-journey/#:~:text=Ok%2C%20so%20who%20is%20this%20Frank%20Bisignano%20guy%3F),
namely a Wall Street investment banker, formerly the highest-paid CEO in the US, who used
layoffs as a constant threat against employees.  He's also a long-time Republican donor,
in particular to Trump.  

Do you really want to take _his_ word on computer security issues?  

I do _not._  

You can probably imagine what happened next: management retaliation.  SSA people were
instructed not to talk to Borges, which of course cripples his ability to do his job
legally and ethically.  

Journalist Marisa Kabas (and founder of [The Handbasket](https://www.thehandbasket.co/)
reported today that Borges has resigned, and supplies a copy of his letter of forced
resignation:  
<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3lxkryweisk2e"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-29-bad-doggies-redux-resignation-1.jpg" width="550" height="967" alt="Kabas @ BlueSky: Borges submits forced resignation; email later disappears from inboxes" title="Kabas @ BlueSky: Borges submits forced resignation; email later disappears from inboxes" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

As you can see, he says he's forced out due to management retaliation making it impossible
to perform his job "legally and ethically".  Management retaliation against whistleblowers
of this sort [_is a federal crime, according to the Office of the Inspector General._](https://oig.justice.gov/hotline/whistleblower-protection#:~:text=It%20is%20unlawful%20for%20any,complaint%2C%20under%20the%20guidelines%20below.)  

But it appears that lawlessness is no barrier to MAGA/DOGE, since it seems they
immediately violated federal record-keeping laws by attempting to delete all record of
this email from the inboxes of all who received it, according to Kabas:  

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marisakabas.bsky.social/post/3lxksh7xwnk2e"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2025-08-29-bad-doggies-redux-resignation-2.jpg" width="550" height="290" alt="Kabas @ BlueSky: Borges resignation mysteriously disappeared from inboxes minutes later" title="Kabas @ BlueSky: Borges resignation mysteriously disappeared from inboxes minutes later" style="margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000; margin: 0 auto; display: block;"></a>

I'm not a lawyer, but&hellip; it just looks like federal crime after federal crime
committed by these guys: unlawful data exfiltration, whistleblower retaliation, destruction
of federal records&hellip;  Sometimes the coverup is worse than the original crime.  


## The Weekend Conclusion  

I know dog training has progressed beyond the "swat 'em on the nose with a rolled-up
newspaper" doctrine of my youth.  Very few newspapers left, for one thing.  But I kinda
_do_ wanna swat these ignorant fascists on the nose with a rolled-up newspaper.  

I'd of course settle for a change of government, mass prosecutions, convictions, and
imprisonments.  That would be much better.  

Say it along with me:  [_Ceterum censeo, Trump incarcerandam esse._]({{ site.baseurl }}/ceterum-censeo/)
