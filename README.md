# This is the data for an obscure blog of an even more obscure retired scientist  

[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) automatically builds it into a static site.  It
lets me write posts locally in Emacs, push up to GitHub as a content management system,
and then have the site rebuilt -- static, with no cockroach-like infestations of awful, intrusive
Javascript nonsense for nefarious "business purposes" by shadowy corporate oligarchs.  

It was started in the summer of 2020, so obviously I'm still just learning what's going on
here.  Probably lots of Jekyll/Github blunders!
