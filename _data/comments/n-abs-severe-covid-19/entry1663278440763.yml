message: "Oooh&hellip; that _is_ interesting, thanks!  \r\n\r\nOf course having multiple targets is a well-known strategy for coping with resistance mutation.  That's one reason for combination therapies and multi-targeting antibodies in modern cancer therapy, for example.  \r\n\r\nI have a little trouble with the nucleocapsid protein as a target though: being inside the viral envelope, it's only visible _after_ infecting a cell.  \r\n\r\nStill, I'm eager to dive into the article and whatever papers are behind it.  Thanks for the pointer."
