  attending a community meeting, enrolling in public safety training courses, or
  joining an email list for neighborhood development updates. There is always
  something special waiting for you in the mailbox, right? If you're lucky, it's
  just a coupon for your favorite fast food place. However, sometimes this
  little card will be your secret to free food! <a

  of companies that offer free samples in the mail to select customers. Some
  companies will send you a full-sized product to try out and see if you like
