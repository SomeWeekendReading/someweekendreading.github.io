message: ">BTW: I believe _The Righteous Mind_ is the most important book I've read this century.  \r\n\r\nOr&hellip; even this millennium!  \r\nYes, it's undoubtedly a very important book!  I have slightly mixed feelings about it though:\r\n\r\n- On the one hand, his stuff about the \"rationalist delusion\" just drives me nuts!\r\n\r\n  It gets used as an excuse to avoid the hard work of learning to think clearly.  Yes, people wallow in the swamp of feelings and tribal affiliation.  No, that's no excuse for remaining there.\r\n- On the other hand, who can resist applauding the use of factor analysis in social science?  \r\n\r\n  Ever since Steve Hanks (remember him?) pushed me into learning singular value decomposition, my career took a sharp upward turn.  I got into a lot more machine learning in R, and wondered why _everybody_ didn't use SVD or eigenfactor methods to uncover the \"real\" variables in their data, to build good supervised classifier models under crossvalidation.  \r\n\r\n  (Then I tried explaining SVD to biologists at work, studying gene expression datasets.  I've never met such _fierce_ resistance!  Eventually I learned to say I used machine learning to \"uncover underlying variables\" without showing any math.  To my great disappointment, that worked.)  \r\n\r\nSo, yeah: I'm impatient with Haidt's helplessness in the face of irrationality, but applaud his use of (reasonably) modern statistical methods to find underlying factors in moral thinking.  \r\n\r\n(Though I wish _The Righteous Mind_ had included some math!  I admit this is a niche preference. :-)  \r\n\r\nThanks for stopping by &ndash; sometimes I worry nobody reads this stuff."
