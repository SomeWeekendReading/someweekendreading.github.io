message: "Welcome to the commentariat, Prism!\r\n\r\nOddly enough, a medical friend read this post and reminded me that while the gold standard is a PCR test, the silver standard is to use a [lateral flow test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_flow_test) like this one, but insisting on 2 negative results 24hr apart.  \r\n\r\nSo your suggestion turns out to be the standard of practice.  \r\n\r\nIf, as you worked out, the 2 consecutive tests were independent events (probabilistically), then the NOV of the pair would be the square of the NOV of a single test: 10.6% squared is about 1%.  \r\n\r\nHowever, as you also began working out, it's unlikely the tests are completely independent.  They might share a common failure mode, or share a common blindness to a viral variant, or share a common ham-fisted blunderer administering the test (me).  I don't know quite how to quantify that, so I might just say the chance of COVID-19 given a 2nd negative test would be lower than 10%, but bigger than 1%."
