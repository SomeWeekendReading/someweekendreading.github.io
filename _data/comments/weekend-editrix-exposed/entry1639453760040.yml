message: "Relieved to hear the test was negative!\r\n\r\nBut doesn't your 89.4% calculation only go through if we assume the base rate of illness relevant to Editrix (aka the prior Pr (Reality+)) is the same as the base rate of sick people in the trial for the test?\r\n\r\nThat seems unlikely to be exactly right as the value for Pr(Reality+).  I would think the actual correct prior would be something like the attack rate of the virus for a contact like the one that prompted the test.  (I'd expect that to be quite low--the within-household attack rate measured from contact tracing was about 20% when I looked it up pre-vaccination, this should be raised due to Delta no doubt, but also lowered due to vaccination, and this wasn't a within-household contact... so on the whole I would think the prior ought to be 20% or lower.)\r\n\r\nWhich is good news, by the way.  It would mean NPV=TN/(TN - FN) is something more like 1/(1-0.2*0.07)... since 0.2*0.07 is about the proportion of false negatives you would expect with a base rate of 20%... which is much better than 89.4%!\r\n\r\nAnd of course the false negative probability isn't really literally 100.0%; that should be modified down depending on the error bars from the trial, whatever those were."
