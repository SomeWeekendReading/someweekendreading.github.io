message: "First things first, Dave: welcome to the commentariat, and thanks for the kind wishes!  \r\n\r\n> But doesn’t your 89.4% calculation only go through if we assume the base rate of illness\r\n> relevant to Editrix (aka the prior Pr (Reality+)) is the same as the base rate of sick people\r\n> in the trial for the test?  \r\n\r\nNo, that's not quite how this works.  \r\n\r\nYou are thinking, possibly, of the vaccine trials?  There, the efficacy readout was at bottom a\r\ncomparison between the _rate_ of infection in the vaccine arm vs the _base rate_ of infection\r\nin the general population as represented by the control arm.  So knowing the base rate, as\r\nmeasured by the controls, was essential.  \r\n\r\nHere, though, we're not comparing _rates_, just the status of the next sample.  In the assay\r\ntrial, we want to know how often the assay is right and wrong (and which way it's wrong), when\r\npresented with a number of people of known COVID-19 status.  In this case, the assay was tested\r\non 108 sick people and 64 healthy people.  The background rate in the population doesn't matter\r\nso much; we assume that all COVID-19 patients are similar enough at the molecular level that\r\nthe assay will come out the same (plus noise, which models the error rate).  \r\n\r\nInterestingly, that will not remain the case over time: COVID-19 patients will change at the\r\nmolecular level due to new viral variants.  So the assays are usually optimized to be sensitive\r\nto _several_ spots on the relevant viral proteins.  That way the virus must mutate massively to\r\nevade detection&hellip; which, alas, seems to be what Omicron has done.  That's the source of\r\nSGTF: PCR tests measure several genes, but if the primers for the spike gene (S) fail due to\r\nmassive mutations in Omicron and the other genes show up, then you're looking at Omicron.  \r\n\r\nBut I'm glad you raised the issue.  It sure seems like _some_ background rate should matter,\r\ndoesn't it?  Your question parallels a criticism lobbed in my general direction by another\r\ncolleague who is unaccountably shy to use the comment system: he says I've invoked Bayes Rule\r\ntalismanically, without explicitly using it.  \r\n\r\nWhile that's a bit of an extreme view, let me here use Bayes explicitly for him and also so you\r\ncan see what the relevant background rate is.  \r\n\r\nWe want to calculate the Positive Predictive Value, when what we know are the assay parameters\r\nlike TPR, FNR, TNR, FPR (see graphic above):  \r\n\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{align*}\r\nPPV &= Pr(R+ | T+) \\\\\r\n    &= \\frac{ Pr(T+ | R+) \\times Pr(R+)}{ Pr(T+) } \\\\\r\n    &= \\frac{ Pr(T+ | R+) \\times Pr(R+)}{ Pr(T+ | R+) \\times Pr(R+) + Pr(T+ | R-) \\times Pr(R-) } \\\\\r\n    &= \\frac{TPR \\times Pr(R+)}{ TPR \\times Pr(R+) + FPR \\times Pr(R-) }\r\n\\end{align*}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nLooking at the 2x2 table above, or even the definitions written in the margin, we see the\r\nquantities we need:  \r\n\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{align*}\r\nTPR    &= \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} \\\\\r\nFPR    &= \\frac{FP}{FP + TN} \\\\\r\nPr(R+) &= \\frac{TP + FN}{N}  \\\\\r\nPr(R-) &= \\frac{FP + TN}{N}\r\n\\end{align*}\r\n$$\r\n\r\nHere the $\\Pr(R\\pm)$ is the rate in the test population, not the population at large.  Unlike\r\nthe vaccine trial, where we want the control arm to mimic the unvaccinated population, here we\r\ndo not.  We just want a known number of COVID-19 patients and healthy patients.  \r\n\r\nSo plug that into the Bayes equation above, to obtain:  \r\n\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{align*}\r\n\r\nPr(T+ | R+) &=  \\frac{\\frac{TP}{TP+FN} \\times \\frac{TP + FN}{N}}{\\frac{TP}{TP+FN} \\times \\frac{TP + FN}{N} + \\frac{FP}{FP+TN} \\times \\frac{FP+TN}{N}} \\\\\r\n            &= \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}\r\n\\end{align*}\r\n$$\r\n\r\n&hellip; which is what we got from direct inspection of the first row of the 2x2 table.  \r\n\r\nDoes that help?\r\n\r\n> And of course the false negative probability isn’t really literally 100.0%; that should be modified down depending on the error bars from the trial, whatever those were.\r\n\r\nYou are of course completely correct here.  In my defense, I will merely mention that the test took only 15 minutes and I couldn't get to the confidence limits that fast. :-)"
