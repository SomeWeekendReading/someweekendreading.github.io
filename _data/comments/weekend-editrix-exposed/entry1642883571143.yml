message: "Bienvenue &agrave; la Revolution, Citoyen Jean!  (Also, of course: welcome to the Weekend Commentariat.)  \r\n\r\n> Have you or the manufacturers given any thought to how much of the false negatives reported might be due to faulty sample collection?  \r\n\r\nI'm not privy to what goes on in diagnostic test development companies, though I've been involved in the research behind some of them.  People do indeed worry about consumer-grade tests, where the persons administering the test may not quite know what they're doing.  \"Pilot error\" is a real thing!  \r\n\r\nSo if you have a positive pregnancy test, when you go to the doctor you probably get another test.  I don't know if that's the case with COVID-19, but I'll bet if you show up with a positive antigen test your doc will prescribe a PCR test.  Then maybe a prescription for paxlovid, and best of luck finding a pharmacy to fill it.  \r\n\r\n> In general, people don't take time to understand statistics.  \r\n\r\nAmen to that.  I'm _certain_ some people at Acon understand the difference between TPR = 93% versus PPV = 89.4% and that the latter is more useful.  I'm equally certain their marketing people regard those persons as nerds who must be tolerated, but to whom they need not listen.  \r\n\r\nIt would help if they just said: if the test comes up positive it's almost certain you have COVID-19; if the test comes up negative it's only about an 11% chance you have COVID-19.  Retest negative again in 24hr and you can knock that down to about 1%.  \r\n\r\nI hope most people could understand that.  \r\n\r\nAs it says on the [quotes page for this blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#the-statistical-ones):  \r\n\r\n> "Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.\" &mdash; [H.G. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells)  \r\n\r\n"
