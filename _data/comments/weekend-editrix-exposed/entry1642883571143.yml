message: "Bienvenue &agrave; la Revolution, Citoyen Jean!  (Also, of course: welcome to the Weekend Commentariat.)  \r\n\r\n> Have you or the manufacturers given any thought to how much of the false negatives reported might be due to faulty sample collection?  \r\n\r\nI'm not privy to what goes on in diagnostic test development companies, though I've been involved in the research behind some of them (deriving _ab initio_ predictive response biomarkers for cancer drug candidates, mostly).  People do indeed worry about consumer-grade tests, where the persons administering the test may not quite know what they're doing.  \"Pilot error\" is a real thing!  \r\n\r\nSo if you have a positive pregnancy test, when you go to the doctor you probably get another pregnancy test, done in their hands.  I don't know if that's also the case with COVID-19, but I'll bet if you show up with a positive antigen test your doc will prescribe a PCR test.  (Then maybe a prescription for paxlovid, and heartfelt \"best wishes\" at finding a pharmacy to fill it.)  \r\n\r\n> In general, people don't take time to understand statistics.  \r\n\r\nAmen to that.  \r\n\r\nI'm _certain_ some people at Acon understand the difference between TPR = 93% versus PPV = 89.4%, and that the latter is more useful.  I'm equally certain their marketing department regards those people as nerds who must be grudgingly tolerated, but to whom they need not actually listen.  \r\n\r\nIt would help if they just said: hey, if the test comes up positive it's almost certain you have COVID-19; otherwise if the test comes up negative it's only about an 11% chance you have COVID-19.  Retest negative again in 24hr and you can knock that down to about 1%.  \r\n\r\nI hope most people could understand that.  \r\n\r\nAs it says on the [quotes page for this blog]({{ site.baseurl }}/quotes/#the-statistical-ones):  \r\n\r\n> \"Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.\" &mdash; [H.G. Wells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells)  \r\n\r\nAlas, that was a century ago.  \r\n\r\nLater: Also worth noting from 3 days ago is [an article at _Your Local Epidemiologist_](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/antigen-tests-real-world-data) with some quantitative studies of antigen tests in the wild, i.e., as self-administered by ordinary people in the context of Omicron.  Still looks pretty good, and that's a hopeful sign!  \r\n"
