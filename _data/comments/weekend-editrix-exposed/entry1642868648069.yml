message: "Have you or the manufacturers given any thought to how much of the false negatives reported might be due to faulty sample collection? Perhaps there are so many other possible reasons for false negatives that this is a minor concern? (such as low viral load may result in higher false negs)\r\n\r\nI know too many people who would be squeamish about sticking a swab up their nose or swabbing the back of the throat to do the test properly. If the study was closely supervised to ensure high quality sampling, then that minimizes the concern over the accuracy of the vendor's claims (btw Acon PROBABLY used 93% for marketing (as it is better than 89%). In general, people don't take time to understand statistics."
