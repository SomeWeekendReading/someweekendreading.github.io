message: "Would a second test with the same rapid test result in an improved NPV to the degree that simple mathematical extrapolation would imply?  \r\n0.106 squared equals 0.011, which gives an NPV of 98.9%.  \r\nBut, this might not work if there is some issue that causes repetitive errors in the particular test (eg, if a specific viral strain is difficult for this test to identify).  Such an issue would mean that the errors in the test are not simply random. It might be that for 5% of Covid viral strains the test always fails to recognize it, and for the remaining 95% of samples it randomly fails to recognize another 5.6%."
