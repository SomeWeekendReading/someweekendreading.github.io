message: "Thanks! It's been a pleasure to read your very informative posts on the state of the evidence and the regulatory agencies.\r\n\r\nOn the question at hand: I see how that gives the correct posterior probability of infection *for someone who was a participant in the trial*, but that's the circumstance in which the test is being used here.\r\n\r\nIs the conclusion you're drawing that anyone who takes the FlowFlex test and gets a negative result should emerge with an 89.4% probability that they're not infected?  Surely that's generalizing way too far... For example, if an astronaut near the end of a three-month International Space Station mission takes the test, their conclusion should be 99.9-some-% that they aren't infected.  Surely the same goes even if the test is negative!\r\n\r\nThe example is meant to illustrate that the posterior probability should be highly dependent on things like the number and closeness of contacts for the individual taking the test."
