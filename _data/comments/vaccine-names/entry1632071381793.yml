message: "Ever since I started to work in pharma, I was wondering who comes up with the names and what goes on in their minds (and are they really able to pronounce words like Epcoritamab or Daratumumab?) \r\n\r\nAlso, I have the cool name :) -checked my electronic vaccination certificate and  says SpikeVax (previously covid19 moderna). Looks like the government hijacked my phone to update the vaccine name :Â¦."
