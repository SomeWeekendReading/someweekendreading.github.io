message: "Cities in British Columbia faced another hour of conveyance convoys and rallies in harmony with protesters occupying downtown Ottawa in antagonistic to COVID-19 mandates on Saturday. \r\n \r\nVancouver administer said Saturday afternoon that hundreds of vehicles from a Lower Mainland convoy had entered the downtown core causing valued congestion. \r\nhttps://newsca.ca/ \r\nDowngrade Mainland demonstrators gathered in Langley more willingly than driving to downtown Vancouver in spite of a rally at Robson and Burrard streets. The Vancouver Islet convoy left Campbell River at daybreak Saturday, with plans to put on a recovery at the Victoria legislature. \r\n \r\nTheres not a mortal physically here interested in any issues other than our freedom. Nothing wants to claim, no one wants to feud with, nothing wants to defile anything, Langley convoy sharer Escarpment Caron told News Canada in preference to hitting the road."
