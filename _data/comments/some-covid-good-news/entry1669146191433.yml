message: "Yes, that is _absolutely_ good news!\r\n\r\nIn fact, it's better than it appears on the surface: it's taken just once a day (so maybe better patient compliance) and it doesn't seem to need the ritonavir booster to block the liver enzyme that degrades it (so probably fewer drug-drug interactions).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's the exact same mechanism of action as paxlovid (3CLpro inhibitor).  So it works as well as paxlovid, but any paxlovid resistance mutations will hit this new drug as well.\r\n\r\nAnd... some people who sound relatively crazy to me have been discussing how to _breed_ SARS-CoV2 variants with exactly that resistance.  I wish they wouldn't do that!"
