message: "Hi, Kto:  \r\n\r\nWelcome, and thanks for taking the time to read a post!  \r\n\r\nIt's nice to hear from somebody who is neither a Russian casino spammer nor a personal\r\nacquaintance/family. :-)  This crummy little blog has a global readership of about 6, but\r\n3 of them are my spouse, my cat, and myself.  And the cat isn't a particularly close\r\nreader.  \r\n\r\nLet me rephrase your question, so we can at least share a qualitative understanding of\r\nwhat we're _trying_ to wrap our heads around:  \r\n- In the US, breakthrough infections are rare, and almost never lead to hospitalization or\r\n  death.  (See: first 2 references [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/thoughts-on-variants/),\r\n  documenting the claim that 99.5% of US COVID-19 deaths are now among the unvaccinated.)\r\n- But in the UK and Israel, most deaths are from the fully vaccinated.  \r\n\r\nI'll start by saying I haven't read data saying that about the UK and Israel.  This is\r\nnot at all unexpected, since I haven't sought it out.  In fact, my (only very lightly\r\ninformed) impression was the opposite: see [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/good-news-on-covid-variants/)\r\nfor evidence from a Qatari study and an Israeli study documenting near-100% efficacy vs severe\r\ndisease after both doses of mRNA vaccines.  \r\n\r\nBut for the sake of discussion I'll take you at your word that you think this is the case,\r\nand you may even be right since I'm not especially informed here.  The question then is: why do we\r\nthink vaccination is so protective against death in the US, but in the UK and Israel it\r\nlooks less so?  \r\n\r\nIf I had access to actual data showing that, then maybe we could do some statistical\r\nhypothesis testing.  But I don't have that data, and given the chaotic patchwork of EMR\r\nsystems in the US, it's pretty much unobtainable.  There's a reason some of the best\r\nstudies I've seen were the Israeli &amp; Qatari ones: they have actual universal health care\r\nand universal EMR systems so the can get at reasonable datasets.  \r\n\r\nBut with things as they are, I'll just content myself with pointing out some of the\r\nproblems of comparing across countries and medical systems:  \r\n<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-07-29-anger-among-vaccinated-covariants.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\" alt=\"NYT: Variants in the US (Delta in green)\" title=\"NYT: Variants in the US (Delta in green)\" style=\"float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\r\n  - __Differential viral variant mixes:__  The Delta variant didn't appear simultaneously in all\r\n  countries.  (That would have been _terrifying._)  It came first out of India, then began\r\n  appearing in the UK &amp; Israel, and didn't emerge in the US until April 2021.  The plot\r\n  here shows the preponderance of the variants vs time in the US; Delta is the scary green\r\n  thing that grew rapidly after April.  That means for a study at a fixed point in time,\r\n  the US is looking at different viral variants than the UK &amp; Israel.  \r\n- __Differential population behaviors:__ These 3 countries have populations who behave\r\n  vastly differently among each other.  \r\n  - Israel was admirably fast with vaccination, doing\r\n    the elderly first.  The UK was pretty OK.  In the US, we whined, and moaned, and\r\n    complained, and stomped our feet, and made up conspiracy theories to try to squirm\r\n    around vaccination.  Basically I'm saying you probably have much greater compliance\r\n    with public health in the UK &amp; Israel (though I'm so sick &amp; tired of the US\r\n    vaccine resistance that it might be\r\n    [confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) on my part to say\r\n    that.) \r\n    - So in the US we're more likely to have willfully unvaccinated middle-aged to\r\n      elderly people, who are at most danger of death from COVID-19.  Any serious\r\n      statistical modeling would have to take into account public health compliance.  \r\n    - Even inside the US, you have different subpopulations with radically different\r\n      responses to public health guidance.  New England masked up, socially distanced, and\r\n      got vaccinated pretty fast.  In the South, they're still debating about whether the\r\n      vaccine is from Satan, or just from Bill Gates &amp; George Soros.  Very different,\r\n      and hard to compare!  \r\n  \r\n<img src=\"{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2021-05-21-wastewater-redux-plot-med-loads-vs-RNA-1.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"SARS-CoV2 viral mRNA in Boston wastewater vs hospital useage vars\" title=\"SARS-CoV2 viral mRNA in Boston wastewater vs hospital useage vars\" style=\"float: right; margin: 3px 3px 3px 3px; border: 1px solid #000000;\">\r\n    - Also, it depends on _when_ the waves hit each country, since best-practice medical\r\n    care changed.  Basically we learned how to care for COVID-19 patients as time went on:\r\n    use of remdesivir & dexamethasone, intubating in prone position, supplemental\r\n    antibodies, and so on.  See, for example [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/wastewater-redux/)\r\n    where I looked at viral mRNA recovered from sewage processing in Boston over about a\r\n    year, and 2 different waves of infection.  I built regression models predicting\r\n    hospitalization, ICU admission, and ventilator useage from the sewage viral mRNA\r\n    levels.  It sort of worked and sort of didn't, since the 2nd wave had much _less_\r\n    hospitalization useage per sewage mRNA, because we _learned better how to treat patients_.\r\n    All the more so, the deat rates between the 3 countries will depend on exactly when\r\n    the waves occurred.  Serious statistical models have to take into account that medical\r\n    best practices changed with time, as well.  \r\n- __Differential immunity waning:__ We don't know how long immunity lasts.  All the data\r\n  I've looked at (and blogged about) says it lasts pretty well so far, especially against\r\n  hospitalization &amp; death.  But let's suppose it fades.  It will then fade first in\r\n  the group first vaccinated.  Israel was very good about vaccinating its elderly very\r\n  fast.  The US&hellip; somewhat less so.  Then more immunity waning would have happened\r\n  in Israel, leading to more deaths among the vaccinated.  (I'm pretty sure I don't\r\n  believe the immunity fades that fast, but I could be wrong.  See the Israeli &amp;\r\n  Qatari data [referred to above]({{ site.baseurl }}/good-news-on-covid-variants/) for a\r\n  real-world example.)  \r\n- __Differential $R_0$:__ The viral $R_0$ depends on the virus/host biology (binding to\r\n  the ACE2 receptor, endocytosis mechanism, reproduction speed, etc.).  But it _also_\r\n  depends on host behavior: masking, social distancing, no indoor gatherings, etc.  We can\r\n  alter the effective $R_0$.  The evidence is clear that some populations do a better job\r\n  of this than others; see the American South for an example of how not to do it.  \r\n- __Rising vaccinated population:__ Every time we calculate a case rate for the\r\n  vaccinated, we need a ratio of 2 numbers: the number of diagnosed cases in the\r\n  vaccinated population, divided by the size of the vaccinated population.  The problem\r\n  with comparisons over time is that _the denominator has been growing_ (and that's a good\r\n  thing!) as more people get vaccinated.  So the virus, over time, has become both more\r\n  infective (Delta variant) and it has more shots on goal, i.e., more vaccinated people to\r\n  attack.  \r\n  \r\n__Summary:__ I don't quite believe that the death rates in other countries are now mostly\r\namong the vaccinated, and have some data that makes me think that.  However, whatever the\r\ndifference in vaccinated death rates are between countries, comparisons over different\r\npopulations exposed to different variants with different medical care best practices and\r\ndifferent compliance with public health guidance is&hellip; unlikely to be\r\nstraightforward?"
