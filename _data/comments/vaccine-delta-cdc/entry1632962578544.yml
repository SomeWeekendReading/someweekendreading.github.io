message: "Hey,\r\n\r\nI'm aware of Simpson’s paradox, but I don't think it resolves our original issue. Morris' data shows that when you stratify the data by age, you find ~80-90% efficacy against severe cases among the most vulnerable groups. Given ~90% vaccination rate, this is consistent with the vaccinated people making ~50% of all deaths. So, there is still a missing factor of ~125, when you compare the UK and  Israeli data to the Fauci’s 0.8% claim for the US."
