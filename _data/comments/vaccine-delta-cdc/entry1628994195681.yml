message: "Thank you for the detailed response.\r\n\r\n“Summary: I don’t quite believe that the death rates in other countries are now mostly among the vaccinated”\r\n\r\nYou don’t have to take my word on it. Here is a direct link to the official UK government data:\r\n\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1009243/Technical_Briefing_20.pdf\r\n\r\nAccording to the UK report, 54% of all deaths from delta are in fully vaccinated patients.  By contrast, according to Fauci’s claim only 0.8% of recent deaths in the US came from the fully vaccinated people (i.e., the odds ratio of 125:1 instead of approximately 1:1). There is a missing factor of ~125 here."
