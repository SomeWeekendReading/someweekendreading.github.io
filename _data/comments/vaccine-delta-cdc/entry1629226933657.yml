message: "Yeah, you convinced me there's something contradictory here.\r\n\r\nAll the other stories report very low death rates among the vaccinees, e.g. [here](https://twitter.com/carolynryan/status/1426005419424731142/).\r\n\r\nPerhaps there's some time skew, where the low death rates are pre-Delta?  Or is somebody using a different denominator without actually describing what they're doing?  (My experience: more confusion comes from trying to \"avoid math\" and not write an equation.  A bowl of word salad vaguely explaining it is an invitation to trouble.)"
