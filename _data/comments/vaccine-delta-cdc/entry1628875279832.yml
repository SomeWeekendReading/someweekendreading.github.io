message: "Hi Weekend Editor,\r\n\r\nI found your blog through the ACX classified thread. I have a question about your post:\r\n\r\nHow can your statement (\"Vaccinated people can (rarely!) get asymptomatic Delta\") and the claim that \"Against severe disease requiring hospitalization, it was 97% efficacy\" be reconciled with the data from UK and Israel where the majority of deaths come from fully vaccinated?\r\n\r\nGiven that the fraction of vaccinated among the elderly there is around 90% (less among the younger age groups), with the 97% efficacy the deaths among the vaccinated should be under 25%."
