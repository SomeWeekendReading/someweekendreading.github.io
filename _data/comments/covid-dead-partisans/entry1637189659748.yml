message: "Absolutely.  Sure does look like that, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nI was actually thinking of a [Box-Cox transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_transform#Box%E2%80%93Cox_transformation), one special case of which is a log transform.  Then optimize for the $\\chi^2$ of a linear fit to choose the optimal parameter in the B-C transform.\r\n\r\nAlso, sometimes it's useful to do a rank parametric statistic on the untransformed data, to be sure any result is not an artifact of transformation.  So that's why I wanted a Spearman correlation.\r\n\r\nBut it seems Gaba hasn't released the raw data.  Given how hard it is to collect, he may not want to.  I guess I could ask him."
