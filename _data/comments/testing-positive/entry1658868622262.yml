message: "First, welcome to the Weekend Commentariat!\r\n\r\nSecond, I like you: you're asking the questions I probably _should have_ asked, but I just went with my gut instead.  Someday, I'm gonna learn to do better.  \r\n\r\nStill, the data is there: on 2022-Jun-02, I blogged about a very nice Israeli study on [paxlovid in the wild](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/paxlovid-in-the-wild/), i.e., what response they observed on actual patient populations instead of in clinical trials.  This is as real as it gets.  \r\n\r\nSome facts, for people aged 65+ like me:  \r\n- 67% reduction in hospitalization  \r\n- 81% reduction in death  \r\n\r\nIndeed, I suspect a vague recollection of those 2 facts and some knowledge of the safety profile of paxlovid (very safe) led me to jump at the chance to get it.  But honestly, I was feeling pretty sick and a little scared, so I did what seemed like the safe thing.  \r\n\r\nNow specifically to your probability questions: I pulled the numbers out of the Israeli paper (see the table in the blog post above's section called \"The topline result\"). For people age 65+, it looks like the numbers are (with error bars I haven't bothered to figure out, but could):  \r\n- $\\Pr(\\mbox{hosp}\\|\\mbox{paxlovid}) = 0.6\\%$  \r\n- $\\Pr(\\mbox{hosp}\\|\\mbox{no paxlovid}) = 1.9\\%$  \r\n- $\\Pr(\\mbox{death}\\|\\mbox{paxlovid}) = 0.1\\%$  \r\n- $\\Pr(\\mbox{death}\\|\\mbox{no paxlovid}) = 0.4\\%$  \r\n\r\nThose imply a reduction in hospitalization of $100\\% \\times (1.9 - 0.6) / 1.9 = 68\\%$, and a reduction in death of $100\\% \\times (0.4 - 0.1) / 0.4 = 75\\%$.  That doesn't _quite_ match their quoted reductions of 67% and 81% above, but it's close.  \r\n\r\nThe difference we can ascribe to the fact that, having access to the whole dataset, they could do a Cox proportional hazards analysis that takes into account dropouts from the trial.  That's the thing to do when you have _real_ data, not just a crude overall average like I've done here.  \r\n\r\nSo, there you go.  I believe I've reduced my risk of hospitalization and death by a considerable factor.  You might, perhaps, take the alternative view that those risks were low already and not worth bothering about.  When it's my own personal body at risk, I chose to take relatively easy, safe, and straightforward steps to reduce that already small risk.  I have umbrella insurance for the same reason.\r\n\r\nI hope that answers your question?"
