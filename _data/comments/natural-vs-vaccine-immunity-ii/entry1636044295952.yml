Do you have thoughts about the Israeli observational study that found much better and longer-lasting protection from natural immunity? https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262415v1.full\r\n\r\nIt's good that this is being studied, since one of the toughest questions facing us now (in my opinion) is whether there is any significant benefit from mandating vaccinations for previously infected people."
