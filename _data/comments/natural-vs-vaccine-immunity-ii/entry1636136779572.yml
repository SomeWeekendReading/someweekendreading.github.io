message: "In a wonderful example of synchronicity, today the universe brought to my attention\r\n[this paper in _Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00955-3).  \r\n\r\nAs an example of variables we didn't previously understand and control for, consider the\r\nleucine zipper gene [LZTFL1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/54585).  It has a common\r\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) [rs17713054G>A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs1738074).\r\nPeople with this variant seem to have a harder time with COVID-19, as identified in genome-wide\r\nassociation studies that pointed at 3p21.31, where LZTFL1 lives.  It seems to work by\r\nepithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cells rather than immune cells.  \r\n\r\nIt's heritable, so it runs in various ethnic groups.  Today's fact is that it's common in South\r\nAsians, i.e., Indians, Pakistanis, and so on.  \r\n\r\nIt's by no means a stretch of the imagination that there might be a difference between Israelis\r\nand Americans that could explain the difference in natural immunity.  (No proof, of course.)"
