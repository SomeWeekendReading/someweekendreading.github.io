message: "> Interesting, this is surprising to me. Do you have thoughts about the Israeli observational\r\n> study that found much better and longer-lasting protection from natural immunity?  \r\n\r\nThoughts? Sure!  Useful thoughts?  Not so much&hellip;  \r\n\r\nBasically, this is a sign that we're on the cutting edge of new knowledge here, because the\r\nexperimental data is all over the map.  In a few months to a few years, we'll get it all\r\nsorted.  It will turn out that studies reaching different conclusions were because of\r\nsome variable we hadn't previously appreciated, which was set differently in each study.  Until\r\nthen&hellip; well, things are weird and we have to cope with ambiguity.  \r\n\r\nOne thing I like about this CDC study is that it's pretty RWE (\"real-world evidence\", and yes,\r\nthey really do have\r\n[Congressionally-mandated definitions](https://www.fda.gov/science-research/science-and-research-special-topics/real-world-evidence)\r\nfor that!): find a bunch of people using the EMR systems, track them for a while, report what\r\nhappened.  It's about what happens when humans are out in the wild, living their lives.  \r\n\r\nThere are some design flaws, of course: not yet peer reviewed (at least not outside CDC),\r\npeople who were vaccinated were probably told they're safe which changed their risk-taking\r\nbehavior, and so on.  \r\n\r\nIf you follow the link to the Israeli study you mentioned, you'll see that people are debating\r\nin the comments the differences between that one and the CDC one.  (Though&hellip; yeah, I\r\nprobably shouldn't be reading the comments, and I backed out quickly.)  \r\n\r\nFinally, since everybody's passing out Israeli studies (see what clever people can accomplish\r\nwith true national healthcare and a unified EMR system?), check out\r\n[this one from a few months ago](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/vax-better/).  They showed\r\ndrastically higher antibody levels from vaccination, even in the elderly, even after\r\ndeconvolving with age to avoid Simpson's paradox.  I mean, yeah, it's only antibodies; who\r\nknows what those folks' memory B-cells are thinking?  \r\n\r\nSo this is clearly an instance of Scott Alexander's Razor:  \r\n\r\n> [data] seems to have reached a level of complexity where I no longer feel comfortable having\r\n> an opinion about it.  \r\n\r\nI just note that the best experts in the world are confused about apparently contradictory\r\ndata, and suspect I have no leverage to tell them why any better than they can themselves.  \r\n\r\n> It's good that this is being studied, since one of the toughest questions facing us now (in my\r\n> opinion) is whether there is any significant benefit from mandating vaccinations for previously\r\n> infected people.  \r\n\r\nI'm less worried about that, since it seems extremely clear that the downside to getting vaxxed\r\nis pretty minimal.  Use of\r\n[_Jacobson v Massachusetts_](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/vaccine-mandate-history/)\r\nto back mandates with legal force will make people _furious_.  But they will get vaccinated,\r\nand thus live and not die.\r\n\r\nI do have some background worries about people who have good medical reason they _can't_ be\r\nvaccinated.   I have a friend who's had Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, and has to consult his\r\nPCP and some immunologists before getting any vaccine.  I don't want him forced into something\r\nthat will hurt him.\r\n\r\nBut for most people it's now _likely_ that there's an upside given the CDC evidence, and it's\r\n_unlikely_ there's much of a downside."
