message: "> I enjoy your blog.  \r\n\r\nLouise, it's so nice to hear from you!  I had no idea you were reading your way through this madness.  \r\n\r\n> I especially enjoy the stats :-)  \r\n\r\nComing from someone with your qualifications, I really appreciate that.  I have occasional nightmares that somebody who really knows their stuff will come by and tell me I'm doing posterior Beta distributions wrong. :-)  \r\n\r\n> It’s also interesting to see some of what’s going on in the US from the inside.  \r\n\r\nThe US seen from the inside is a slightly ugly sight, I'm afraid.  At least nowadays, from a lefty perspective.  OTOH, my only insight into the UK from an internal perspective is Charlie Stross's [blog](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/) and his [_Laundry Files_ novels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Laundry_Files)... at least _some_ of which I _hope_ is fiction.   \r\n\r\n> Plus, it’s nice to have a connection, however tenuous, with an old friend.\r\n\r\nGood to hear from you too.  I thought of you recently when I heard jokes about people attempting to use Excel to manage data science workflows, about which I'm sure you'd have a few very tart remarks!"
