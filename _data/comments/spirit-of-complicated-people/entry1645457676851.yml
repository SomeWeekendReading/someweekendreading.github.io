message: "How interesting!  I had not thought that the plaques might be from a different era.  Thank you for pointing out this possibility.\r\n\r\nHowever, the photo above from 1860 shows the plaques in place and appearing somewhat oxidized even then, so they're at least from the 19th century.  On the other hand, the array of stars on the base in the 19th century was removed by the 20th.  So your point that people have been monkeying about with this statue is an excellent one.\r\n\r\nThe custom of rubbing them, of course, seems to be from the 1990s based on the photographs above.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there's some curator in Prague to whom we can write to get the definitive bits?"
