  The statue on the top may date from 1683, but those bronze bas-relief plaques
  around the base with the lady, and the knight, and the dog and so on, are very
  much from the modern period.  They look distinctly early 20th century.  They
  are rendered in a faux-retro style that was popular in the 1920s-1940s, maybe
  even a little later.
