message: "Thanks for this info! If I'm reading the plot correctly, Moderna also gives me the strongest response if my original shots were Moderna? \r\n\r\nI wasn't in a hurry to get boosted because I was slammed by my second dose of Moderna at the end of April, unable to get out of bed for about 24 hours. But, my 80-yo mother was just hospitalized with Covid across the country, Omicron is coming, etc., so I now have a Moderna booster scheduled Monday morning. \r\n\r\nI read something yesterday about the J&J booster having the highest response via T cells, though lower via antibodies. Have you heard anything about that? Would that be valuable, especially in light of Omicron?"
