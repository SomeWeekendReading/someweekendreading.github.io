message: "Dear Weekend Editor,\r\n\r\nI appreciate the work that has gone into this post and the convenience of having these papers aggregated into one place. I am amazed you've been this productive while suffering from so many symptoms. I hope you feel well soon!\r\n\r\nFirst, I hope to point out an issue in the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n> Now, what about the patients who have _both_ a high level of virus rebound (≥ 5.0 log 10 mRNA copies/mL) _and_ a change in symptoms? That’s what we want to know about: a viral load high enough to be a spreader, and symptoms strong enough to make the patient miserable. We are, or should be, in the business of stopping disease spread and relieving misery!\r\n\r\nIf we are in the business of stopping disease spread and relieving misery, we should be interested in the patients spreading disease and, separately, we should be interested in patients with symptoms. If only patients with symptomatic rebound and viral rebound count, we will neither stop the spread of disease nor scourge of symptoms. We should take the union, not the intersection!\r\n\r\nSecond, while Ranganath _et al_ may have been behind a paywall at the time of writing, it isn't any longer. The full text can be found [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9384250/pdf/ciac481.pdf).\r\n\r\nDiving in allows us to see that 'rebound' in Ranganath _et al_ is roughly equivalent to 'symptomatic rebound' in Deo _et al_. This means that comparing the proportion of patients with symptomatic and viral rebound in Deo _et al_ with the proportion of patients in Ranganath _et al_ who have symptomatic rebound - as was done in this short meta-analysis - is highly misleading.\r\n\r\nIn your correspondent's humble option, an ideal analysis would compare the proportion of patients with either symptomatic or viral rebound with and without Paxlovid. Sadly, since Ranganath _et al_ do not test for viral rebound, we lack the data this analysis requires.\r\n\r\nWe can, however, compare the proportion of patients who get symptomatic rebound with and without Paxlovid. The data is sufficient for this. Reproducing your analysis with this as our reference class gives the following results:\r\n\r\nI'll begin with the point estimates. Deo _et al_ finds that 66 out of 247 patients (27%) not treated with Paxlovid suffer from symptom rebound. Ranganath _et al_ find that only 4 out of 483 patients (0.83%) treated with Paxlovid suffer from symptom rebound.\r\n\r\nIs that difference statistically significant? You might guess “yes”, given that the sample size is large and the point estimates are so different. You would be correct.\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\n> xtab <- as.table(rbind(c(66, 181), c(4, 479)))\r\n> dimnames(xtab) <- list(\r\ngroup = c(\"Deo et al\", \"Ranganath et al\"),\r\n  rebound = c(\"yes\", \"no\")\r\n)\r\n> # compare the proportion of that rebound\r\n> prop.test(xtab)\r\n\t2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction\r\n\r\ndata:  xtab\r\nX-squared = 123.41, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16\r\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\r\n95 percent confidence interval:\r\n 0.2000926 0.3177572\r\nsample estimates:\r\n     prop 1      prop 2 \r\n0.267206478 0.008281573 \r\n```\r\n\r\nA simple test of equality of proportions give $p < 2.2 \\times 10^{-16}$. So, yes, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that patients *not* treated with Paxlovid are more likely to experience a rebound of symptoms than a patient treated with Paxlovid.\r\n\r\nWeekend Editor, I am writing to you to suggest that symptomatic rebound is MUCH more common without Paxlovid. Like, by a lot. Not only does the mainstream narrative appear to have the wrong sign, since this is a [ginormous effect\_size](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2022/07/21/on-the-hunt-for-ginormous-effect-sizes/), the mainstream narrative is wrong by a lot!\r\n\r\nYours faithfully,\r\nJonathan Nankivell"
