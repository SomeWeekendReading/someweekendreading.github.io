message: "First, welcome to the Weekend Commentariat!  It's always nice to have another reader, especially since I have all of about 6 readers worldwide anyway.  Also, you seem to be a very deep &amp; _careful_ reader, so that's good.  And I see we're both R enthusiasts, who like to check models for ourselves.  So that's 3 ways in which it is as though we are brothers.\r\n\r\nNow let's go on to the more substantive issues you raise:  \r\n\r\n__First issue:__ \"stopping disease spread and relieving misery\" Yes, of course we should be interested in both.  But&hellip; realistically we _cannot know_ if there are asymptomatic rebounds, since we cannot force people to test and report the results.  So people symptomatic enough to require care are our only point of intervention.  (There are other ways: China, for example, physically confines people until they've tested negative several times.  That's&hellip; dystopian at the very least.)\r\n\r\nSo I was thinking &ndash; vaguely, which I hope you will excuse due to COVID brain fog &ndash; that the symptomatic patients were _likely_ to be high viral load and were the only handle we could get on the problem.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not a public healthy guy; these problems are complex and we have professionals who work on them, if only we will listen to them.\r\n\r\n__Second issue:__ I'm very glad to hear Ranganath, _et al._ is no longer paywalled!  (I hate paywalls, as you may have gathered.)  From the public-facing abstract, I was unable to see their diagnostic criteria.  I'm glad you had the wit and energy to dig in and see that their criteria were like \"symptomatic rebound\" in the other paper.\r\n\r\nSo, I agree with you that the comparison I made, based on only seeing the abstract, is misleading because it compares incomparables: patient groups chosen by different criteria.  Your comparison of symptomatic rebounds with and without paxlovid is the best we can do here.\r\n\r\nI'm _delighted_ to hear that the comparison _vastly_ favors paxlovid!  (BTW, 2.2e-16 is the lowest _p_-value R will report; if you dig into the test object there is a field with the actual value, usually much lower.  But, very sensibly, nobody wants to report a p-value of 1.0e-43 or such nonsense.)\r\n\r\nSee, the reason I wrote the post (beyond retirement hobby interest in blogging) was that people were bugging me about \"paxlovid rebound\" as a reason _not_ to take paxlovid.  (See the Jerome Adams tweet above, where docs in Florida were refusing to prescribe paxlovid, because rebounds mean \"it doesn't work\"!)\r\n\r\nSo I was happy enough to see that there was no statistically significant difference in rebound probabilities, with or without paxlovid.  But by properly reading the paper taken out from behind the paywall, you've shown a much more dramatic result: rebound is _33 times less likely_ with paxlovid, a spectacular point in favor of paxlovid!\r\n\r\nThanks for that, and again welcome."
