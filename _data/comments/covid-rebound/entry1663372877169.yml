message: "First, welcome to the Weekend Commentariat!  It's always nice to have another reader,\r\nespecially since I have all of about 6 readers worldwide anyway.  Also, you seem to be a\r\nvery deep &amp; _careful_ reader, so that's good.  And I see we're both R enthusiasts, who\r\nlike to check models for ourselves.  So that's 3 ways in which it is as though we are\r\nbrothers.\r\n\r\nNow let's go on to the more substantive issues you raise:  \r\n\r\n__First issue:__ \"stopping disease spread and relieving misery\" Yes, of course we should be\r\ninterested in both.  But&hellip; realistically we _cannot know_ if there are asymptomatic\r\nrebounds, since we cannot force people to test and report the results.  So people\r\nsymptomatic enough to report care are our only point of intervention.  (There are other\r\nways: China, for example, physically confines people until they've tested negative several\r\ntimes.  That's&hellip; dystopian at the very least.)\r\n\r\nSo I was thinking &ndash; vaguely, which I hope you will excuse due to COVID brain fog\r\n&ndash; that the symptomatic patients were _likely_ to be high viral load and were the\r\nonly handle we could get on the problem.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not a public healthy guy; these problems are complex and we have professionals who\r\nwork on them, if only we will listen to them.\r\n\r\n__Second issue:__ I'm very glad to hear Ranganath, _et al._ is no longer paywalled!  (I\r\nhate paywalls, as you may have gathered.)  From the public-facing abstract, I was unable\r\nto see their diagnostic criteria.  I'm glad you had the wit and energy to dig in and see\r\nthat their criteria were like \"symptomatic rebound\" in the other paper.\r\n\r\nSo, I agree with you that the comparison I made, based on only seeing the abstract, is\r\nmisleading because it compares incomparables: patient groups chosen by different criteria.\r\nYour comparison of symptomatic rebounds with and without paxlovid is the best we can do\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nI'm _delighted_ to hear that the comparison _vastly_ favors paxlovid!  (BTW, 2.2e-16 is\r\nthe lowest _p_-value R will report; if you dig into the test object there is a field with\r\nthe actual value, usually much lower.  But, very sensibly, nobody wants to report a\r\np-value of 1.0e-43 or such nonsense.)\r\n\r\nSee, the reason I wrote the post (beyond retirement hobby interest in blogging) was that\r\npeople were bugging me about \"paxlovid rebound\" as a reason _not_ to take paxlovid.  (See\r\nthe Jerome Adams tweet above, where docs in Florida were refusing to prescribe paxlovid,\r\nbecause rebounds mean \"it doesn't work\"!)\r\n\r\nSo I was happy enough to see that there was no statistically significant difference in\r\nrebound probabilities, with or without paxlovid.  But by properly reading the paper taken out\r\nfrom behind the paywall, you've shown a much more dramatic result: rebound is\r\n_33 times less likely_ with paxlovid, a spectacular point in favor of paxlovid!\r\n\r\nThanks for that, and again welcome."
