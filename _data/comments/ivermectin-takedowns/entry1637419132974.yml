  So it seems that the NIH took ivermectin more seriously and included it in the
  ATCIV 6 trial (https://activ6study.org/) with a proper design . First readout
  (not sure if they also have a futility analysis first, as ACTIV3 does) should
  come before Christmas. Hopefully this will settle the story once and for all.
