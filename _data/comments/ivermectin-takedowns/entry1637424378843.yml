message: "Well&hellip; I _guess_ I'm glad they're doing a definitive study.  \r\n\r\nBut really, to me the case is now pretty much closed: most of it fraught with fraud &amp; incompetence, the remainder either explained by worm infestations or null result.  I wonder how they treat the ethics of witholding SoC in favor of ivermectin?\r\n\r\nI just looked through the ACTIV6 web site (thanks for the pointer!), and they say there are no approved drugs for mild to moderate COVID-19.  I but there's a meeting in about 10 days re molnupiravir approval, and paxlovid will almost certainly follow in December.  And molnupiravir is _already_ approved in the UK.  So maybe time to update the ACTIV6 web site."
