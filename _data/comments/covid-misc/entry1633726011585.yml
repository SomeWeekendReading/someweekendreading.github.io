  Would you "propose demonic possession as a potential diagnosis" of black
  Americans--the least vaccinated sub-population?  Of course not.  This is
  because you suffer from communist possession of your craven mental faculties.
  The reason for your hypocrisy lies in your cowardice.  The Left is a malignant
  cancer; you are infected and don't know it.  And what do we do to malignant
  cancers, oh failed cancer scientist?
