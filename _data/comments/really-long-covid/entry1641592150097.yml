message: "Hi, Louise &mdash; always good to hear from you.  \r\n\r\n> That 1.8% lethality rate is really important&hellip;  \r\n\r\nAbsolutely!  It could have been much, much worse.  Especially in 2020 when no vaccines were available: if we'd had a virus with the fierce propagation of Omicron and the lethality of MERS, we might have lost 1/3rd of humanity.  That's in the same territory as the Black Plague in Europe.  \r\n\r\n> Extrapolation from 2 years of experience to the next 20,000 years is not for the faint hearted.  \r\n\r\nBut also keep in mind that 20,000 year epidemic was in a Stone Age society with no science, no medicine, no public health.  They had only 2 things to protect them: (a) their genes, and (b) their behaviors (superstitious avoidance of ritually unclean things, and a disgust instinct to avoid stuff that looks or smells bad).  That's not _nothing,_ but it's also not much.  \r\n\r\nAnd it's not our situation.  \r\n\r\nWe now have well-founded NPI's like proper masks and social distancing.  We have vaccines that work _amazingly_ well.  We also have really fascinating [research in progress on pancoronavirus vaccines](https://www.someweekendreading.blog/covid-misc/#research-on-a-pan-coronavirus-vaccine) that might work across the whole family. [A ferritin nanoparticle](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.abi5735) looks promising, [described by Your Local Epidemiologist](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/pan-coronavirus-super-vaccine) as like a soccer ball presenting multiple ligands on each face (apparently referring to [this Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00340-4)).  \r\n\r\nSo I highlighted the 20,000 year thing as a riposte to the knuckleheads who say we \"just have to let it burn through\" and get herd immunity the hard way, apparently largely because scientists are a bunch of lefty elitists with no social skills and poor fashion choices.  Or something.  \r\n\r\nAll we have to do is make the smart choices here.  Which is, surprisingly to me, proving difficult in an environment full of nascent fascists who deny reality itself.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm gloomy today."
