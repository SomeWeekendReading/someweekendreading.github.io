message: "That 1.8% lethality rate is really important, and one of the things that has driven my contention that Covid-19 is really just a near miss for the sort of pandemic that really would be bad. But the idea that it'll be at this level for another 20,000 years is also something to think about. Is what we thought we had -- a pandemic lasting for a year or so -- actually the near miss, and what we actually have -- a pandemic lasting for 20,000 years or so -- the real thing?\r\n\r\nWe don't know. Extrapolation from 2 years of experience to the next 20,000 years is not for the faint hearted."
