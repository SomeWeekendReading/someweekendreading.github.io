message: "I fixed the hyperlinks for you.  (Sorry about that: comments here use [Github-Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/), rather than pure HTML.  Though you can get away with _some_ HTML, I've never bothered to figure out exactly which HTML elements work and which don't.)  \r\n\r\n> Itâ€™s exciting and humbling to see collaborations that are so broad and deep (Mass spec, paleogenomics, virology, epidemiology, evolution) that no one person could synthesize and understand it all. Except John von Neumann, maybe.  \r\n\r\nYeah, no kidding.  \r\n\r\nA truly amazing set of only vaguely related technologies (mRNA synthesizers, lipid nanocapsules, huge computing and sequencing resources, drugs like paxlovid&hellip;) all came to fruition _at the exact right moment._  The religious part of me wants to search for divine influence, while the skeptical part of me just notes that _of course_ we use all the tools that come to hand.  One lesson is that new knowledge is never wasted: sooner or later, we'll need it, so we better be able to look it up when the need is upon us.  \r\n\r\nRe von Neumann: Because of my history I was also bombarded with stories of his contemporaries, most relevantly in this case Norbert Wiener and Enrico Fermi.  Wiener would have invented a solution, but would probably forget to tell you about it unless you asked him every week.  Grad students eventually became wary of telling Fermi what they were working on, for fear he'd work it all out, solve the problem, and then they'd need a new thesis topic.  Von Neumann would have done the same thing, but he'd have invited you to a cocktail party in Princeton afterwards. :-)  \r\n\r\nAnd thanks for the suggested readings; they're in my queue."
