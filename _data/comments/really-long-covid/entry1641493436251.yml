message: "Thanks for the highlight and walk-through.  It's exciting and humbling to see collaborations that are so broad and deep (Mass spec, paleogenomics, virology, epidemiology, evolution) that no one person could synthesize and understand it all.  Except John von Neumann, maybe.\r\n\r\nNot entirely unrelated, in November the essayist Phillippe Lemoine published his speculation and model of the pandemic, [Have we been thinking about the pandemic wrong? The effect of population structure on transmission](https://cspicenter.org/blog/waronscience/have-we-been-thinking-about-the-pandemic-wrong-the-effect-of-population-structure-on-transmission/).  The title is adequate explanation of his thesis.\r\n\r\nI have not seen other explanations for the simple and basic question, \"Why are there cresting and receding waves of SARS-CoV-2 infections?\"  At the beginning, Everybody Knew there was going to be a sigmoidal curve, the only questions were How Fast and How Big.
