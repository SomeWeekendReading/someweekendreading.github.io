message: "> Hello Dr. Weekend,\r\n\r\n\\*giggling out loud\\* Wow, the only person who used to call me \"doctor\" was my mother!  \r\n\r\nAnd BTW, I love the name \"CynthesisToday\".  I used to work with some absolutely brilliant\r\nmedchem people who could somehow design synthesis pipelines for battleship-sized molecules\r\nthat got reasonable yield and could be checked for assay drift to guarantee they were\r\nmaking the exact same molecule from week to week.  They were good folk to know.  \r\n\r\n> However, I have an entire branch of my family who are rabidly, toxically individualistic\r\n> wrt COVID. They haven’t asked me and I haven’t engaged them. Rabid and toxic are\r\n> strongly deterrent.  \r\n\r\nNothing but sympathy from me.  I have some similar friends and relatives, who refuse _all_\r\nvaccines for _everything_ on some religious basis or other with which I won't engage either.  \r\n\r\nSo I sympathize with the terrible situation you're in, because I'm in it too.  \r\n\r\n> Estimations and modeling aside (as documented in the Townsend article), is re-infection\r\n> after \"natural\" COVID-19 infection more likely to happen and to produce greater\r\n> morbidity/mortality?  \r\n>  \r\n> &hellip;  \r\n>  \r\n> So, two points of question: more likely re-infection and/or greater morbidity/mortality?\r\n\r\nI think the real, and frustrating, truth is that we really don't know.  \r\n- On the one hand, I've seen reports like yours that 'natural' immunity after infection is\r\n  quite strong.  \r\n- On the other hand, I've seen and\r\n  blogged about [a study which found the opposite](../vax-better/), at\r\n  least in terms of ab levels.  \r\n\r\nAnd apparently all of that changes with the onset of Delta, because nothing is ever\r\nallowed to be simple.  All the studies showing waning vaccine efficacy show the waning\r\nstarting _almost exactly_ at the time Delta arose.  So it's hard to say whether immunity\r\nwanes on a 9 month timescale, or we just happened to get smacked in the face with Delta 9\r\nmonths after the start of mass vaccinations.  \r\n\r\nWhat I _can_ say is that boosters are safe and effective, based on the data shown at the\r\nVRBPAC and ACIP meetings.  \r\n- So if there's a waning effect, this is a good strategy.  \r\n- If there's no waning effect, at least it's a _safe_ strategy, as there's not much downside to\r\n  boosters.  \r\n\r\nNow, there is an effect called\r\n[antibody affinity maturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation)\r\nwhere the immune system actually learns to make better antibodies over time.  That _might_\r\nlead to increased immunity with repeated re-infection. If you want to read some of the\r\nliterature, just Google \"antibody affinity maturation\".  A lot of the top hits look pretty\r\ngood to me, though I'm not an immunologist.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the risk of MI, PE, and stroke on each infection looks like a huge risk\r\nto take to get that affinity maturation, when you could also get it with periodic\r\nvaccination boosters and be exposed to _none_ of those risks.  \r\n\r\nSo depending on increased natural immunity &ndash; via affinity maturation or something\r\nelse &ndash; is a huge gamble.  Getting vaccinated is not very much of a gamble at all,\r\ngiven the rarity of serious side effects.  _That_ risk comparison is sort of what I was\r\ntrying to communicate.  \r\n\r\nThe overly simple-minded model here was intended to be accessible to people who don't want\r\nto read through the differential equations of a SIR model, but just to see some simple\r\narithmetic and a clear conclusion.  \r\n\r\n- You can fiddle with my estimate of mortality (is 3% mortality averaged over repeated\r\n  re-infections too high or too low?), or  \r\n- you can fiddle with the fraction of the population who are resisters (after getting\r\n  re-infected a couple of times, might they change their mind so the vaccine resistant\r\n  fraction goes down faster?), or  \r\n- you can fiddle with the Townsend, _et al._ estimate of the rate of re-infection (does\r\n  affinity maturation eventually drive down re-infection?), or  \r\n- you could postulate improved treatments that\r\n  like molnupiravir for infected patients that would reduce the mortality rate (will we find\r\n  more drugs like molnupiravir, or combination therapies of existing drugs?), &hellip;\r\n\r\nand so on.  \r\n\r\nAll of those will change the final output number of deaths, probably drastically since it's\r\nextrapolating an exponential.  But what _won't_ change is those deaths will be mostly\r\nneedless, avoidable by vaccination.  \r\n\r\nAnd that's the point I was trying to get across to the vaccine hesitant:  \r\n- It looks for now, based on what we know today, that there will be re-infections.  \r\n- It's hard to believe that the mortality rate there will be nontrivial; repeatedly playing\r\n  of Russian roulette is a bad idea.  \r\n  \r\nSo sorry I can't nail down data that will immediately help you convince your relatives to\r\nbe vaccinated.  I wish I could be of more help.  (And of course none of this is medical advice, because I'm not _that_ kind of doctor.  Even more importantly, I'm not _your_ doctor.)"
