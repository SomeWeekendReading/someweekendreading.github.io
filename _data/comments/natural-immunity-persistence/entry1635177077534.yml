message: "Hello Dr. Weekend, \r\n\r\nFirst, I'd like to thank you for providing your experienced perspective on the world of pharma in the presence of the COVID pandemic.\r\n\r\nSecond, I am a retired Chemical Engineer with decades of experience in statistical experimental design and analysis. I appreciate your sharing the details of your statistical analyses with a practiced eye myself.\r\n\r\nThird, I practice vaccination including for COVID and am currently awaiting my time interval for a booster to pass so I can get my booster. I've gotten my flu shot in the interim as I do every year. My immediate community is also very highly vaccinated for COVID-- no arguments against COVID vaccinations. However, I have an entire branch of my family who are rabidly, toxically individualistic wrt COVID. They haven't asked me and I haven't engaged them. Rabid and toxic are strongly deterrent.\r\n\r\nNow that I have that background out of the way, my thoughts/questions about your above post:\r\n\r\nThere are at least two points I have struggled to find consistent support for. I would welcome your insight (especially references).\r\n\r\nEstimations and modeling aside (as documented in the Townsend article), is re-infection after \"natural\" COVID-19 infection more likely to happen and to produce greater morbidity/mortality? I found this article: DOI: 10.1177/01632787211047932 which reviews 10 studies from around the world and concludes, based on over 9M individuals, \"The protective effect of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection on re-infection is high and similar to the protective effect of vaccination.\" The paper also provides reference to \"Other studies have also described reduced risk of infection, morbidity, and mortality among those with prior COVID-19.\"  To be sure, all of these studies were completed before Delta became prominent with the last one through published in June 2021. So, two points of question: more likely re-infection _and_/_or_ greater morbidity/mortality?\r\n\r\nI agree that we are all only getting older (and so always entering greater risk category as time passes). I agree that the trend in human health, especially in the USA and Western countries in particular, is increasing obesity and other non-communicable diseases with increased morbidity/mortality risk wrt COVID infection. I agree the current (Summer/Fall 2021) hospitalization data shows the vast majority of ICU hospitalized are non-vaccinated. \r\n\r\nI'm asking these questions because I saw your post as the only possible avenue available to change the actions of that branch of the family I mentioned above. They don't care about others, only about themselves as individuals. I saw your post as a way to address that toxic individuality. I have one niece in that branch who I might get a toe-hold with. I think I have one and only one chance with her so I want to be completely solid with backing data I feel confident in. I accept the conclusion of the model but I also know I want data that supports that conclusion in real life. \r\n\r\nMy approach with that branch was to point out the we're all getting older/covid risk category and what that means relative to her baby (currently 11 mo. old). If she wants to see him in adulthood, 18 years from now or average Townsend-model, 12 COVID infections from now, she should want to get vaccination. I'm preparing myself for one and only one attempt but I need to know there is data from real life to support repeat infections lead to increased morbidity/mortality.\r\n\r\nI know we're early in this pandemic and that real-life data post-vaccination is only now being collected. I think I'm going to hold off on my one and only attempt until that data becomes available/peer-review analyzed. I'm prepared to step-back from that branch and let Darwin do his thing. Results will out even if it takes several years for the evidence to become clear.\r\n\r\nI hope you continue your posts evaluating data. I hope you keep an eye out for results wrt re-infection rates, morbidity and mortality. \r\n\r\nI appreciate your efforts. Continued good health to you and yours."
