message: "Pfizer claims 200,000 courses available this year, and 80 million next year. \r\n\r\n--This doesn't tell us much about the time frame we're looking at, beyond minimal availability before 2022.  It sounds like a gradual ramp up that will mismatch the exponential ramp up of Omicron.  If we didn't have litigation concerns, we could maximize the likely efficacy of each dose by delegating the prescription decisions to doctors who were informed of the degree of shortage.  Or they could use something like the Charlson Index, slightly modified to correlate more closely to observed morbidity in Covid patients. Instead, we'll probably have a cruder, less efficient triage situation."
