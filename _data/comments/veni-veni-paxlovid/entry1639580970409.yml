message: "No question: it will be tricky, especially with initial supply constraints.  \r\n\r\nGiven the likelihood that ritonavir interacts with prescriptions already being taken, it will require a physician who knows drug interactions and who’s willing to take a close look at the patient before prescribing.  And given the fear of resistance mutations if used too widely, I'm betting the FDA &amp; CDC authorize it for a high-risk population only.  \r\n\r\nBut I’m afraid that observing American reactions to the pandemic has turned me from an idealist to a cynic. We’ll probably just fight about it. There are already conspiracy theories claiming paxlovid is repackaged ivermectin at a higher price, so they call it “Pfizermectin”.  \r\n\r\nI honestly just don’t know what to do about stuff like that."
