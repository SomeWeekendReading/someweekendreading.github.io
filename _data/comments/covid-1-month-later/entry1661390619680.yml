message: "First, welcome to the Weekend Commentariat!\r\n\r\nSecond, thanks for the info on the BA.4 and BA.5 spike proteins.  This would explain why people always say \"BA.4/5\" (other than just sloppy terminology).  Still, they're not _identical_, so I wonder which one is in the vaccine or if they used both?\r\n\r\nI appreciate your diligence in digging this up for me.  Normally, I'd just say I was being lazy.  But the post-COVID-19 fatigue and (essentially) brain fog have really slowed me down.  So glad to hear someone's checking the details for me."
