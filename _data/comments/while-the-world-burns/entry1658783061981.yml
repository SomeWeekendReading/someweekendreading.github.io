message: "I'm no Republican. My bona fides: donated to Obama and Klobuchar, canvassed for Obama, and voted Dem more often that not, including for Biden.\r\n\r\nYet...\r\n\r\nWhy does anyone vote Republican? Well, it's not because they're all stupid and crazy. It's because there are only two options. To save the planet, you also need to line up behind the rest of the Democratic platform, where reasonable minds can disagree on at least *some* of the issues advanced by the Dems, especially in the last few years. I disagree with Dems on a *lot* despite my prior support. And some of what they support is just plain bonkers, just like their friends on the right.\r\n\r\nSo - Republicans are nutjobs about some stuff. But all the Democrats need to do is to avoid being nutjobs about other things. They can't reign in the extreme-left arm of their party, and flirt with Populists just like the Republicans did (and do). Without a viable third party anywhere on the horizon, it's going to cost them votes and it may well cost them mine.\r\n\r\nGive this a listen, if you're interested. Not much you probably don't know, but we can fix much of this (including any one Senator having a stranglehold on things) by some of what's suggested here. But spoiler alert: neither the Dems nor Republicans will be interested.\r\nhttps://mightyheaton.com/the-political-orphanage/the-duopoly-hates-third-parties"
