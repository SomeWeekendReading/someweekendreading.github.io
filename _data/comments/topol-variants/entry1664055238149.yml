message: "Very interesting, thanks!\r\n\r\nI wonder why Johnson, who did the graphic above of mutation subset relationships, didn't say much about BA.2.75.2's immune evasion?\r\n\r\nAlso, if BQ.1.1 really <em>does</em> evade <em>both</em> evusheld <em>and</em> bebtelovimab, then we're left with no effective antibody therapies whatsoever.  I really, really do <em>not</em> like that thought."
