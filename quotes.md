without plowing up the ground.  They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the
ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.  This struggle may be a moral one; or it
may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a

their utmost to say nothing at all." 
&mdash; [Piercamillo Davigo](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piercamillo_Davigo), an Italian
judge investigating corrupt politicians  

"Wooden-headedness is a factor that plays a large role in government.  It consists in
assessing a situation in terms of preconceived fixed notions while ignoring or rejecting
any contrary signs.  It is acting according to wish while not allowing oneself to be
deflected by the facts.  It is epitomized in a historian's statement about Phillip II of
Spain, the surpassing wooden-head of all sovereigns: No experience of the failure of his
policy could shake his belief in its essential excellence."

"When the facts change, I change my mind.  What do you do, sir?" 
&mdash; [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes)  

"The 'purposive' man is always trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his
acts by pushing his interest in them forward into time. He does not love his cat, but his
cat’s kittens; nor, in truth, the kittens, but only the kittens’ kittens, and so on
forward forever to the end of cat-dom. For him jam is not jam unless it is a case of jam
to-morrow and never jam to-day. Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he
strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality."
&mdash; [John Maynard Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes), ["Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren"](http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/1930/our-grandchildren.htm)

1925 in the process of being one of the founders of quantum mechanics

"What is true is already so.  
Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.  
Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away.

"&hellip; if you were ignorant about a phenomenon, that was a fact about your own state of mind, not
a fact about the phenomenon itself; that your uncertainty was a fact about you, not a fact

"There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old’s life: The _Lord of the Rings_ and _Atlas Shrugged_.

"If the matter is one that can be settled by observation, make the observation yourself.  Aristotle could have avoided the mistake of thinking that women have fewer teeth than men, by the simple device of asking Mrs. Aristotle to keep her mouth open while he counted.  He did not do so because he thought he knew. Thinking that you know when in fact you don't is a fatal mistake, to which we are all prone. &hellip; If, like most of mankind, you have passionate convictions on many such matters, there are ways in which you can make yourself aware of your own bias.

"Once for all, then, a short precept is given you: Love, and do what you will:
whether you hold your peace, through love hold your peace; whether you cry out,
through love cry out; whether you correct, through love correct; whether you spare,

spring but what is good. &mdash;

"Often a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other
parts of the world, about the motions and orbits of the stars and even their sizes and
distances,&hellip;  and this knowledge he holds with certainty from reason and
experience. It is thus offensive and disgraceful for an unbeliever to hear a Christian
talk nonsense about such things, claiming that what he is saying is based in
Scripture. We should do all that we can to avoid such an embarrassing situation, lest
the unbeliever see only ignorance in the Christian and laugh to scorn."

_De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim_ (_The Literal Meaning of Genesis_)  

"It is said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into numbers.  That is
false: tragically false.  Look for yourself.  This is the concentration camp and
crematorium at Auschwitz.  This is where people were turned into numbers.  Into this
pond were flushed the ashes of four million people.  And that was not done by gas.  It
was done by arrogance.  It was done by dogma.  It was done by ignorance.  When people
believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality &mdash; this is how
they behave.  This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods&hellip;
In the end, the words were said by Oliver Cromwell: 'I beseech you, in the bowels of

"They lied to you. The Devil is not the Prince of Matter; the Devil is the arrogance of
the spirit, faith without smile, truth that is never seized by doubt. The Devil is grim

"I believe what really happens in history is this: the old man is always wrong; and the

this: that, while the old man may stand by some stupid custom, the young man always
attacks it with some theory that turns out to be equally stupid."

"Above all, the prophets remind us of the moral state of a people: __Few are guilty, but all
are responsible.__ If we admit that the individual is in some measure conditioned or
affected by the spirit of society, an individual’s crime discloses society’s
corruption. In a community not indifferent to suffering, uncompromisingly impatient with
cruelty and falsehood, continually concerned for God and every \[person\], crime would be
infrequent rather than common."

"We want experiences, fitting ones, of profound connection with others, of deep
understanding of natural phenomena, of love, of being profoundly moved by music or
tragedy, or doing something new and innovative, experiences very different from the bounce

is a fitting response to &mdash; and then to give it that response."

- Original Danish: "Det er ganske sandt, hvad Philosophien siger, at Livet maa forstaaes baglaends. Men derover glemmer man den anden Saetning, at det maa leves forlaends. Hvilken Saetning, jo meer den gjennemtaenkes, netop ender med, at Livet i Timeligheden aldrig ret bliver forstaaeligt, netop fordi jeg intet Øieblik kan faae fuldelig Ro til at indtage Stillingen: baglaends."  
- English: "It is really true what philosophy tells us, that life must be understood backwards. But with this, one forgets the second proposition, that it must be lived forwards. A proposition which, the more it is subjected to careful thought, the more it ends up concluding precisely that life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood; exactly because there is no single moment where time stops completely in order for me to take position [to do this]: going backwards."  
- Often shortened to: "Livet skal forstaas baglaens, men leves forlaens." (Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.)  

"Equity bids us to be merciful to the weakness of human nature; to think less about

much as his intentions, nor this or that detail so much as the whole story."
&mdash; [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)  

"Pragmatists explained that Truth is what it pays to believe. Historians of morals reduced the Good to a matter of tribal custom. Beauty was abolished by artists in a revolt against the sugary insipidities of a philistine epoch and in a mood of fury in which satisfaction is to be derived only from what hurts. And so the world was swept clear not only of God as a person but of God's essence as an ideal to which man owed an ideal allegiance."

"I am sometimes shocked by the blasphemies of those who think themselves pious – for instance, the nuns who never take a bath without wearing a bathrobe all the time. When asked why, since no man can see them, they reply: 'Oh, but you forget the good God.' Apparently they conceive of the Deity as a Peeping Tom, whose omnipotence enables Him to see through bathroom walls, but who is foiled by bathrobes. This view strikes me as curious."

[_The Best Care Possible: A Physician’s Quest to Transform Care Through the End of Life_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12669445-the-best-care-possible) (Avery, 2012).  Byock goes on to explain: "&hellip; broken femur that has healed is evidence that someone has taken time to stay with the one who fell, has bound up the wound, has carried the person to safety and has tended the person through recovery. Helping someone else through difficulty is where civilization starts. We are at our best when we serve others. Be civilized."  (It appears, though, that Mead never said anything like this.)  

"Men, like poets, rush 'into the middest', _in medias res_, when they
are born; they also die _in mediis rebus_, and to make sense of their span they
need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems.
The End they imagine will reflect their irreducibly intermediary preoccupations.  They
fear it, and as far as we can see have always done so; the End is a figure for their own deaths."

"Compassion is probably the only antitoxin of the soul. Where there is compassion even the most poisonous impulses remain relatively harmless. One would rather see the world run by men who set their hearts on toys but are accessible to pity, than by men animated by lofty ideals whose dedication makes them ruthless.

## The One Who Is Voltaire  

[Fran&ccedil;ois-Marie Arouet, a.k.a. "Voltaire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire), 
(1694-1778):  

- "Optimism is the madness of insisting that all is well when we are miserable." &mdash; [_Candide_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide)  
- "The English gain two hours a day more than we do, by eating their syllables." &mdash; quoted in [Erin McKean, "The Word", Boston Globe Ideas section, 2010-Oct-31](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/10/31/pithy/)  
- "No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible."  
- "Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is absurd."  
- "Il est dangereux d’avoir raison dans des choses où des hommes accrédités ont tort." (It is dangerous to be right on matters where the authorities are wrong.)  
- "A witty saying proves nothing."  (To which your Weekend Editor adds: including this one.)  
- "Dans ce pays-ci, il est bon de tuer de temps en temps un amiral pour encourager les autres."  (In this country, it is good to kill an admiral from time to time, to encourage the others.)  
- "If there were only one religion in England there would be danger of despotism; if there were two they would cut each other's throats. But there are thirty, and they live in peace and happiness."  
- "Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities."  
- "Every man is guilty of the good he didn't do."  
- "What is tolerance?  It is the consequence of humanity.  We are all formed of frailty and error; let us pardon reciprocally each other's folly &ndash; that is the first law of nature."  
- "Think for yourselves and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too."  
- "I am very fond of truth, but not at all of martyrdom."  
- "Anything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung."  (To which your Weekend Editor adds: hence, the origin of American musical theatre.)  
- "Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well."  
- "I advise you to go on living solely to enrage those who are paying you annuities."  
- "It is one of the superstitions of the human mind to have imagined that virginity could be a virtue."  
- "So far from believing in nothing, I can believe in witchcraft and am confident that with incantations (and arsenic) it is possible to poison a flock of sheep!" (upon accusation of atheism)  
- "I die adoring God, loving my friends, not hating my enemies, and detesting superstition."  (Whereupon he did _not_ die, at least not for some months more.)

- "Freedom is the mastery of form."  
- "There is no evolutionary premium on elegance.  Life is a kludge."  
- "&lsquo;This sentence is true&rsquo; &ndash; why wasn't [Epimenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimenides_paradox) as outraged by this as the other one?"  
- "Serendipity is wherever you find it."

- "Just because you see an example of something being done badly doesn't mean it cannot also be done well."  
- "Scientists talk about nature; cranks talk about themselves."  
- "It never pays to humiliate an opponent.  Defeat, disarm, divert, coopt, compromise, befriend, &hellip; never humiliate."  
- "If you're gonna lose your grip on reality, let go with _both_ hands.  No half measures!"  
- "If you don't have a solution, you can always admire the problem."

- "Bayesians are enamoured of prior knowledge.  Or is it prior prejudice?  You don't know which, because it's _prior_!"  
- "Should you find you've shot yourself in the foot, it's time to pause and reflect, not
  reload.  That's Bayes Rule!"
