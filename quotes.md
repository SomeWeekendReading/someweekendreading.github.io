While Aeschylus may have a point, _we can do better._  And should.  

"I must study politics and war, that our sons may have liberty to study mathematics and

porcelain." &mdash; [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams), 2nd president

"Those who seek power are not worthy to hold it." &mdash; [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), though more of a 'folk quotation' than a real one.  The general sentiment is expressed with different wording in [_Republic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)) I 347B-E.  

"One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors." &ndash; [Plato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato), [_Republic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)), Book 1, 347c.

in 1798, after the passage of the 
[Alien and Sedition Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_sedition_acts).
Problem is, "a little patience" is wearing thin; I've been patient since the debacles

"Never believe that anti-Semites are completely unaware of the absurdity of their
replies. They know that their remarks are frivolous, open to challenge. But they are
amusing themselves, for it is their adversary who is obliged to use words responsibly,
since he believes in words. The anti-Semites have the right to play. They even like to
play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of
their interlocutors. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade
by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they
will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is
past." &mdash; [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre); true of
the fact-free nihilistic of the right-wing in general, not _just_ anti-Semites.

entirely on the power of the man who can fabricate it."
&mdash; [Hannah Arendt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt), 
_The Origins of Totalitarianism_, 1973, p. 350.  

"In war you will generally find that the enemy has at any time three courses of action open to him. Of those three, he will invariably choose the fourth." &mdash; [Helmuth von Moltke the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder) (quoted in ["Hunting for Foxes: Capturing the Potential of Outlier Ideas in the Intelligence Community" by C Watts &amp; J Brennan, in the CIA journal _Studies in Intelligence_ 55:4 (2012)](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol.-55-no.-4/capturing-the-potential-of-outlier-ideas-in-the-intelligence-community.html), via [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/04/outliers_in_int.html))

treasonable to the American public." 
&mdash; President [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_roosevelt)

1866 letter to Conservative MP [Sir John Pakington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakington)

opinion." &mdash; [Thomas Sowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sowell) (though in
general, I don't care much for his other opinions)

"Those who profess to favor freedom, yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops
without plowing up the ground.  They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the
ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.  This struggle may be a moral one; or it
may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a
struggle.  Power concedes nothing without a demand.  It never did and it never will."

"Wooden-headedness is a factor that plays a large role in government.  It consists in
assessing a situation in terms of preconceived fixed notions while ignoring or rejecting
any contrary signs.  It is acting according to wish while not allowing oneself to be
deflected by the facts.  It is epitomized in a historian's statement about Phillip II of
Spain, the surpassing wooden-head of all sovereigns: No experience of the failure of his
policy could shake his belief in its essential excellence."

"The 'purposive' man is always trying to secure a spurious and delusive immortality for his
acts by pushing his interest in them forward into time. He does not love his cat, but his
cat’s kittens; nor, in truth, the kittens, but only the kittens’ kittens, and so on
forward forever to the end of cat-dom. For him jam is not jam unless it is a case of jam
to-morrow and never jam to-day. Thus by pushing his jam always forward into the future, he
strives to secure for his act of boiling it an immortality."

"If the matter is one that can be settled by observation, make the observation yourself.  Aristotle could have avoided the mistake of thinking that women have fewer teeth than men, by the simple device of asking Mrs. Aristotle to keep her mouth open while he counted.  He did not do so because he thought he knew. Thinking that you know when in fact you don't is a fatal mistake, to which we are all prone. &hellip; If, like most of mankind, you have passionate convictions on many such matters, there are ways in which you can make yourself aware of your own bias. If an opinion contrary to your own makes you angry, that is a sign that you are subconsciously aware of having no good reason for thinking as you do."

"In physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it. I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of _science_, whatever the matter may be." &mdash; physicist [William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomson,_1st_Baron_Kelvin) (1824 - 1907), [_Popular Lectures and Addresses_](https://www.google.com/books/edition/_/JcMKAAAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=In%20physical%20science%20a%20first%20essential%20step), Vol. I, 1891, p. 80.

"Statistical and applied probabilistic knowledge is the core of knowledge; statistics is
what tells you if something is true, false, or merely anecdotal; it is the 'logic of
science'; it is the instrument of risk-taking; it is the applied tools of epistemology;

  Nothing quite matching this quote is in there.

through love do you spare: let the root of love be within, of this root can nothing
spring but what is good." &mdash;

"Often a non-Christian knows something about the earth, the heavens, and the other
parts of the world, about the motions and orbits of the stars and even their sizes and
distances,&hellip;  and this knowledge he holds with certainty from reason and
experience. It is thus offensive and disgraceful for an unbeliever to hear a Christian
talk nonsense about such things, claiming that what he is saying is based in
Scripture. We should do all that we can to avoid such an embarrassing situation, lest
the unbeliever see only ignorance in the Christian and laugh to scorn."

_De Genesi ad litteram libri duodecim_ (_The Literal Meaning of Genesis_)  

"It is said that science will dehumanize people and turn them into numbers.  That is
false: tragically false.  Look for yourself.  This is the concentration camp and
crematorium at Auschwitz.  This is where people were turned into numbers.  Into this
pond were flushed the ashes of four million people.  And that was not done by gas.  It
was done by arrogance.  It was done by dogma.  It was done by ignorance.  When people
believe that they have absolute knowledge, with no test in reality &mdash; this is how
they behave.  This is what men do when they aspire to the knowledge of gods&hellip;
In the end, the words were said by Oliver Cromwell: 'I beseech you, in the bowels of
Christ: Think it possible you may be mistaken.'" &mdash; Jacob Bronowski, _The Ascent of
Man_  

"They lied to you. The Devil is not the Prince of Matter; the Devil is the arrogance of
the spirit, faith without smile, truth that is never seized by doubt. The Devil is grim
because he knows where he is going, and, in moving, he always returns whence he came."

"Above all, the prophets remind us of the moral state of a people: _Few are guilty, but all
are responsible._ If we admit that the individual is in some measure conditioned or
affected by the spirit of society, an individual’s crime discloses society’s
corruption. In a community not indifferent to suffering, uncompromisingly impatient with
cruelty and falsehood, continually concerned for God and every \[person\], crime would be
infrequent rather than common."

"We want experiences, fitting ones, of profound connection with others, of deep
understanding of natural phenomena, of love, of being profoundly moved by music or
tragedy, or doing something new and innovative, experiences very different from the bounce

_Journalen_ JJ:167 (1843)  
- Original Danish: "Det er ganske sandt, hvad Philosophien siger, at Livet maa forstaaes baglaends. Men derover glemmer man den anden Saetning, at det maa leves forlaends. Hvilken Saetning, jo meer den gjennemtaenkes, netop ender med, at Livet i Timeligheden aldrig ret bliver forstaaeligt, netop fordi jeg intet Øieblik kan faae fuldelig Ro til at indtage Stillingen: baglaends."  
- English: "It is really true what philosophy tells us, that life must be understood backwards. But with this, one forgets the second proposition, that it must be lived forwards. A proposition which, the more it is subjected to careful thought, the more it ends up concluding precisely that life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood; exactly because there is no single moment where time stops completely in order for me to take position [to do this]: going backwards."  
- Often shortened to: "Livet skal forstaas baglaens, men leves forlaens." (Life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forwards.)  

"Equity bids us to be merciful to the weakness of human nature; to think less about

much as his intentions, nor this or that detail so much as the whole story."
&mdash; [Aristotle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)  

"Pragmatists explained that Truth is what it pays to believe. Historians of morals reduced the Good to a matter of tribal custom. Beauty was abolished by artists in a revolt against the sugary insipidities of a philistine epoch and in a mood of fury in which satisfaction is to be derived only from what hurts. And so the world was swept clear not only of God as a person but of God's essence as an ideal to which man owed an ideal allegiance."

"I am sometimes shocked by the blasphemies of those who think themselves pious – for instance, the nuns who never take a bath without wearing a bathrobe all the time. When asked why, since no man can see them, they reply: 'Oh, but you forget the good God.' Apparently they conceive of the Deity as a Peeping Tom, whose omnipotence enables Him to see through bathroom walls, but who is foiled by bathrobes. This view strikes me as curious."

[_The Best Care Possible: A Physician’s Quest to Transform Care Through the End of Life_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12669445-the-best-care-possible) (Avery, 2012).  Byock goes on to explain: "&hellip; broken femur that has healed is evidence that someone has taken time to stay with the one who fell, has bound up the wound, has carried the person to safety and has tended the person through recovery. Helping someone else through difficulty is where civilization starts. We are at our best when we serve others. Be civilized."  (It appears, though, that Mead never said anything like this.)  

"Men, like poets, rush 'into the middest', _in medias res_, when they
are born; they also die _in mediis rebus_, and to make sense of their span they
need fictive concords with origins and ends, such as give meaning to lives and to poems.
The End they imagine will reflect their irreducibly intermediary preoccupations.  They
fear it, and as far as we can see have always done so; the End is a figure for their own deaths."

"Compassion is probably the only antitoxin of the soul. Where there is compassion even the most poisonous impulses remain relatively harmless. One would rather see the world run by men who set their hearts on toys but are accessible to pity, than by men animated by lofty ideals whose dedication makes them ruthless.

Good sometimes looks like evil, evil often looks like good, and there's some jerk with the head of a lion and the body of a snake psyching us out at every turn. Do we trust the priests?

## The One Who Is Voltaire  

[Fran&ccedil;ois-Marie Arouet, a.k.a. "Voltaire"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire), 
(1694-1778):  

- "Optimism is the madness of insisting that all is well when we are miserable." &mdash; [_Candide_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide)  
- "The English gain two hours a day more than we do, by eating their syllables." &mdash; quoted in [Erin McKean, "The Word", Boston Globe Ideas section, 2010-Oct-31](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/10/31/pithy/)  
- "No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible."  
- "Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is absurd."  
- "Il est dangereux d’avoir raison dans des choses où des hommes accr&eacute;dit&eacute;s ont tort." (It is dangerous to be right on matters where the authorities are wrong.)  
- "A witty saying proves nothing."  (To which your Weekend Editor adds: including this one.)  
- "Dans ce pays-ci, il est bon de tuer de temps en temps un amiral pour encourager les autres."  (In this country, it is good to kill an admiral from time to time, to encourage the others.)  
- "If there were only one religion in England there would be danger of despotism; if there were two they would cut each other's throats. But there are thirty, and they live in peace and happiness."  
- "Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities."  (A loose translation from the original, in _Questions sur les miracles_, 1765: "Certainement qui est en droit de vous rendre absurde est en droit de vous rendre injuste.")  
- "Every man is guilty of the good he didn't do."  
- "What is tolerance?  It is the consequence of humanity.  We are all formed of frailty and error; let us pardon reciprocally each other's folly &ndash; that is the first law of nature."  
- "Think for yourselves and let others enjoy the privilege to do so too."  
- "I am very fond of truth, but not at all of martyrdom."  
- "Anything that is too stupid to be spoken is sung."  (To which your Weekend Editor adds: hence, the origin of American musical theatre.)  
- "Appreciation is a wonderful thing: It makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well."

He's speaking of 
[some letters exchanged between Pascal & Fermat](https://www.york.ac.uk/depts/maths/histstat/pascal.pdf), 
working out the basics of probability in gambling.

[interview in CNN Money 14-May-2008](https://money.cnn.com/2008/05/12/pf/soros_interview.moneymag/index.htm?postversion=2008051404).

  [Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Rimsky-Korsakov)'s

  Apparently Rimsky-Korsakov, a Russian, never set foot in Spain?  He just listend to
  their music, liked the stuff, and probably thought "Hey, I could do some of that!"  He
  also probably misunderstood some of the finer points of late 1800s Spanish music. (E.g.,
  marking the violin parts in the 4th movement "_quasi guitara_" &ndash; "sorta like a guitar".)

  After decades of psychotherapy, most of it's now safely crammed behind a thick vault door with
  the skull and crossbones logo of the Pandora Vault Company.  The warning on the door (of
  _course_ there's a warning on the door!) says, 'Do Not Open Until __Never__'.  I _don't_
  need any 'recreational' pharmaceuticals making me wonder what happens if I open that
  door.  Clear?  Your mileage may vary, but that's mine."
